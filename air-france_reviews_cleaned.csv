"Terrible experience, lost bag, stolen items, worst customer service",Raleigh,Paris,International,"Air France has been by far the worst airline experience we've ever had. It's supposedly a Delta partner and we have Gold Medallion status so we thought booking through them would be a good choice. Their publicly stated policy says that they honor Delta status members with a free checked bag, yet I was charged to and from my destination. On the way back, our bags also got delayed which RDU staff said is a regular occurrence with the airline. When we received our bag, we had valuable items stolen, including a luxury purse. 

All of this happened about a month ago and I'm still dealing with customer service. I tried using their text and phone lines but no one was able to help and all I could do was submit a ticket on their website.

Absolutely Horrible Experience with Air France ‚Äì Do Not Use This Airline!,Sydney,Paris,International,"I‚Äôve never been more disappointed with an airline in my life. Air France is an absolute disaster from start to finish. The company is poorly organized, and the staff is equally terrible. It seems like the executives of this airline have no clue how to run a business. Their agreements with other companies are completely useless ‚Äì we couldn‚Äôt even check in online because their systems don‚Äôt communicate with each other! How is that even possible in this day and age?

What‚Äôs worse, when two people are traveling together, they split up the family and then offer upgrades to other passengers to sit together. It‚Äôs absurd! So, if you want to make sure you‚Äôre sitting next to your travel companion, forget it ‚Äì you‚Äôll probably end up on opposite sides of the plane.

It‚Äôs clear Air France doesn‚Äôt know the first thing about customer service. If they can‚Äôt manage something as simple as checking in passengers and seating families together, how can we trust them to maintain their airplanes? Honestly, I wouldn‚Äôt feel safe flying with them again.

Air France/JFK Baggage Nightmare,Paris,New York City,International,"Stewart Shaw
AF # 008 from CDG to JFK arrived Wednesday, 12/4/24 evening. Well over 1 hour and more than 100 passengers waiting for baggage to arrive at Carousel #4 in Terminal 1. After this inexcusably long wait which never saw an agent come and announce to all the inconvenienced passengers waiting why the reason for this insufferable delay. My bag didn't appear, the carousel stopped, the agent said there were no more bags and to report to the other baggage agent. They scanned my Baggage Claim ticket and it tracked back to CDG. I filled out all the info they asked for, name, address, phone, email and they promised to send it when it arrived. I asked the agent twice, if they were sure, did they need anymore info from me but they insisted I was done and to go home and they promised to deliver my bag to me. I live 2 1/2 hours away from the airport in North Ulster county, NY. The next morning, a woman named Fiji called from Air France baggage at JFK and said, my bag WAS on my flight after all. And since it was on my flight, THEY WON'T PAY TO SEND IT TO ME!! It's their ""rule"". I explained everything, that it was obviously their fault, not mine. I never would've never left the airport without my suitcase. They had told me it would be taken care of, to go home, and now this nonsense! They are very cavalier and unprofessional. I'm 65, don't have a car and would have to pay my way by bus, train, subway there and back, about $100, taking all day because they screwed up royally and I'm the one punished for their dumb mistakes. I've spent hours on the phone, in chat, even calling baggage service in France and even though they understand the situation they are uncooperative and un-accomodating. I am begging to have this case escalated to someone in authority and have it resoved fairly. Thus far, my 1st experience with Air France has been disgraceful and unacceptable!

Feeling cheated by Air France,Ottawa,Paris,International,"Travelling to a family funeral with my husband and two sons, I booked 2 seats with luggage and reserved seats and 2 seats without either. Air France notified us of a change for the short leg of the trip, explaining the change in plane, and kept us seated together. However, Air France did not notify us that they had changed our seats for the longer flight, putting us in different sections of the plane without explanation. We learned at pre check-in time that this was the case. We proceeded to changing our seats. The only contiguous seats on the Air France site that were available came at the extra cost of over $130. Which, at this last minute, we paid. Our sons, who did not have reserved seats and did their pre check-in around the same time as us, were offered other seats than us on the Air France site, and obtained contiguous seats free of charge.

Air France‚Äôs client service absolutely refused to reimburse us, and could not explain why they separated us in the first place, nor why their site did not offer us free contiguous seats, when our sons had their pick.

Not really worth the extra money,Toronto,Paris,International,"First time flying AF Premium Economy.  While they tout Sky Priority perks, we found some if not very few were actually worth it.  Starting at luggage drop off, it was fairly good and easy at CDG.  You get 2 checked bags if you like but we always travel light.  Next was security.  This was a joke.  My daughter who was in regular economy actually went through faster.  So this part was a bust.  There is no access to lounges with the Premium ticket.  Is there an airline that offers this though???  Not sure. Boarding is zone 2 do it's supposed to be a nice boarding experience.  Did not feel that way especially at Pearson.  The gate we were at actually bottlenecks.  At CDG, it was a little better since it was a simple self- scan of the boarding pass. But then they made us wait in the tunnel.  Not good communication.  The seats are OK but Air Canada is roomier with a better configuration.  2 3,2 with only 3 rows for a total of 21 seats.  Air France on their 777 had a 2,4,2 layout with I believe we're 6 rows.  Felt a little crammed.  The seats and legroom we found were better with AC.  You get 2 water bottles at your seat with AF as well as blanket and pillow.  Blanket was actually nice.  Glass of champagne after takeoff with an amenities bag.  Video screen was a nice size as was the noise reducing headphones.  The choices of movies were only ok.  The wifi was hit and miss.  Most times did not work and kicked out.  The food was simply OK.  Was hoping for better.  Real silverware and a glass for your wine.  Digestif was also available.  Attention to passengers was limited which is why I prefer the AC Premium experience.   Snacks were actually not very good.  At arrivals, our Baggage was quick to come out because of Sky Priority tags.  Good advantage there.

Never again! Terrible service!,Paris,Hamburg,Europe,"Our connection flight was impossible to reach - along with several other passengers we ran from Terminal G to F, only to miss our connection. Time between flights was one hour. We did also ask to be moved forward both at the security and passport queues. Unfortunately no staff member was willing to help - even showing our baording passes. This is what we mentioned to the support staff at the Air France Desk. The staff member there was not surprised, not helpful and simply plain rude French. He printed out new boarding tickets for a flight 6.5 hours later(!) We did not get an apology - only a 15 EUR voucher; which at Paris-Charles de Gaulle is barely enough for a hot meal with a drink.

The staff member did make sure to book us separat seats, each middle seats in different rows. And guess what? The flight was not even full! We ended up moving to free seats so we could sit together.

We arrived at out destination over 7 hours too late! We contacted Air France referring to Directive No. 261/2004 , giving a passenger the right to a compensation of at least ‚Ç¨ 250. Air France argued that the flight connection was indeed possible to make. 

This way of behaving is in my opinion, fraudulent to say the least. If you ever travel with Air France and something goes wrong ‚Äì do not count on Air France to live up to any due responsibility or even to respect and follow established law.

The female staff member at the desk was rude. Had no name badge and now I can see why. Refused to provide her name for when I contacted customer service over her rudeness and the experience.  Claimed the plane was full and then claimed it was because we were in a certain section. She was just spouting nonsense. No one before us or after us was asked to check in the luggage. Everyone around us had their bags on the plane. We arrived 3 hours early but she claimed folk had already checked in and the plane was full. 
If it was too full how can you allow us to keep it for business class.

Air France is a fraudulent company.,Copenhagen,Paris,Europe,"Long story short: Flight from Copenhagen was scheduled to depart 12:05. The flight was delayed and AFTER the original departure time, a new departure time was announced to be 13:40 and thereafter changed a second time to 15:00. The flight was in fact delayed even further and departed from Copenhagen 16:52, and thus well over 3 hours delay. I contacted Air France referring to Directive No. 261/2004 , giving a passenger the right to a compensation of at least ‚Ç¨ 250. Air France first argued that the flight was not delayed beyond 3 hours. I then sent a copy of my physical boarding card clearly showing a departure time of 12:05. Air France then argued that they would not change their decision of refusing any compensation and that their decision was in line ""with company policies"" without outlining what those policies state. Not even when I requested an explanation why the EU-directive would be applicable, Air France even bothered to detail anything about it. It also deserves to be mentioned that the delay was not owing to any force majeure.

This way of behaving is in my opinion, fraudulent to say the least. If you ever travel with Air France and something goes wrong ‚Äì do not count on Air France to live up to any due responsibility or even to respect and follow established law.",2024-10,2024-11-26,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0

Avoid Air France at All Costs ‚Äì Horrible Experience!,Paris,Bari,Europe,"I recently had the misfortune of booking a flight with Air France, and I can confidently say it was one of the most frustrating and infuriating travel experiences I‚Äôve ever had.

I booked a one-way flight from Paris to Bari on October 19, 2024, through the Air France counter at EWR. I received confirmation and expected everything to go smoothly. However, upon arrival at CDG airport, I was shocked to learn that Air France had canceled my tickets without any notification or valid reason.

To make matters worse, Air France staff at CDG forced me to repurchase new tickets at an exorbitant cost of EUR 1,470.82 for the same route‚Äîa significant increase from my original ticket price of $529.60. Despite specifically requesting a one-way ticket, I was erroneously charged for a round-trip fare, further compounding their incompetence.

This fiasco didn‚Äôt stop there. Because of Air France‚Äôs blatant failure, I had to book an overnight hotel stay, costing me an additional $517.45. When I tried to speak with a manager at CDG to resolve the issue, I was outright denied access to anyone in authority. The customer service was non-existent, dismissive, and unhelpful.

What‚Äôs worse is that my credit card company confirmed the ticket cancellation originated from Air France‚Äôs system‚Äîa failure on their part that they refuse to take responsibility for.

Air France‚Äôs actions were deceitful, unprofessional, and inexcusable. They breached their contract, engaged in unauthorized billing, and left me scrambling to deal with the fallout of their incompetence. To date, I have not received any compensation or acknowledgment of their errors.

I strongly urge anyone considering Air France to look elsewhere. This airline clearly has no regard for its customers, and their poor management and predatory practices make them one of the worst airlines I have ever dealt with. Save yourself the trouble and book with a company that values your time and money.

We do not eat ham due to our religious beliefs, and the food server on your flight did not handle the situation appropriately. The way he expressed himself was unprofessional and disrespectful. Later, he served us a small extra almond cake, which felt like he was treating us as beggars. Let me clarify: we are not beggars to accept leftover food.

Additionally, we were traveling with a 6-year-old child who went without proper food during the flight. This was unacceptable.

Furthermore, while we understand that flight delays can happen, the gate change was not communicated to us.

"They separate my 12 yo and me, belittling my complaints",Los Angeles,Paris,International,"I recently traveled with my 12-year-old daughter on an Air France flight AF027 on Nov 6, and the experience was deeply disappointing. After our tickets are purchase, I contacted the customer service and was told the we will be assigned seats next to each other since we are PARENT and CHILD. On APP advance check-in, we were assigned seats 32J and 32K. However, at the counter, I received printed boarding passes showing one seat was moved to row 39, separating us.

This is unacceptable. Air France split a parent and child, despite my daughter being a minor. Yet, despite my efforts at the gate, the seats could not be adjusted, finally leaving us separated by an aisle at row 26. This was extremely frustrating.

I sent this complaint after our trip to Air France complaint website and got a message from Marielle Gracia, a customer care assistant, composing a long paragraph stating that seats are not guaranteed, ""a re-assignment of seat can occur in the case of security or safety requirements,"" ""our staff must provide and engender the essential sense of security, well-being, and overall value that today heralds the varied basis of any service provided by a major international airline."" This is ridiculous that her reply was not only dismissive but completely missed the point of my complaint. She did not read my complaint and used the generic statements which failed to address the core issue: why was a minor separated from her parent? Is this due to ""re-assigned seat due to safety requirements?"" Due to you are ""providing sense of security, well-being and overall value??""

I totally understand and would not care about seating while I am flying alone. However, per IATA and FAA guides you are not providing ""sense of security, well-being and overall value"" as you said.

Will start by adding that I flew business before with other major European flight companies, and the level of inflight quality of equipment, food and beverage, and most important, level of service on board from the flight crew, did not come close to this.

The cabin crew made this flight, this experience, the best one I've ever had!
So kind, so polite, so friendly and so over the top good at everything they did! It so happened that me and my wife, were on this flight heading out to our honeymoon.

Mister Patrick (I've had to ask for his name to make sure I mention it on my review, as he deserves ALL the praise possible) asked wether or not we informed the staff about this. We did not. From that moment on, he made it his mission to make sure our experience went from ""oh my, this flight is amazing"" to ""oh my, this people are amazing and this is the airline company that I will always recommend and choose to fly with!""

At Helsinki check in the attendant helped make sure everything was arranged for the flight back as well. Helsinki staff was great. When I got to the gate in Paris for the flight back to Helsinki I was denied preboarding because their staff wasn‚Äôt there to take my chair down to cargo. I explained I have mobility issues and a heart condition and couldn‚Äôt navigate the aisle with other people around. The gate agent told me it didn‚Äôt matter.

WORST AIRLINE,Dallas,Algiers,International,"I travel a lot - and I travel often. Last week I flew from Texas USA to Paris to Algiers - and then back the same way for the return flight. First before my trip I purchased luggage checked luggage and then after 2 weeks I saw that it wasn't showing on my ticket. So I call customer service and they said yeah we don't see it here. I told them okay. I have the confirmation from PayPal and also I have confirmation on my bank statement that they took out the full payment for the luggage and still they wouldn't fix the issue. Finally 3 days before my flight I had to call again and they finally put it on my ticket that I had paid for it. Then at the airport they give me many additional security screenings and at the Paris airport they weigh your carry-on bags that includes the backpack I had and my small carry-on luggage which has to be under 12 kg. Mine was 14 so I either had to pay $400 to check the bag. The small carry-on luggage bag or throw away all my clothes so I ended up having to throw away all my clothes because I don't have an extra $400 laying around to spare for a small luggage. No other airline or airport has this type of insanity where they weigh your carry-on bags, including your purse or your backpack and your personal item on the plane. Only Air France does this and only the Paris airport. Does this no other airline ways even your personal items and then tries to charge you $400 to check it. Also the Air front staff is always rude except for the staff on the plane like the flight attendants. But the in airport staffs and any airport are always very rude and they don't like to help be helpful or give information. All the Air France flights leak condensation from the top. This happened on all Air France planes to and from my destination. Go look at the reviews for Air France and you will see that everyone that's posted in the past years had a terrible experience with Air France, planes, travel and employees and customer service.

"Extremely Disappointing Experience with Air France (Flight #AF185, HKG to CDG)",Hong Kong,Paris,International,"I recently flew with Air France on flight #185 from Hong Kong to Paris (Nov 10th, 2024), and I am deeply disappointed with the service provided. My experience was marked by a series of issues that left me feeling frustrated and disrespected.

Sky Priority Service at Hong Kong Airport
Despite paying for Sky Priority, the staff at Hong Kong airport made us wait for an unreasonable amount of time without any clear explanation. This was especially frustrating as we had expected expedited service.
Last-Minute Seat Change
In addition to the delays, my seat was changed at the last minute, and it was given to another passenger. This lack of communication and poor handling of seating arrangements added unnecessary stress to the journey.
Discriminatory Treatment on the Plane
During the flight, my group and I experienced what felt like discriminatory treatment, simply because we are Muslims. We were made to feel uncomfortable and unwelcome, which is completely unacceptable.
Halal Meal Quality
Lastly, the halal meal provided was subpar. It was nowhere near the quality of the meals given to other passengers. The meal was not only poorly prepared but also felt like an afterthought. As a paying customer, I expected the same level of attention and care as others on board.
This experience with Air France was incredibly disappointing, and I expect better service from such a reputable airline.

Extremely Disappointing Experience with Air France - Will Never Fly Again,Hong Kong,Paris,International,"I am beyond disappointed with my recent experience with Air France, and I feel compelled to share my frustrations. My family and I booked Economy flex tickets and paid an extra $1400 to choose our seats in advance, only to be given random seating assignments upon boarding. To make matters worse, two of my family members ended up sitting in staff seats, which were not only uncomfortable but also had no screens. How is this acceptable for Premium Economy?

The halal food served was absolutely inedible. It was bland, tasteless, and had no care put into its preparation. To add insult to injury, there was no juice or any beverage accompanying the meal. Meanwhile, other non-Muslim passengers were served well-presented meals. The stark contrast in service was appalling.

But what really broke my heart was the blatant racism my mother and I faced. We were wearing hijabs, and it was clear from the way we were treated that the staff‚Äôs behavior toward us was harsh and discriminatory. It was an uncomfortable, upsetting experience, and we were left feeling unwelcome and targeted simply because of our faith.

This entire trip with Air France was a nightmare, and I will never, under any circumstances, choose this airline again. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it to anyone, especially after such poor service and disrespect. It‚Äôs sad to see such a lack of professionalism and humanity in a global airline.

Beware: Air France‚Äôs Shocking Lack of Customer Support and Enforcement of Basic Seat Assignments!,New York City,Paris,International,"I recently endured one of the worst travel experiences on an Air France flight, and I believe other travelers should be aware of the unacceptable way the airline handled my situation. It wasn‚Äôt about ‚Äúunpleasant smells‚Äù or minor discomforts, as the airline‚Äôs dismissive response suggested‚Äîit was about my assigned seat being taken over by two other passengers, one of whom even laid down in my seat after I was forced to move!

Despite my repeated requests for help, the flight attendant refused to intervene or enforce seating protocol. I had to move to another seat while they completely disregarded my rightful place. This wasn‚Äôt just an inconvenience; it felt like a blatant disregard for my experience as a paying customer.

And when I contacted Air France afterward, hoping they‚Äôd address this serious lapse? Their response was both dismissive and inaccurate. Instead of acknowledging the real problem‚Äîa violation of basic seating rules and lack of crew intervention‚Äîthey responded as if my concern was about a ‚Äúpassenger with strong perfume.‚Äù It was as if they hadn‚Äôt even read my complaint! This kind of indifference to a genuine customer issue is unacceptable and disappointing.

I‚Äôm left wondering: is this how Air France treats all customers, or was my experience ignored because of my background? Either way, I felt humiliated, unheard, and completely disregarded by an airline that claims to prioritize customer satisfaction.

To any potential Air France passengers: think twice before booking with them if you value your comfort, respect, and peace of mind. This was an unacceptable experience, and I hope by sharing it, others can avoid the same treatment.",2024-10,2024-11-12,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
Horrible,Toronto,Paris,International,"Wow!!! What a horrible experience!! I've always flown with Porter and was shocked at how bad Air France is in comparison.

First they have you check in by printing your own boarding pass on a computer, when porter sends you a digital copy. The problem is the computer doesn't even work, so you have to see an attendant (who is busy and irritable).

Then if flying economy, you're squished in a row of 3 to 4 people, the seats are tight and it was the most uncomfortable flight ever.

After eating the tasteless food, my stomach hurt for hours. I was in agonizing pain. When I went to the bathroom one of the flight attendants banged on my door telling me there's turbulence and I need to go back to my seat. So would you rather I throw up all over my seat?? 

I mentioned multiple times to multiple attendants I wasn't feeling good, no one did anything to help.

I asked for a second chamomile tea the second time they came around. The male flight attendant said only have black tea. Since I needed chamomile to sooth my stomach, I gave him my empty cup with the tea bag and asked him for hot water. He yelled out, OMG!! and stormed off. Wtf??

The Worst Flight Experience I‚Äôve Ever Had,Hong Kong,Paris,International,"I spent a fantastic 10-day vacation in Hong Kong with my family, but our return flight with Air France (Flight AF 185) ruined the experience. When we arrived at the check-in counter, we waited over two hours just to receive our boarding passes. Then, only an hour before the flight, they informed us that our pre-selected seats had been changed due to a ""problem."" They assured us the new seats would have extra legroom, though two out of five seats would lack screens. Since we had no other flight options, we reluctantly accepted.

Once we boarded, we discovered our original seats, which had a ‚Äúproblem,‚Äù were sold to other passengers‚Äîeven though we booked the flight three months ago. The new seats were far from an upgrade. Two of them were actually intended for staff, with no screens, no USB ports, and awkwardly positioned in the middle of the aisle‚Äînot ideal for a 13-hour flight. Because of this awkward placement, passengers frequently stepped on my foot whenever they passed by to use the restroom. To make matters worse, a sick passenger sat next to me, and I ended up getting sick as well.

When I raised these issues with a flight attendant, I mentioned that I had paid for Sky Priority to select my seat because this was a long flight and I have sleeping problems. She dismissed my concerns, saying, ‚ÄúYou will get refund,‚Äù and walked away while I was still speaking. The same attendant later bumped into my knee with her drink cart multiple times and even stepped on my foot without apologizing. The food was also terrible; hardly anyone around me finished half of it.

Overall, it was literally the worst flight experience I‚Äôve ever had, and I wouldn‚Äôt recommend Air France. The lack of professionalism, poor seating arrangement, and dismissive treatment from the staff left us deeply disappointed.",2024-11,2024-11-11,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0

Be Mindful of your Carry-On baggage Weight and Size!,Paris,Munich,Europe,Your carry-on luggage/personal item total weight must be less than 26.4lbs. They do weigh your carry on prior to security.

Terrible Customer Service and Duplicate Baggage Charges ‚Äì Avoid Air France!,Kunming,New York City,International,"I recently had a highly disappointing experience with Air France that I feel compelled to share. I booked an international trip through a third-party site, but my e-ticket and booking reference were issued by Air France. My itinerary included three legs:

Kunming to Shanghai (operated by China Eastern Airlines, AF5227/MU9727)
Shanghai to Paris (Air France, AF111)
Paris to New York (Air France, AF111)
Despite being on a single ticket, I was charged twice for the same two pieces of checked baggage‚Äî$270 for the first leg and $240 for the second/third legs. I understand my ticket had zero baggage allowance, but I shouldn't have to pay twice for the same baggage on an international itinerary.

I contacted Air France multiple times for a refund, but their customer service was unhelpful, insisting I contact China Eastern Airlines for the first leg, even though Air France was the ticketing carrier. This is unacceptable. Air France should take responsibility and resolve issues involving their partner airlines, not pass the burden onto their customers.

I also filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Transportation, but to date, I‚Äôve received no resolution from either party. This experience has left me frustrated and significantly out of pocket.

If you value clear policies and responsive customer service, I strongly recommend avoiding Air France. Their lack of accountability has been a nightmare to deal with, and I won‚Äôt be booking with them again.",2024-08,2024-11-08,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0

Avoid AirFrance at all costs.,Paris,Dubai,International,"AirFrance is without doubt the worst airline I have ever flown with. Their customer service team is abysmal. My partner and I flew to Dubai from Paris on the 25th of October 2024, our flight arrive about 3 hours behind schedule and upon arriving at Dubai airport our checked in luggage was nowhere to be seen. I understand baggage goes missing but the baggage did not arrive in Dubai for 72 hours. 

My partner and I were without necessities such as prescribed medication, clothes, and hygiene products for 72 hours. I have since tried to claim expenses for these necessities which equated to roughly ‚Ç¨200-‚Ç¨300 but AirFrance will not process anything without receipts. I have sent the airline screenshots of the purchase orders online and tags of the clothes but our receipts were disposed of in the hotel mistakenly and AirFrance will not acknowledge this. What a farce!

And to top it all off, without the bag for 72 hours in an expensive city like Dubai low and behold the bag arrives with a gaping hole in the side of it. I don't even know how someone would be able to damage a bag like this. It is a hardcase Swissport luggage suitcase. I have been in contact with AirFrance claim for about 7 days now to resolve this and once again, they will not do anything as we have 'no receipts' - How am I supposed to have receipts for a bag that was purchased more than a year ago and has nothing got to do with the damage caused. 

Their customer service team are the most unhelpful group of individuals I have ever dealt with. I would strongly encourage anyone who is contemplating flying with AirFrance to think again in the future. I have taken a serious financial burden from their mishaps and they are doing nothing about it.

OVER RATED AIRLINE & DISRESPECTFUL STAFF TO NON FRENCH PASSENGERS,Raleigh,Paris,International,"OVER RATED AIRLINE- 2/5
As a Million Mile Plus flyer, having traveled to most continents and 50 countries, I find Air France to be BELOW AVERAGE, Mainly because of the way their staff talk down to, about and speak disrespectfully about NON FRENCH passengers.

My Asian wife is Fluent in 5 languages and I am fluent in 3 languages, and both heard staff not only speak disrespectfully and derogatory about me, but many other passengers,  mostly American citizens.

Disgusted,Atlanta,Paris,International,"Staff are incredibly rude.  Had a French staff person call me out of line insisting my carry on bag was too large and absolutely had to be checked at the gate; it was not.  They proceeded to walk away then threatened to change my flight while I was trying to understand what the issue was.  I expressed concerns of checking the bag as it contained medically necessary equipment that I could not risk losing on an extended overseas trip.  They continued to threaten to switch my flight.  They also insisted I switched the bag expressing, "" that's not the bag! You switched it!"".   I ended up having to get an additional bag, barely any smaller, to put my medical equipment in so they could check my original bag.  Obviously, this just meant more space was taken up on the aircraft which made no sense. While navigating this unfortunate experience, I took note that this person was intentionally instigating similar situations with those she interpreted to be American.  When I arrived at my seat, there was a French patron who brought his ""checked"" carry on onboard and placed in the bin I've my seat but staff did not remove it from the overhead bin.  I understand a lot of other nationalities do not care for Americans and expected a certain level of attitude, but I'm honestly blown away by the extreme levels of rudeness and discrimination, especially by staff in a service-based industry.  

The in-flight experience was no better than any domestic US flight.  For an eight hour flight, it was incredibly cramped and the cabin temperature was uncomfortable.  The food was less than unimpressive.  And, as for the staff service on board, it was barely better than the gate service. 

Ultimately, I'm disgusted by this experience and am hoping beyond hope that my return flight with a different airline will be much improved.",2024-11,2024-11-01,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0

Customer Support - Avoidance Tactics,Paris,Toronto,International,"I am incredibly shocked at the level of avoidance tactics by Air France.  After a botched flight for a conference where my baggage arrival was delayed by 2 days, I was entitled to receive compensation in accordance with EU passenger rights.  Air France processed and accepted my claim agreeing to compensate financially as per EU law.  But... the money was never received.  After numerous attempts to contact customer support - complete silence.  Only a response that the case is ""closed"".  Numerous calls to customer support - their response is always the same - the payment will be done shortly.  Its been more than a year since the claim.  No information as to why they did not yet pay out despite written confirmation of their intent to wire compensation on the claim. I proceeded with legal action and their headquarters refuses to receive the notification letter as they need a recipient name in order to accept the letter. But they will not provide the name of any person in either customer support or the legal department.  They are doing anything they possibly can to avoid accountability.  I am amazed at the resilience.  They are playing a game of endurance hoping you will just lose interest or forget about the claim.  There is NOBODY accountable at Air France and they intentionally make it impossible to escalate - no senior manager to talk to - no replies to emails or claim tickets - no support at headquarters .  They violate passenger rights outright and use these tactics to avoid their liabilities.  The only thing left is litigation.  Too bad for the otherwise excellent work of their cabin crews and flight crews.  I am especially fond of KLM.  But in my own case, it is clear that they will not adhere to their responsibilities when things go wrong.  You are no longer a valued customer - just a liability they hope will disappear.

A Good flight,Dubai,Paris,International,"I don't fly a lot on Air France, but took this  Boeing 777-300, from Dubai to Paris. The second leg from Paris to Chicago, AF 0136, was on a Boeing 777-200. Both flights were on time. 

The cleanliness of the aircraft stood out right away, with well-maintained cabins that created a pleasant atmosphere. Each seat was equipped with personal in-flight entertainment screens, offering a variety of movies, TV shows, and music to keep passengers engaged throughout the flight. Additionally, the airline provided complimentary Wi-Fi, though its use was limited to messaging apps like WhatsApp ‚Äî full web browsing was not available.
Air France served a complete meal accompanied by wine, followed by a light snack later in the flight. While the food wasn‚Äôt exceptional, it was decent enough for a long-haul journey.
Boarding for both flights was handled efficiently and smoothly, with courteous and professional staff. The highlight of my experience, however, was the exceptionally affordable fare. After comparing multiple airlines for this route, I found Air France offered the most competitive price, making it a clear winner in terms of value for money.
The layover at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport, however, was less enjoyable. The wait between flights felt quite long, and the airport itself is relatively basic for passengers on extended stopovers, with limited comfortable seating options. Adding to the challenge, the airline unexpectedly changed the terminal for my connecting flight. As a result, I had to go through security screening again. I would strongly advise future passengers to keep a close eye on the departure screens, as the terminal changes can happen without prior notice.
Overall, a pleasant and seamless experience. If you're looking for an affordable yet reliable way to travel from Dubai to Chicago, Air France is certainly a solid option.",2023-11,2024-10-26,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0

The best airlines out there,Panama City,Paris,International,"In my opinion, Air France is the best airline. I've flown with them four times, each time on long-haul flights across the Atlantic, and it has always been a fantastic experience. The entertainment options are great, and the flight crew is both professional and friendly. While the food isn't exceptional, I don't expect Michelin-star quality on an airplane, especially in economy class. They have consistently been on time, often arriving ahead of schedule. I understand that others may have had different experiences or expectations, but after some terrible experiences with other airlines that made me consider avoiding flying altogether, Air France will be my sole choice, regardless of the price. 10/10 from me üá´üá∑‚ù§Ô∏è",2024-10,2024-10-14,5.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

24 hr delay & abusive ground staff in Business Class,London,Johannesburg,International,"Delayed for 24 hrs in Paris due to missed connection travelling from LHR to JNB via CDG in business class.

Upon arrival at Paris CDG, I approached the Customer Service Desk for assistance:
1. The treatment I witnessed towards other passengers was alarming, particularly an elderly man in distress due to Air France‚Äôs staff behaviour. 
2. I was informed that no alternative flights to Johannesburg were available, forcing me to accept a 24-hour delay which caused me serious inconvenience and for which Air France has now denied a claim for compensation including for essential toiletries.

Although I received a voucher for accommodation and meals, the support provided was inadequate especially for a Business Class passenger:
1. I requested on 5 occasions (airside customer service on arrival, baggage service, WhatsApp, land side Sky priority, call centre) for access to my checked baggage containing my Chronic medication (I only had enough in my hand luggage to the scheduled arrival time) which was repeatedly and out right dismissed endangering my health and caused me significant distress. 
2. In spite of being informed by customer service that I could remain in the provided hotel room until 18:00 (as my rebooked flight was scheduled to depart at 21:20) I and other Air France voucher holders was kicked out of the hotel at 11:00. In trying to resolve this situation I experienced disrespect and a lack of empathy from ground staff, including verbal abuse/bullying from one staff member who accused me of being ‚Äúignorant‚Äù.

In spite of raising these concerns the customer service team advised in an email to me that the treatment I received  ‚Äúfully complies with our obligations under the applicable regulations as well as with the commercial policies of our company‚Äù

Never Again Air France,Rome,Port of Spain,International,"This was my first time flying with Air France. Paid 110euros to have my one checked bag sent all the way to my final destination but that was not my worst. I had three flights with Air France before I arrived at home. Took the first to Paris where I had a 15hr layover. Picked up a bug and the Air pressure from flying clogged my ears and never came out. Took the second flight next morning and that made my ear even worse with the air pressure and due to anxiety I became very uneasy, but when u have flight attendants with zero empathy...well instead of deescalating they further added stress to my experience.  My last flight from Panama to Trinidad almost didn't happen because I refused to get on the plane and had to be talked into into it by my companion. Finally I got on, tried hard to be calm eventhough more air pressure built up.in my ear and when I finally got off the plane and got home  had to seek medical treatment for my ear infection.Now I'm not saying they caused my ear infection,  but the customer service was poor and they have no training in calming passengers who need a bit of tlc under stressful situations. 
Now im not one to unpack right away, but when I did, I realized my sun glasses that i loved so much and can never be replaced because there isn't anymore in that style was stolen from my checked bag and replaced with a small plastic duck to add to my displeasure.

Air France - Rude and Rubbish,London,San Jose,International,"Travelled with Air France from Heathrow to Charles de Gaulle then onwards to San Jose in Costa Rica.
The flight out wasn't too bad but noticed a complete lack of customer care from the stewards.  Once departed given a wet towelette and not even offered a drink until a good couple of hours in when had a meal etc.  Not sure where the staff go but seem to disappear!
On the return when arriving at Charles de Gaulle for the flight back to Heathrow which was a connecting flight.  My partner who has a rucksack with camera equipment had to put this through security three times.  The security staff (Securitas) were very rude and basically threw everything out of the rucksack and preceded to x-ray the equipment.  The security area was getting very congested as staff were turning customers bags inside out.  We think the Securitas staff were jobsworth and maybe the fact that had a uniform with a badge on their sleeve made them rude and obnoxious.

Most DISGUSTING RACIST flight I‚Äôve ever been on. DO NOT fly with AF if you‚Äôre Asian,Paris,Shanghai,International,"Here‚Äôs my formal complaint letter:

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing after receiving an unsatisfactory respond to my claim to formally express my extreme dissatisfaction with the service I received during my recent flight with Air France. This has been one of the most dehumanizing and uncomfortable experiences I‚Äôve ever had on a flight. The flight code was AF116, on August 1 and my seat number was 9A. As a loyal customer who has flown with your airline multiple times, I was deeply disappointed by the experience I encountered on this occasion in business class.

Firstly, my service ring was ignored multiple times, while the crew was chatting and walking around, which made me feel overlooked and unvalued as a passenger. Additionally, I was not addressed by name or even welcomed, while seeing other passengers around me being greeted, further contributing to an impersonal experience. One particular stewardess handed out welcome drinks to other passengers while calling them sir or madam and when she came to me, she said nothing and frowned at me. The storage area was difficult to open, its corners were peeling, which is unacceptable for a new plane. I also noticed that my dinner arrived significantly late while others around me and in the same row were served first, leaving me feeling insulted and baffled. The most humiliating and ridiculous thing was that, a stewardess attempted to refill an empty plastic water bottle (that was single use and should have been taken away) without my request, causing a spill that stained my seat and the floor, I was horrified. Despite asking twice for dessert, my request was met with inconsistent responses, and I felt that my needs were not taken seriously. I paid ‚Ç¨38 for Wi-Fi, expecting reliable service, but the connection was disappointingly slow, making streaming impossible. Additionally, I found all crew members to be passive-aggressive with disgusted looks on their faces, and treated other French passengers significantly warmer. During dinner, my tablecloth was carelessly thrown onto my tray by a condescending crew, an action I found to be disrespectful. Upon leaving the aircraft, no one greeted me, which reinforced a feeling of hostility and discrimination throughout my flight. It was also concerning that none of the staff wore name tags, leaving me unable to identify those who contributed to my unfortunate experience. At the lounge, the staff did not extend a welcoming demeanor, simply pointing to machines rather than offering assistance, which they did for other passengers and when I spoked to them, the response was rude. Overall I was treated differently to other passengers and which I deem to be racial discrimination.

Given this series of unsettling events, I am requesting a formal apology from Air France, along with a half refund for the discomfort I experienced during my flight, which is unacceptable even for economy, let alone business class. I have received a very brief response from the China office which I find very dismissive and am not satisfied with. I trust that you value your customers and will take this complaint seriously. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response. (Case number: C-8322415)

Appalling lack of customer service in a travel crisis of THEIR own making. Absolutely shocking.,Tbilisi,Paris,Europe,"I received a text in the early hours (about 2:30) to tell me that my flight was cancelled. I immediately tried to respond to the issue. On the e-mail/text messages, I followed their link that indicated ""to speak with someone from Air France,"" but it led me to a page with no contact information whatever. I then followed another link to find out ""what they are doing to help,"" but it went to a generic page that said they would try to respond to my e-mail (I didn't send them an e-mai) within 24 hours. To date, there's been no response. Without a way to call or find out what they were doing to help their passengers, who were stranded in Tbilisi, I decided to go to the airport to try to speak with someone at the Air France desk (again, this is very early morning now). However, though I found the desk and waited, no Air France staff ever showed up - at all. There was a link on the website (again it's impossible to speak with an actual person) that said if I chose I could request a refund for the full price of the ticket (since Air France cancelled the flight with no explanation). Not knowing what else to do, I pressed the links, and I did get a refund - ‚Ç¨17 that I paid for my seat reservation - NOTHING for the ticket itself. Getting no help from Air France at all, I found a flight going out that day on Turkish Airlines to Paris, via Istanbul, and I had to pay nearly twice what I paid for my original, return flight from Paris to Tbilisi. Upon returning, I have written to Air France twice, including my documentation, requesting a refund for my original ticket (which they said was possible), and comensation for the difference I had to pay to get to Paris somehow. Air France have not responded to either message - I mean not even an acknowledgement that they had received it. To this date (nearly a month later) there has been no contact from them whatever - I could still be stuck in Tbilisi for all they care. The lack of customer service, integrity, and simple human courtesy has been appalling to the point of being shocking.

""I VISITED THIS PLACE""...
... because that was the final leg of my trip schedule of four sections round trip TLV-CDG-IAD-CDG-TLV.  I arrived from IAD and transferred to a plane to TLV.

I had a special meal request and they quickly and efficiently provided that and it was steaming hot and even tasty.

WAS IT WORTH THE COST?
Yes, because I purchased the ticket early

NO BUTTER?!,Paris,San Francisco,International,"I truly thought Air France was something to brag about.  I flew business class from CDG to SFO on 2/5/2024.  I was very excited and only expect the best.  The flight attendant hung my coat.  I drank my champagne and went to sleep.  The food was less than average.  It was very salty and the only thing I can eat is the premade warmed up bread.  But there was no butter, so I ask a male flight attendant for some butter.  It took him a long time to come back to let me know that they dont have any butter.  I don't believe it for a second that they don't have butter!  I cant speak French so I just let it go.

Underwhelming experience,Sao Paulo,Singapore,International,"I was on board on Air France Premium Economy in September 2024, from Brazil to Singapore ( via Paris) and back.

The Crew
Very polite and helpful, however, they dissapear after serving meals. For hours on end,you will not see them

Food and drinks.
What a led down. If you dont want to starve to death,do not use Air France. The food is terrible, and you will not even get a snack on a 11 hour journey. Drinks,you need to stand up and go request them yourself because the crew is nowhere to be found 
I expected more from the premium economy but nothing amazing came out of it.

Premium economy
I am honestly not sure it is worth it.The seats do not recline,even though you get more leg room than economy, but you seat in an upright uncomfortable position, the entire time

No regard for human rights or minorities safety,Paris,London,Europe,"We were in Tunisia travelling as a gay couple and were attacked by locals and even attempted to kill us. So we flew to France earlier than planned as we had a layover in Paris for a week later. Told us over the phone all would be fine as it wasn't our fault and our safety was concerned. When we turn up for our flight that had zero regard for this and charged us 300 euros to board a flight wed already paid for! And told us it was our fault! Punishing us for being attacked for being gay. And if we didn't pay them they'd have gladly stranded us in France on the streets with no food or water. Shocking that a western airline has no regard for minorities or people's safety and that they can charge ridiculous amounts of money for a service that has already been paid for just because we didn't check in at Tunis. Just another way to milk everyone's money, absolutely disgusting airline and now we're left without funds for food for the month and have to go to food banks and they didn't care when we told them this. They also lost our luggage on the way to Tunisia and we had to collect it from the airport the next day at our own expense. And we weren't even contacted to confirm it had definitely arrived at the airport. Never travelling with this evil, twisted airline again

Air France lost my baggage on 9/28 when I flew from RDU to Paris to Seville for vacation. It's 1923 on 10/1 and I still don't have my luggage.

Do NOT Fly on AIR FRANCE!!!,Detroit,Valencia,International,"I booked a flight on Delta Airlines for my wife, me, and our dog to Valencia, Spain on Delta. They put us on 2 Air France flights and the trip was a disaster. Here's why,

1) The original flight had a 1 hour and 20 minute layover at CDG, which our friends told us was likely not enough time because we'd have to go through customs and security AGAIN, with a dog, and take a BUS from one terminal to another.¬†

2) Delta notified me via the Delta app that the flight would be delayed and we'd have even less time to make the change. So, I went to the Delta special assist counter at DTW and the representative said she couldn't just change the flight from CDG to VLC, she'd have to entirely cancel and rebook both tickets. She proceeded to do that, wrote the new gate numbers on the boarding pass, and gave them to me.

3) The original flight left around 6:30 PM and we arrived at the airport around 4:00 PM. The new flight was for 9:00 PM. Around 7:00, I noticed the Delta assist agent had rebooked my wife's ticket but NOT MINE!¬†

4) I went to the Delta assistant near our gate and was told my ticket had been CANCELED because I was not on the 6:30 flight and there was nothing they could do because it was on Air France.

5) My ticket was ultimately rebooked and we made the 9:00 PM flight.

6) On the Air France flight, the video screen at my seat stopped working, so I watched NOTHING for the duration. I tried using the WiFi, which also DIDN'T WORK!

7) We landed at CDG and were glad we changed the flight because we definitely would have missed that connection.

8) When we got to VLC, my bag arrived fine but my wife's bag was LOST! I kinda expected mine to be lost but NOT my wife's!

9) We waited in line for OVER AN HOUR to report the missing bag. 

10) The lost luggage agent told me the bag had been left at CDG, would be on the next flight to VLC, and would be delivered the same day to the apartment we were staying at.

11) THE BAG WAS NOT DELIVERED THE SAME DAY! THE BAG WAS NOT DELIVERED AT ALL!! THERE WAS NO CALL OR EMAIL!!! NO COMMUNICATION WHATSOEVER!!!!

12) The next day, 9/7, I started calling and messaging Delta and Air France. Delta told me it was an Air France problem. AIR FRANCE SAID NOTHING BECAUSE THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS CLOSED FOR THE DAY! CLOSED!!! ON A FRIDAY!!!!

13) I spent the ENTIRE first day of my vacation trying to retrieve a bag I PUT IN YOUR CARE!¬†

14) My wife and I took more HOURS FROM OUR VACATION to return to VLC in hopes of retrieving the bag.

15) The bag was there.

16) I had a chance to talk to the Air France workers in VLC and they told me there was NO MANAGER working there. EVER! They only have a ticket counter supervisor. All the baggage problems were being handled by a CONTRACTOR!

17) The CONTRACTOR had ONE PERSON working to handle all the lost bags and there were 10 people ahead of us when we got in line. When flights arrived, more people showed up and the new arrivals took priority over US!

I will NEVER fly on Air France again and I will NOT allow Delta to book me on one of their flights.

Unable to Process Refund Due to Website Bugs ‚Äì Extremely Disappointed,Berlin,Paris,Europe,"I am writing to express my extreme frustration with the lack of functionality on Air France's website. For weeks now, I have been trying to process a refund for my booking (reference number: RDIUQ6, under the name Kolbe), and every time I attempt to access the refund page or use other necessary features, I encounter consistent bugs and errors. This is unacceptable, as it has significantly delayed the processing of my refund and has caused me unnecessary stress.

Despite trying multiple times and across different devices and browsers, the website simply does not work as intended. I have also tried to reach out to customer service for assistance, but have received no effective help. It's clear that Air France's needs to address these technical issues promptly, but more importantly, I need my refund to be processed immediately without further delay.

This experience has left me deeply disappointed with Air France, and I am now forced to resort to public complaints to get the attention this matter deserves. I expect swift action and my refund processed as soon as possible.

I look forward to a response and a solution to this unacceptable situation. If I do not receive the refund or an appropriate response soon, I will consider escalating this issue further.

While we managed to secure one night in a hotel, our infant had to endure the discomfort of the airport. This was an experience we would never wish upon anyone, especially with no meals or funds available. The lack of basic human decency and courtesy was shocking, and despite our pleas for compensation, we were met with rudeness and hostility. Ultimately, we had to rely on Delta to rebook our flights, as Air France staff refused to assist us.

Air France has poor reservation system and very understaffed airport counter in Paris CDG airport.aris.,Paris,San Francisco,International,"We recently flew Air France between San Francisco to Paris. Our trip from SF to Paris went smoothly. The seats were very comfortable. The meals were fine, and the service was very good. On our way back from Paris to SFO, our flight was on Sep 18.  When we checked in online 24 hours before the flight, we found that our seats has been changed even though we had to pay extra and made our reservations at least six months ago.  My husbands and I were randomly assigned to seats in two different rows. We called Air France right away, the person on the line was helpful and told us that he saw our original seat assignments in the system, but he wasn't sure why the seats on our electronic boarding passes showed differently. He further reassured us everything was fine by sending us a confirmation notice that our seat assignment were the ones that we chose. 
On Sep 18, we arrived at the airport about 2.5 hours before departure. When we found the counters, there were at least six people ahead of us and there was only one staff at the counter! Can you imagine, one person at the counter serving all economy passengers in Air France's country?? After 15 minutes wait, I ran to a staff who was helping passengers to print bagging tags to see if he could help us as he was free. When he found out that we were in Premium Economy, he said that we should have gone to a different isle which is a long walk away. We decided to wait, finally it was out turn. I explained to her of what happened, she told us she could see our original seat assignments, but she couldn't understand why it has been changed. Our seats were already assigned to other people, she had to give us different seats. With little time left before boarding, we had to take the only option. Our assessment is that someone with authority gave our seats to 'friends and family'. They didn't do anything to compensate, all they said was they didn't understand how that happened. I think they should have given us some kind of vouchers for future travel or free upgrade, but they didn't.
 
Here is the my rating for Air France:
Service on the plane : very good, 5/5
Seats in premium economy: very comfortable, 4.5/5
Food: 3.5/5, quite good, but nothing special.
Snacks between meals: They offered sandwiches, cookies, buts, chocolate and ice cream, 5/5.
Reservation system: 0.5/5 !
Staffs at Paris CDG airport: 1/5 as they were very understaffed.

They broke my luggage and yet they did not want to pay for the damage, claiming that I did not have the receipt for the luggage. But who keeps the receipts for our purchases? Nobody, right? So I am here to warn you that if you do not want to get angry, do not travel with them.

The plane was delayed, we sat on the plane for 1 hour and 15 minutes and the staff didn't explain why the flight is delayed. I have a connecting flight in Paris and by the time we landed the gate already closed. The staff onboard couldn't answer anything about the connecting flight just saying they don't know. They made me stay over night and the way to the layover hotel was really messy and unorganised with the shuttle buses in Paris. When I came back the next morning at the security gate the weighted the carry on which was 11 kg but the combined weight with my handbag was 13 kg and it couldn't be more than 12kg so they made me check-in my carry on.

On boarding we observe that all 2-seat rows are occupied by 1 man/1 woman. I am seated next to a very overweight man.  There is a personal reason why I booked early and reserved our seats which is personal and anxiety related.  Air France stated seats are changed for safety, security or organization yet have no explanation as to why our seats were given to a couple.

Dirty planes and rude flight attendants mixed with kicking kids,Marrakech,Paris,International,"I had a terrible experience on the flight from Marrakech to Paris with Babies sitting in front, next and behind me. I usually travel in planes with kids zones so those without kids can travel in peace. However, the kid behind me constantly kicked my seat, one time I even spilled my drink because of it. I asked to be seated elsewhere but was just told the plane is full and kids are like that. I thought the reply from the flight attentendant was rude as there could have been an easy solution as the father of the kicking child was sitting next to his wife and the passenger next to me with the baby thought it was normal that kids kick, so if the passengers behind me had swaped seats we all could have been happy, but my concerns were completely dismissed. 
While I can appreciate that these sorts of experiences are somewhat subjective, the flight to Frankfurt from Paris was even worse as the plane was completely dirty - the ventilation areas had black spots that returned a wet wipe black and next to the seats were week old crumbs and dirt. I asked for help with more wipes but had to wait for the wipes for almost the entire duration of the flight. The flight attendant was also quite unfriendly about the issue saying it was not her job to clean the plane - well as a passenger it certainly is not my job either, it is actually a health hazard for me as I suffer from mold and dust allergies.",2024-09,2024-09-14,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0

"Forced To Sit Next To A Vomiting/Coughing  Passenger (Yes, There Were Other Seats Available)",Zanzibar Island,Paris,International,"I recently flew from Zanzibar to Paris in July 2024, and it was by far the worst international flight experience I‚Äôve ever had. I was forced to sit next to a passenger who continuously vomited into a bag and coughed on me throughout the flight. I requested several times to have my seat moved but was told the plane was full. After takeoff, I noticed multiple empty seats, and some passengers were able to stretch out and sleep comfortably. I, however, was still forced to stay in my seat next to the sick passenger.

When I asked the flight attendant again after takeoff about changing my seat, she spoke in French to another attendant and a passenger near the bathroom, completely ignoring me. To make matters worse, the sick passenger's mother got up to dispose of the vomit bags, confirming she was seated next to me. They never came to sanitize the area or move me, leaving me in an unsanitary and uncomfortable situation for the entire 8.5-hour flight.

As an educator traveling internationally for both business and leisure, I didn‚Äôt want to cause a scene, especially being a Black traveler in a situation where we often face unfair treatment. It‚Äôs disheartening to feel like I had no option but to endure this, knowing how things could escalate unjustly.

After the flight, I emailed Air France, and after weeks of waiting, they responded with an insulting $100 voucher that wasn‚Äôt even valid, and they never followed up with a call or proper discussion.

I do not recommend flying with Air France. It‚Äôs disappointing to see Delta partnered with them, leaving me with little choice when traveling internationally.

Awful Business class experience never again,Bangkok,Paris,International,"My partner and I visited Bangkok, departing from Manchester via Amsterdam with KLM. On the outbound journey, we booked premium economy with KLM. The service was so good that we decided it was likely to be similar with Air France, so we opted to upgrade to business class for the return leg.

Regrettably, our assumption that the service would match KLM‚Äôs standard couldn‚Äôt have been further from the truth. Contrary to what was stated on the Air France website, the 777 we flew on still had the old business class seats. The seats were not clean, and I had to use Dettol to wipe everything down myself. Additionally, the seats appeared worn and in poor condition. I find it extremely unfair that Air France has essentially created a lottery regarding which aircraft have been refitted and which haven‚Äôt, while still charging the same fare.

We decided to make the most of the situation and relax with a movie, but even that wasn‚Äôt possible. The entertainment system froze repeatedly, making it impossible to watch films or listen to audio.

After lunch, I didn‚Äôt see a flight attendant in the business class cabin for several hours. Unlike the KLM flight where constant refreshments were offered in premium economy, no such service was provided by Air France. When we did ask, the older male flight attendant seemed visibly frustrated by the request, which made us feel like a nuisance. Despite pressing the call bell, the flight attendants either didn‚Äôt come, walked straight past, or took 20 minutes to respond, only after being flagged down. We spent the entire flight thirsty. I later found the flight attendants sitting around, laughing in the mid-galley with the curtains drawn. Eventually, I was told I could help myself to a banana and an orange from the forward galley and pour my own water. From that point on, it felt like the business class cabin was practically abandoned, with passengers getting up and helping themselves.

When dinner was finally served, it was rushed due to turbulence. The meal was basic, accompanied by warm, flat Coke, and no alcohol was offered. The reason given was that the turbulence didn‚Äôt allow enough time to serve drinks, but I don‚Äôt buy into that. From my knowledge of aviation, pilots would have been warned about the turbulence through TAF reports and ride reports from other pilots.

In conclusion, it‚Äôs a real shame that KLM has partnered with Air France, as I will now avoid booking with either airline in the future. I refuse to pay for business class tickets when the service is better in economy.

Perhaps when Air France completes its cabin refresh and starts caring about its passengers again, I might reconsider. Until then, I‚Äôll stick with Emirates.",2024-09,2024-09-08,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0

Horror show,Boston,Nairobi,International,"We booked on Delta.  Air France flew the second leg of the flight from Paris to Nairobi.  They were a horror show.  The plane experienced mechanical issues as it was taxiing out to the runway.  Instead of deplaning, Air France kept us on the plane on the tarmac for over 2 hours before deciding that the plane could not be used.  They scheduled a new flight four hours later.  We then deplaned with the promise of a free lunch on Air France and were told that the restaurant food services would be informed and we had to do nothing else.  Not so.  We had to wait in line for a voucher.  Some people found this out only after they had eaten their meals and could not be reimbursed.

We were given incorrect instructions as to where to go to find out about rebooking and accommodations.  We and the other exhausted passengers walked about the airport until some kind sole told us where to go.  Air France put us up in a residential building without a restaurant on premises or nearby.  We had to walk nearly a mile in the airport to reach the shuttle to the building.  They gave us a bagged dinner that consisted of a premade sandwich, a juice box and some non-descript pastry.  Welcome to France.  They rebooked us through Dubai (instead of a direct flight) on an African airline two days later, claiming that this was the earliest that we would be able to reach Nairobi.

Avoid Air France and KLM at All Costs,Marrakech,New York City,International,"My journey began on June 28th, a seemingly ordinary day until my baggage vanished into the labyrinth of airline logistics. My flight from Marrakech, Morocco, to New York marked the start of a frustrating ordeal that would test my patience and resilience.

Upon arrival, I discovered my luggage was nowhere to be found. I immediately filed a claim at JFK Terminal 1, obtaining a claim number and a phone number to call. Despite repeated attempts, I was unable to reach anyone by phone. Frustrated, I even took  cabs to the airport multiple times in hopes of getting answers, but there was no trace of my baggage.

Despite repeated attempts to contact Air France and KLM customer service, I received little to no assistance. The initial shock soon turned into a mounting sense of frustration as days turned into weeks with no sign of my belongings.

As time passed, my anxiety grew. My suitcase contained essential items, including toiletries, clothing, and valuable electronics. Without my belongings, I felt stranded and unable to fully enjoy my trip.

After a staggering 56 days of waiting, I finally retrieved my baggage upon my return to Marrakech on August 22nd. However, upon inspection, I was appalled to discover that the suitcase had been significantly damaged. The contents were scattered. I was dismayed to discover that the airline had gone through the contents of my suitcase without my consent. They had merely needed to match the bag tag, a task that could have been easily accomplished without violating my privacy.

The airline's violation of its own policy regarding lost baggage (after 45 days), coupled with their lack of urgency and evasive tactics, have left me feeling frustrated and disrespected. I believe their primary concern was to avoid responsibility rather than resolve my issue. Their handling of delayed baggage claims is unacceptable, and I have no confidence in their ability to provide adequate customer service.",2024-06,2024-09-04,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

"Poor aircraft cleanliness, broken facilities and lack of customer engagement.",Paris,Abu Dhabi,International,"Find an alternative carrier. Returning to Abu Dhabi from a vacation in Europe and decided to use Air France as their schedule best suited our plans, NEVER AGAIN. 
As this is approximately a 7 hour flight we paid an additional premium for extra leg room seats (16A-16B), however, on boarding we found 16B was both damp and dirty with food waste still evident on and around the seat. This was pointed out to the cabin crew who provided some wet wipes for me to clean the seat myself, stating they would come and look once they had time (which never happened). I sat on the night blanket for the duration of the flight as a barrier to avoid sitting in the damp portion of the seat!!!
The whole row area 16A -16C had clearly not been cleaned to any standard (as can be seen by provided photos).
When the meal service arrived we found the in built table was also broken (photo provided) on seat 16A and would not support the tray of food or drink, which necessitated a balancing act to eat!! Again this was pointed out to the crew at the time. 
The whole aircraft appeared worn and dirty and the two toilets which we used were a test of our smell tolerances, as they had an overpowering smell of urine.
We raised an official complaint to AF requesting a refund of only the additional charges that had been levied for these seats due to their condition. This was dismissed by what appeared to be an auto generated response (AI)..! 
We are frequent flyers taking on average 15 flights a year using many different airlines, however, the standard onboard AF was well below what we would expect on other airlines especially Middle Eastern airlines.

Absolute Madness!!!,Seattle,Paris,International,"Me, my grandparents, aunt and uncle were all supposed to go on a cruise from Barcelona. We had a flight from Seattle to Paris and a connection flight from Paris to Barcelona. When we first got on the flight from Seattle to Paris they had us waiting at the terminal for over an hour, and due to the disorganized traffic and badly managed policies at SeaTac and Air France‚Äôs crew, we missed our connection flight from Paris to Barcelona by 5 minutes. Exhausted after running around the whole airport, which we  were told by one of the flight attendants that it was going to be a ‚Äúshort‚Äù walk. When we found the Air France service counter, and when we spoke to the people there, they treated us like absolute nothing- not understanding that the customers‚Äô satisfaction needs to go first. I personally can‚Äôt believe that these people even HAD! the audacity to treat us this way and how they were showing their true colors was just so upsetting and nerve-racking to see. We also asked to speak to the manager MULTIPLE! times and that so called ‚Äúmanager‚Äù never ended up coming. They offered to get us tickets to Barcelona later in the day and unfortunately the cruise ship would have already left by the time we have arrived, and they acted so surprised and showed no remorse to us. We asked if they can find us a flight to the cruise‚Äôs first stop in Seville, and they said that we would have to pay ‚Ç¨1357 PER PERSON!!! We told them that since it was their fault that we missed our connecting flight and that THEY! were the ones that had to pay for the ‚Äúdamages‚Äù and they basically gave us the ‚Äúmiddle finger‚Äù and sent us on our way. We eventually were able to rebook 2 more flights one from Paris to Barcelona and the other one from Barcelona to Seville, and due to all of this mishap we lost 2 days of our cruise.

The airline staff need to have training again, about how to talk with customer. I believe Air France is hiring uneducated people to work in their company.

On way back, FCO-CDG, we were well aware of the weight restrictions so we threw out some things to accommodate a few small trinkets we bought.

How hard is it to let me know when I check in that I will have to check my carry on.

Air France Nearly got 100% from me,Birmingham,Ottawa,International,"Flew to Ottawa Canada via Paris and returned yesterday. After an early start in Birmingham flying with Air France subsidiary Hop, I had an intended layover of four hours in Paris for my connecting flight. Unfortunately the A350 aircraft had a technical problem that took 3 hours to fix but we were given a ‚Ç¨11 voucher for  food and drink. Once on the aircraft we were soon airborne and the rest of the flight went very smoothly. The economy meal was very nice, although I am still getting used to Paper, card and wooden cutlery being used for meals ( I've not flown for a long time). Crew were very pleasant and in flight entertainment was enjoyable.

I was happy with checking in a getting boarding pass before flying although I had it on my phone the agent suggested having a printed copy in case my phone battery died.

Coming home the flight was on time and got into Paris early, ( which was of no use to me as I had a three hour layover). My only complaints for the journey home was 1. The meat choice of meal was finished so I had to endure vegan food. Surely they should have vegetarian food as an option for those passengers that wish to self abuse themselves and have meat as default. As a Obligate carnivore I was quite upset by this arrangement.

My second complaint was about a flight attendant who was clumsy when handing me my hot coffee in a small paper cup. He spilled it over my white trousers leaving a horrible stain. After complaining to the cabin manager I was offered ‚Ç¨15 for cleaning or 2700 air miles. I accepted the latter as I plan to fly AF again sometime in the future.

I would also have purchased a ticket (on Air France) from London to Paris for that reason. 

They best solution: Basically they wanted me to pay EUR 700 to make that change, despite vacatingn an extra seat from Rome to Paris they could use to sell (the flight was packed) and despite the fact that I would be purchasing another ticket on Air France from London to Paris. Pretty unreasonable. And over the phone I got hung up on when they ran out of answers to my solicitations. 

So basically I had to leave one day earlier for Rome and spend the night there to take the early morning flight to Paris bound for Sao Paulo.

AF customer service consisted of  impenetrable layers of recorded messages, robots and other artificial intelligence that provided no useful information or guidance and did not even understand questions. AF personnel (when they answered)  read from bullet points and said ‚Äúthe information is in the computer system,‚Äù when it was not. No AF rep made any effort to to help  or even apologize.  They all lacked authority to do anything.  It was always the responsibility of ""some other office"" that did not seem to exist. .Although AF said they would reimburse expenses with receipts, AF reimbursed only 40% of the receipts. AF gave no explanation. Very Orwellian experience.",2024-04,2024-08-18,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0
Zero customer service,Los Angeles,Paris,International,"Air France ticketing policies are unclear at best.  After booking a refundable & changeable business class ticket for November, I changed the outbound to one day prior.  Somehow, this resulted in the ticket becoming non-refundable and possibly not changeable.  I immediately contacted customer service who are unable to resolve this issue.  Their policy appears to be that once you make a change, the ticket is no longer refundable even within 24 hours.  It is not possible for them to transfer a call to a supervisor.  I was told to file a claim.  Air France has become similar to a criminal organization.  They charge your credit card and then you are stuck with whatever was booked.  They must be violating US Dept of Transportation laws.

Domage,Atlanta,Paris,International,"After 40 years as your customer travelling between Atlanta and Paris, Paris and Casablanca, New York and Paris...I have finally decided to never again be in of your fleet. I am tired of your staff orgueilleuse attitude, their down look at me, the food is not up to par and skimpy served very poorly by the same staff attitude, but broke the camel's back on this last trip from ATL to CDG was how close the economy seats are so uncomfortable. You advertise free wifi but this is a lie, even for texting. 
As I was waiting to use the restroom I saw cookies on top of the counter, I asked the attendant if I could have one cookie so not faint she said: ""d√©sol√©e monsieur mais ces cookies sont un cadeau pour l'√©quipage"". She said it with a stern face as though she was punishing a misbehaved child, not at all friendly, she made me feel bad, now I know how a beggar must feel when met with a person like her. I am very polite Rotarian, I smiled and went on to the restroom. Doesn't Air France train its staff to be hospitable? Or at least friendly in their negative response? This same thing we notice when waiting in line to board, your staff act like seargents almost screaming at yours and their customers. I could go on and on but I think you get the picture. You Air France are not at Delta airlines caliber and yet they let you be part of the Sky Team,  I would suggest train at least your attendants at Delta's facilities, Delta's service,  hospitality and may I add generosity never disappointed me, they are the best. At their ticket counter you are welcomed with smiles and help and warm hello how is your day, they forgive you if you have 3 pounds over the weight limit, you feel better after checking in, that's important if you are nervous about flying. Be happy that it is Delta ticket counter staff who checking in your passengers, (customers).
I am sharing this review with Delta. And by the way you'd pay a consultant a fee to report to you what I just did for free, You are welcome.

"Fun with traveling on commercial airlinea, take the train, bus, boat or car! or bicycle",Nantes,Milan,Europe,"I and another in our group were denied boarding at gate on a connecting Air France flight, while some others on our late flight and others in our group traveling with us on the late flight were let on plane. Reason given to us was that our luggage was not on plane (turned out none of our groups' luggage was on plane and we suspect the true reason was the plane was overbooked). All of our group except for us had booked through a travel agent (which allows for a group claim for compensation and possible bad review from the professional travel agency people) and did arrive late at CDG Paris, but the pilot had announced that they were holding the connecting flight open for us. When we requested help at counter, they were helpful to a degree (gave us vouchers for hotel, which said we were denied boarding because we arrived at gate after gate had closed), they informed us that we would be provided with flight the next morning, and an overnight stay (which was the case, we just had to get up at 5:00am to do that after getting to hotel room around 1am). We were given unclear instructions on how/where to catch a bus (outside with bus N1 ) and get to our hotel and were (along with about 75 others from our Air France flight and other Air France flights) looking for bus location when we were confronted by officially dressed airport personnel (scammers as it turned out) outside trying tell us all hotel precinct buses had stopped running for the night and they would provide taxi (for an undisclosed price). 
 When requesting compensation help from AirHelp they didn't want to pursue it, most likely since it was not a straight forward overbooking. I'll try Air France and my travel insurance next (the other person bumped with me did get some  compensation from her travel insurance).
 I suspect the who thing was an organized scam by some Air France middle management and gate personnel to get their palms greased by the beneficiaries of the massive number of people 'missing' there flights, taxi companies involved, hotel establishments involved, to the detriment of Air France financially and reputationally and displaced passengers. I know I will avoid Air France until I hear they have sufficiently dealt with the practice. On top of that when the checked suitcase did arrive in Milan it was still unzipped partially, I suspect by someone that had gone through it to find valuables/pawning items (luckily there were none). CDG is high on the places lost baggage happens), so I would recommend avoiding that airport, if you have checked baggage.",2024-07,2024-08-14,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

He threatened us that we would be missing our flight, and we can wait till everyone is done boarding the flight. When we asked why we are getting held behind when everyone else in the line behind us are getting to board the flight without any issue. He then told us to "" stop acting like north Koreans"". We told him to look at our passport and that we are not north Korean. He said, "" I don't care"" His coworkers even came to talk to him to let us go but he said no. I then demanded to speak to supervisor upon which his response was"" wait till the end then""   The situation was absolutely ridiculous and i had to yell to finally get attention from the Supervisor. The supervisor however was godsent, kind and compassionate lady. She listened to us and apologized on his Behalf. I asked her to get me his name, as i was going to complain about this situation but I was told none to the staff have name badges on them including herself.

As we were landing in Paris the plane bounced to on side of the runway and then the other (as if the approach seemed to be too fast)  jolting people in there seats.

Worst Service Possible,Cincinnati,Edinburgh,International,"I flew from Cincinnati, OH to Edinburgh, Scotland on June 28-29, 2024. I had a short layover in Paris and was on an Air France flight from Paris to Edinburgh. When I arrived in Edinburgh my luggage and golf clubs were not there. Trying to get an answer from the baggage attendant for Air France in Edinburgh was like talking to a wall. I finally completed the online baggage claim. Since I literally had only the clothes on my back I spent most of my first 2 days in Edinburgh trying to find and buy clothes, etc. After several calls to AF customer service on June 30 I was finally informed my golf clubs were in Edinburgh and would be delivered that day but my luggage was still lost. We were leaving Edinburgh for St Andrews on July 1 and I gave AF my travel information, motels, etc. I was very prudent in most purchases but I was playing golf at St Andrews and I wasn‚Äôt playing in a ¬£10 shirt. I returned home on July 10 without my luggage and spent $1,684 on clothes, toiletries, laundry service and a new piece of luggage (after traveling 4 days using shopping bags). I filed a delayed baggage claim for $1,684 on July 10. On July 22 I filed a lost baggage claim to replace everything I had lost but I did deduct amounts for some of my delayed baggage claim. My luggage actually showed in Cincinnati on July 23 so I dropped the lost baggage claim. AF has finally offered me $1,384 after I had to jump through hoops supplying an overkill of documents. They can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt tell me how they reached the amount of their offer vs my request. I learned from the abundance of tags on my luggage that it was in Edinburgh on June 30 and was marked unclaimed and returned to Paris on July 2 and finally sent to Cincinnati on July 23. I spooked to AF on the phone everyday and asked about my luggage but all I heard was it was still lost but the actual bag tags tell a different story. No one at AF will take credit for this calamity. I have also been informed that it may be 60 days I actually get my money. I wish I could fly somewhere and pay 60 days after the flight.

Air France doesn‚Äôt care about its clients,Paris,Tokyo,International,"I had to make two reservations for my family for our trip to Tokyo because I had to pay with two different cards. I reserved in premium economy and only shortly before the trip did I realize that Air France had made an error on one of the reservations, putting part of my family in economy. I called Air France to try to solve this problem and they turned a deaf ear on my request. The only solution that they proposed for this error in their system was that I pay almost double what I had paid for my premium economy seats  to have my economy seats upgraded so my family could travel together. I spent more than five or six hours on the telephone with various agents of Air France trying to find a solution. I asked to be connected with the superior and all of them refused. I asked for an email that I could contact someone to listen to  my case and no one would provide me one. Except the last lady to whom I spoke,  who gave me an email, to which I wrote. I was surprised that Air France responded by having somebody telephone me. But this person accused me of the error and not Air France and again only proposed that I pay this time almost 3 times the original price for premium economy to have my two other members of the family join me so we could travel together.  Not only was there no effort to find a solution but Air France accused me of the problem. I was scandalized by the by the argumentative tone of the agent who called to tell me, there was nothing he could do. He tried to put all of the blame on me again, which I found counterproductive. I wish he just have never called me because it would‚Äôve saved me time. It was very disappointing to think that the company had no interest in trying to repair what is meant to be a special moment for a family to make a long trip from Paris to Tokyo. The feeling I got was that they did not care in the least. In my opinion, I would say that Air France is OK more or less if there is not a problem. But if there is one they don‚Äôt care about it.

Never to Air France in future,Bengaluru,Toronto,International,"I had a very disappointing experience with Air France. My flight from Bangalore to Toronto included a layover in Paris, but a 6-hour delay departing Bangalore caused me to miss my connecting flight. The next available flight wasn't for another 24 hours. The way Air France treated their passengers was extremely poor; the sleeping arrangements provided looked like a mortuary, as shown in the photos. They also only gave ‚Ç¨15 for three meals, which is utterly inadequate. I never expected such poor hospitality from the airline.

Air France - The worst experience !,Birmingham,Paris,Europe,"Horrendous experience, as Air France did not issue myself and several other passengers with Boarding Passes for our connecting flight to Malta.
We were all denied boarding, waiting over 11 hours for the next available flight.
The Air France staff at CdG Airport were terrible too, they didn‚Äôt even compensate us with any food/drink vouchers, left us with no compensation (as yet) for the flight refusal to board through no fault of our own.
All of this, despite me having downloaded the app and pleading with staff to allow me to board.
To make it even worse, the flight departed almost half an hour late, in which time the staff could so easily have resolved the situation.
I would NEVER recommend anyone to book or fly with Air France.
They have done nothing to resolve my claim for compensation to date.",2024-06,2024-08-04,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,1.0,3.0819906910132473
Air France cheating on refunds,Bordeaux,Helsinki,Europe,I was flying to Helsinki from Bordeaux. The flight was full and I was not allowed to onboard.

Disappointing After A Lot Of Hype,Paris,St Martin / St Maarten,International,"As Air France‚Äôs business class seemed to have received a lot of praise recently on various forum that I read,  I thought it was time to give them a chance to St Maarten on our latest trip to St Barths, especially after a poor experience on BA via Antigua last year. Mrs Fatbear is recovering from a hip operation but can get around with the use of a walking stick, so we didn‚Äôt envisage any problems getting through Paris CDG.

Our flight from London to CDG was pretty decent. We landed at the K gates in terminal 2E and our connecting flight to St Maarten was also departing from a K gate. However, it was a long traipse to the security area, where it was chaotic, but I eventually found someone to advise where the Priority Lane was, as this was not visible from the entrance to the security area, maybe due to the masses of people there.

New security machines had been introduced so that only liquids had to be taken out of our bags, all electronic devices could remain where they were. The journey from disembarking our arriving flight to clearing security took 30 minutes, and already the board was showing that our flight to St Maarten was boarding so we didn‚Äôt have time to visit the AF business lounge.

The departure lounge resembled a zoo, and we had a long walk to the gate, which required going down a level, and with the escalator broken, we took a lift. Our aircraft was on a remote stand so a bus was needed to get to it. The bus was crammed packed and gave us a tour of most of the airfield before we were deposited at the second furthest plane from terminal 2E.

Climbing the stairs to the aircraft was difficult for Mrs Fatbear, and I had to carry all of our hand luggage.

The A330 has a 2-2-2 configuration in Business Class but didn‚Äôt seem to have any more cabin space that the 2-4-2 on BA‚Äôs 777s.

The seat had a really annoying over the shoulder seat belt with hardly any length to the buckle and there was a noticeable lack of storage space around the seats. Although it converts to a lie flat bed, the area for your feet is very narrow and goes under the seat in front. The shared armrest between the two aisle seats is also very narrow and not suitable for placing anything on except perhaps an elbow.

A standard amenity kit with the usual offerings was provided, and champagne, orange juice or water were given out prior to take-off.

Like in London, there was a problem with a passenger no-show so yet again, we took-off 50 minutes behind schedule but were still expected to arrive on time.

A very nice-looking menu booklet was handed out and our main meal order was taken shortly after departure. Drinks were served around 30 minutes after take-off with the food starting to arrive just under an hour into the flight. 

I didn‚Äôt want the starters but was given it anyway, and it wasn‚Äôt particularly nice. The main chicken and gnocchi course was OK though, and some French mustard was offered to go with it so at least there was a bit of flavour, as it would have been pretty bland without this.

Midway through the flight one of the cabin crew asked if we would put down both of our window blinds as some passengers wanedt to get some sleep. Seeing this was a day flight, I am puzzled why airlines insist on this, especially as the amenity kit includes eye shades for those who want to sleep. I‚Äôm not sure why they bother to include them. 

As I wanted to read we kept one of the blinds open rather than put a light on. When I went to the toilet soon after, I noticed about two thirds of the cabin were awake watching the inflight entertainment rather than sleeping. 

The toilet, situated between rows 4 and 5 was the largest I have ever come across on an aircraft. Even the very large people in the US show 600 Pounders would not have any problems using the facility ! 

WiFi was available but it wasn‚Äôt free, costing ‚Ç¨10 for one hour or ‚Ç¨22 for the whole flight. I didn‚Äôt bother with it.

Just over an hour before landing more food was served. The main item was a brioche cut in half with a filler which was mostly goat‚Äôs cheese. Again, it wasn‚Äôt great. I didn‚Äôt eat the grapefruit salad, but Mrs Fatbear said it was the only nice thing she had eaten on both our flights. There was also a finger shaped piece of sponge cake which was pretty tasteless.

Our arrival at St Maarten was on time despite the late departure. Juliana Airport was ravaged by hurricane Irma in 2017 and still hasn‚Äôt been fully renovated. However, the four parking fingers to the terminal are again operational and three aircraft were already attached to the terminal as we taxied. Unfortunately, the A330 parked at the gate but wasn‚Äôt connected to the terminal. Instead, we had to go down some steps before boarding another packed bus, which took what seemed to be 10 minutes to travel the 400 metres to the arrivals area.

Finding some positives, the AF flight attendants were very friendly but surprisingly the food was terrible. Next time we will go back to BA via Antigua.",2024-06,2024-08-03,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.4978647686832742,1.0,2.0
Decent Business Class Flight,London,Paris,Europe,"During the on-line check-in I had to scan our passports to be uploaded to our reservation. It worked first time for Mrs Fatbear‚Äôs passport but took five attempts for mine before it was successful. This turned out to be a waste of time as we had to show our passports at the gate anyway.

The boarding pass recommended arriving at T4 at 03.45 for a 06.15 departure. Nothing was open when we arrived at T4 at 04.15 except some check-in desks. Security did not open until 04.30 but not the fast-track, so this was one privilege of business class not available. 

The last time I flew Air France from T4, admittedly pre-Covid, Sky Team had a lounge but this has now been taken over by Etihad. None of the information screens in the departure lounge made reference to Air France/KLM having access at any of the lounges in T4, although I have subsequently learnt that the Plaza Premium Lounge is available for AF business passengers, although it is completely at the opposite end of the terminal from where AF flights depart !

Boarding started on time at 05.45 but once on board it was announced that one passenger had been denied boarding, and their five bags needed to be off-loaded. Mrs Fatbear watched the comedy events outside from her window seat, as it took 50 minutes to locate the bags before we could proceed with the departure. I thought airlines now had baggage processes automated so they knew where everyone‚Äôs luggage was located in the hold, but apparently this must not be the case.

Our aircraft was an Airbus 220 and had a 2-3 configuration, with the middle seat of the three blocked in business class. The leg-room was reasonable and better than I remember in BA's Club Europe.

We eventually took-off over 50 minutes late but with the flight only taking 35 minutes we were on the stand at CDG only 20 minutes behind schedule.

The breakfast served was nicely presented but the pancake with a cheese filling with sliced gherkins and carrots, but it tasted very bland although it was edible. The croissant was fresh, but I didn‚Äôt try the pineapple salad. Champagne was available but it was too early in the morning, even for Mrs Fatbear, so we had just an orange juice ! On such a short flight, we were served just 10 minutes after take-off.",2024-07,2024-08-01,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

Poor AF Customer Service.,Dublin,Osaka,International,"First good news as we were up graded from Premium Economy to Business class from Paris to Osaka and the flight was on time at 9:10am. Then there was a delay of 25 mins to boarding. On board an announcement was made at 9:45 that flight time to Paris would be 1 hr 30 mins but we were still sitting on the runway in Dublin at 10:35 am and then in Paris a short delay for the aircraft to park. We spoke with an AF lady at the  gate and a flight attendant about our connection at 1:20 pm Paris time. We rushed through security to the gate on arrival but missed our flight. We were told at the service desk (after queuing for an hour in very hot conditions) we could travel that evening 9 pm via Incheon with Korean Air. Not only unacceptable but I felt unwell with a heart rate of 135 bpm on my smart watch (I have a pacemaker) and made it clear that it was impossible for me to travel that evening. We were directed to customer services again no empathy or concern, then to a luggage area where some 5 hours later our luggage was returned to us and we were left abandoned at CDG airport ( 70 & 75 yrs old) with absolutely no concern at all for my medical issue or mental health state. Our son in Japan arranged an hotel (I was ok after evening and morning medication) then a flight the next day with Cathay Pacific and we ended up in total almost A$11000 out of pocket, as I was still unwell our son booked us Business class CDG to Osaka as he was very concerned about our well being and mental health. We have since been offered a refund of some A$900 AF should no concern or empathy whatsoever.

Very Bad,Bengaluru,Detroit,International,"Horrible service . I had a round trip from USA to India . My ticket clearly stated I had  2 check in bags allowed . I had no issues flying from Detroit, USA but on my way back from Banglore, India at the check in counter they tell me I can only take back 1 bag? seriously ? it was no where mentioned in my ticket that my return flight allows me to carry only 1 check in bag. what do I do with my second bag throw it ? staff was useless.
they have no knowledge on what they are doing, they do not understand what is customer service. they have no clue. The staff Manager Chinmai was so confused himself had no clue what to do , I had to pay for my bag . He told me to pay for the bag and then file for the claim?
Even when I proceed to pay it was messy. They do not know how to process a simple payment. And they were helping other passengers who came after me just because I came on time and other people came very late and they had their flight on time which was their fault not mine. anyways they did have other counters to take care of it but, they chose to just make it a bad experience for me and my family.

Nightmare on Flight 158,Paris,Dallas,International,"My wife and I flew on AF158 from Paris to Dallas on Wednesday, June 26th. We checked in three pieces of luggage. Air France made a business decision to pull 187 pieces of customer luggage (10,000 lbs) from the flight to accommodate a large air freight shipment to Dallas. We received one bag in Dallas and waited with 80 other customers for 50 minutes without any Air France announcement that bags were pulled off the plane in Paris. We waited another 30 minutes to get a phone number to claim our bags.

We called the Air France number and made a claim. The agent said one of our two bags was going to Dallas on the next flight, but unfortunately, one bag was mislabeled to DEL instead of DFW. It seemed easy to fix: locate the bag in Paris and change the tag to DFW. The agent agreed and said they would contact Paris. Nothing happened. I made three more calls pleading with agents to contact Paris before our bag was scheduled to go to India. Again, nothing. Now, our bag is on the way to India, but the airline cannot confirm if our bag made it to India.

After five phone calls, I also drove to DFW yesterday to talk to the Air France check-in staff, and no one can tell me where my bag is located. Adding to our bad luck, the lost bag was full of gifts we had purchased on our trip for our new grandchildren, birthday gifts, and Christmas gifts.

Over the past 39 years, I have had the opportunity to travel 2.5 million miles on airlines for business and personal travel. This was my first trip and most likely my last on Air France.

Poor long-haul experience,Paris,Phoenix,International,"I have flown business class on British Airways, Lufthansa, United, and American the last couple of years and I was excited to try Air France's new non-stop between Paris and Phoenix.  

On the way over, it was OK.  Air France's business class (at least on the 777 and 787) is definitely a step down from the others.  The food and cabin service is above average, but the seat is poorly laid out and furnished.  The seat controls are on a ledge where my arm rested, which caused unexpected seat movement.  The foot room is cramped.  Using the coat hook blocks part of the video screen. In-flight entertainment is generally poorer on foreign airlines, but Air France offers less selection than BA or Lufthansa.

On the way back my seat malfunctioned and would not recline fully.  I consider this a major problem as lie-flat seats are my primary attraction to business class.  The cabin crew worked on the seat for 20 minutes but ended up shrugging their shoulders.  They said the seat was safe, but it kept sliding back and forth.

As compensation, they offered me flight miles or a $200 voucher.  Since the difference between business and premium economy is well over $1,000, I thought a crappy voucher was ridiculous.  The whole experience doesn't bode well for the success of their expanded non-stop service.

I said ""no"", she said, ""ok I'm going to cancel the reservations, I said ""no"", that went on for awhile until I thought she got it.  Well, after the whole landing in Paris, late, with no luggage debacle, guess what?  She'd cancelled my flight.  I can not express enough how unhelpful and rude the Air France employees were.  I couldn't print a boarding pass or any proof of the flight from the kiosk because - well, my flight had been cancelled, all I had was the confirmation number.  The employees who guard the lines wouldn't let me through - and I speak French BTW.  I got the run around, back and forth.  There was 1 woman in the Business Class area who tried to help but she too was powerless and sent me running.  I was sweating profusely by the time I found the correct ""Ticketing"" office.  By then I'd missed my flight.  The agent acknowledged it was their fault.  I asked for an upgrade due to their mistake, that woman looked at me like I had grown horns.  So they get to make mistakes but we suffer.  I really don't understand how the airlines get away with this.  Air travel has become such a nightmare.  The prices rise but the service nose dives.

Air France employees at the Nice airport took care of everything.  Arranged and paid for our hotel, lunch and dinner and refunded us the fee I paid for the seats on the flight.

None of them seemed knowledgeable or experienced, and I received different answers each time.

Since I couldn't book seats online due to traveling with a pet, I had to do it over the phone. Despite providing my booking reference number, each representative started from scratch, causing unnecessary delays. It's been a week, and my seats are still not properly booked, with each new booking attempt taking 24-48 hours for confirmation.

STUCK FOR 4 HOURS ON THE RUNWAY AND NOT EVEN OFFERED A GLASS OF WATER IN BUSINESS CLASS,Paris,Los Angeles,International,"I have never taken a flight where we were delayed for 4 HOURS ON THE RUNWAY.  Why you may ask? Umm, depends on which of the flight crew you ask during those 4 hours because we got differing answers each time.  And with so many crew members working, you would have thought that instead of the captain giving updates in French for about 5 minutes each time (as opposed to a 30 second to one minute translation in incomprehensible English) there could have been at least one person who could speak English so that we could understand wtf was going on!  To add insult to injury I called the ""customer service"" line to ask if they knew what was going on to which I got a typical AF response from ""Stefan"" who answered me with ""what do you want me to do, fly the plane for you""?

I never got financial compensation for 6h+ flight delay,Paris,Montreal,International,"My flight was delayed for more than 6 hours at the Paris airport. A couple days later I contacted the Air France customer service to claim financial compensation for the delay, which the company is legally meant to provide according to European flight customer regulations. 
Almost 4 months later I haven't received any compensation, and the company stopped following up with me. I called customer service many times and I was always told they would get back in touch with me on the phone and via email, but they never did. I was the one having to do all the follow-up with no positive outcome.

"Unreliable, unethical airlines - stay away",Istanbul,Los Angeles,International,"Our recent flight with Air France was the worst experience we've had in over 30 years of travel with various airlines. We selected Air France specifically for a layover in CDG‚Äîwhere we had prior arrangements‚Äîon our return journey from Istanbul to Los Angeles. However, less than 12 hours before departure, Air France abruptly cancelled our flight without offering any explanation. Despite our attempts to get clarity from their customer service over the phone, we were directed to go to the airport‚Äîan hour away‚Äîto find out more details. This unexpected situation left us scrambling to make new travel arrangements in Istanbul and completely disrupted our plans back home in the US.

About half an hour later, Air France informed us via email that our flight had been rebooked with LOT Airlines via Warsaw, Poland, resulting in an arrival time 4 hours later than our original schedule. Additionally, our flight from Warsaw to Los Angeles experienced an additional 3-hour delay, bringing the total delay to 7 hours.

When we sought compensation under EU 261 regulations, Air France shockingly denied responsibility, claiming our flights were outside the EU. This was perplexing because our original itinerary involved travel to and from CDG, France (within the EU), and we were rerouted through Warsaw, Poland (also within the EU), where we endured a 10-hour layover with significant delays. This ordeal resulted in our arrival time in the US being pushed from 4:05 PM to 11:05 PM, causing immense emotional stress and financial losses due to last-minute constant changes, disruption to work and plans, and navigating foreign countries with limited resources.

We strongly advise against choosing Air France if you value peace of mind. Their actions appeared profit-driven, potentially cancelling our flight due to low passenger numbers and transferring us to LOT Airlines without providing compensation or taking responsibility, based on our profiles. We are crossing Air France off our list forever, and will choose more reliable and ethical airlines for future travel.",2024-06,2024-06-20,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,1.0,1.0,3.4978647686832742,1.0,3.0819906910132473
Air France is the WORST airline & they will lose your luggage!,Nairobi,Newark,International,"Worst airline I‚Äôve ever used. Air hostess was rude on one of the flights. One my return, Air France lost my luggage that had expensive personal items, rental gear and necessities including medicine. Air France has poor customer service and has not given me any updates. The seats are way smaller & uncomfortable than typical international airlines, the food & service sucks. It is not clean and some of their air hostesses are unprofessional & rude. It‚Äôs been over a week now and I have still not received my luggage. I am very upset. I travel very often and this has never happened to me with other airlines. 

Something to note, when I booked I booked via KLM and it‚Äôs website, it was certainly false advertising since it said KLM (which I have no problem with) but as soon as I paid, my tickets came as Air France. I dislike false and pretense advertising disguised as something else. If you merge, let people decipher on their own by the rotten reviews Air France has. This was the worst travel experience I‚Äôve ever had. I have lost my best items and luggage, I‚Äôve missed necessary deadlines and items. I would not recommend Air France to my worst enemy. 

I have global entry so I zoomed through customs & was the first to get to buggage claim. But I waited until the end & nothing!! 
They sent me auto message saying ‚Äúdelayed buggage‚Äù & they actually LOST the buggage & I haven‚Äôt heard anything now for over a week",2024-06,2024-06-20,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
Ultimate Travel Nightmare!!!,Los Angeles,Split,International,"If I could give this business minus 10 stars, I would. Never but never in all my decades of travel have I had a worse experience, and never but never would I ever fly this airline again, even if it meant I had to travel by train across the US and then boat to Europe. ANYTHING would be preferable that experiencing what I experienced with them.

I was moving to Europe with my 3 precious cats, and had purchased tickets for them to fly with me in the cabin. 4 friends accompanied us to help with the move. My travel agent booked us a flight that had a connection in Paris, and when I saw the amount of time at the airport in Paris was only one hour, I was concerned. I checked with my agent and also I phoned Air France several times, to confirm that one hour would be sufficient, and they all assured me that that it would be.

The flight itself was extremely stressful. I had brought with me a portable litter box, so that I could take my 3 cats one by one to the bathroom so they could relieve themselves and not have to go in their carriers. However, when I got up to take the first one (in its carrier) to the bathroom, a flight attendant stopped me and insisted they had to all stay under the seats in their carriers the entire duration of the flight. This was absurd. They were safely in their carriers, and me letting them out in the bathrooms would have caused no harm to anyone!!!! Instead, I was forced to suffer right along with them for the duration of that long flight. It was awful! And of course by the time we arrived, the carriers had been filled with pee and poop, and the smell was way worse than what would have happened had I been allowed to take them to the bathroom. A far worse situation for all of us and for the people around us!!!

Once we went through security and arrived at the gate for our connecting flight in Paris, we were so relieved to see that the plane was still there. But then, shockingly, the woman at the gate told me they had ""just this moment closed it."" However, one of our party was a flight attendant, and she knew the rules as to when the plane doors could be closed, and we were still within the time frame by a few minutes. However, the attendant at the gate apologized and said she had been specifically instructed not to let anyone on the plane who was from the LAX flight, which was totally insane. We begged and pleaded, as we stood there, a party of 5 people with 3 cats who had already endured the long flight from LA and the stress of having to go through security although we were only transitioning. That plane stood there too, at least another 10 minutes, with our empty seats. The entire situation was insane: the airline had very deliberately slammed the door in our faces.

When, in tears, with my 3 poor cats, we went to the desk to inquire about next flights, we were told the next direct flight to Split was 4 days away. That made the refusal to admit us to this flight all the more insane, of course. We then were forced to change terminals yet again, go through security yet again (also more suffering for my cats, who are 14 years old and had already gone through security twice, once in LA and once in Paris). Once we arrived at the desk for Croatia Airlines, I was forced to pay again for my cats and for the extra luggage, although that had all been paid in LA already. We then had to suffer through the subsequent 2 flights, before finally arriving in Split at 11 pm, 20 hours after we had left LA. We had originally chartered a water taxi to take us to the island of Hvar, our ultimate destination, but of course by midnight, it had long been canceled.

Not only all that, but when we arrived, 2 pieces of our luggage did not arrive with us. By the time we finished filling out the forms to report the missing luggage, it was midnight and they locked the airport doors behind us as we left, the last ones to leave the airport. We then had to find a pet-friendly hotel nearby and take taxis to that hotel, incurring additional expenses we never would have had, had we been allowed on that plane in Paris which sat there on the tarmac for 10 minutes as we begged and cried to be let on.

When I reported this horrible situation to Air France and demanded reimbursement for the over $1000 I had been forced to pay (again!!) for my cats and luggage, plus for the hotel we were forced to stay at, I received this response:

""Thank you for your email dated 3 May 2024 regarding your recent experience while travelling with us.

I appreciate that you shared your disappointment with us. Our records shows that the flight change was caused by a booking error on your original flight. As a result, we kindly ask you to contact your travel agency to request for possible reimbursement of your incurred expenses.

I trust I have informed you sufficiently.

It cost me an additional 70 euros for something that could have been avoided. Clearly there were other passengers that had oversized and overweighted carry on luggage that were not checked. Perhaps it was based on if we appeared to be tourists? Upon check in, the attendant never asked to weight my carry on or told us there may be a random check. Our checked bags were underweight and we could‚Äôve easily transferred some of things to our suitcase. I‚Äôve used many airlines and have never encountered this type of service.

Avoid Air France,Venice,Miami,International,"This is our 2nd year of traveling to Europe, both trips return was via Air France.

Both times the experience was not the best.

Last year when our flights were transferred from another airline to Air France- Air France dropped our connection from Barcelona to Paris. we spent 2 hours while on a cruise doing a chat to get connections booked at the cost of over 100 for the chat.

The seats were admittedly economy, but It was Ridiculous how close together the seats were.

Luggage was left in Barcelona.

This year, Venice to Paris, the flight was delayed over 1.5 hours, we were told it was air traffic controller strike. 

We arrived in Paris with 15 minutes to get to gate. We made it through customs and to the gate no more than 5 minutes after original gate closure. There were at least 15 passengers impacted. When we arrived at the gate the attendants were still there- but the gate was closed. 

The attendant and customer service informed us it was the captain‚Äôs decision not to wait, but the plain sat at the gate for at least 15 minutes after scheduled take off and then sat on the runway near the gate for at least another 15 minutes.

The captain has the manifest and knows there were several ppl delayed.

We were put up at a low end hotel, had to purchase toiletries for the evening, one of the couples on our group found roaches in the room during the night.

The next day, our flight was delayed over 30 minutes because passengers from connecting flight were delayed.

Air France -Food not great and luggage system the worst,Mexico City,Paris,International,"I was looking forward to this flight, but the overall experience really underwealmed, and the luggage issue was... BAD.  (I'll explain).
First, the lounge set up in Mexico City for Air France sucks.  As to the flight,  the A350-900 is a very nice aircraft, but the amenities did not impress.  The pillow and blanket were cheap.  The service was ok and the attendants were friendly but it still seemed like it as ""phoned in"".  The beef (steak dish), was cool, bland, and just bad.  The eggs in the morning was better.  What really made this trip a bad experience was the fact that Air France chose to overload cargo on this flight and had to leave off ALL passenger luggage.  ( You heard me).  That meant bags, pets, etc.  We were not told.  When we arrived in Paris we were advised that no bags had been loaded because the plane would have been overweight.  EVERYONE had to submit a claim.  I felt bad for those in the back of coach that would have been in a long line.  What made it worse was that they did not update their system so even though they did get the bags out the next evening the claim was not updated til about 4 hours before my bag was delivered to my hotel at 10PM the evening of the next day.  I was leaving for Marseille the following morning and wondering if I'd have a bag.   If you want to track your bag, either get a GPS tag or fly another airline.
I had to buy a hoodie and some minimal items (socks, etc.), and it was raining in Paris.  I used the credit card tranactions to file claim and they didn't want to accept (keep store receipts unless they get ruined!).  They compensated me a portion out of it.

You can never reach them since every worker at AirFrance is enjoying life with a baguette without giving any xxxx to your lost luggage, even if you are flying in business class!!! Unbelievable.

Experience flying Air France operated by Euroatlantic,Paris,New Delhi,International,"I flew from Paris to Delhi by Air France  - for operational reasons Air France has taken on charter a flight from Euroatlantic airlines. The flight was an old Boeing 777-200. Just before boarding time in Paris we were told that there is a delay of one hour due to technical inspection of the flight. They kept extending it upto 2 hrs 55 minutes ( making sure that it does not cross 3 hrs). Flight was scheduled to start at 10.35 hrs - they have announced last that it would start at 13.30 hrs. After that there was no announcement.  We were carted into a bus like cattle to be taken to the aircraft at about 13.20 hrs. After being boarded - AC went off, lights went off  - I guess crew was checking.  At about 13.50 crew announced that they were not given clearance by ATC and there would be further delay of 40 minutes.  Journey started 4 hrs behind schedule. 

May be the old aircraft in not designed to handle turbulence  - we had a free rock and roll dance for over six hours in the 8 ¬Ω hrs flight - mind you we were in Business class.  Imagine the plight of others at the rear end of the flight.

Flight attendants in Business class don't understand English- had to use all possible methods to make them understand that I need vegetarian food. Hot coffee served spilled over the entire place and the attendant blames it on turbulence.

We missed our connection due to their own plane that took off 2 hrs late.When contacted they said they are unable to do any kind of compensation due to some 'European Union 'BS.

Worst experience,New Delhi,Vancouver,International,"I have had the worst experience one could ever had with Air France. I booked a round trip from Vancouver to Delhi. For my departure my luggage was not not loaded on my flight so I went to my home empty handed and waited three days for my luggage. If that was only thing that happened to me on this trip I could have ignored it. BUT in my arrival flights, my route was Delhi to Mumbai to Paris to Vancouver. My Delhi to Mumbai flight was delayed due to incoming flight that was delayed and we reached mumbai one hour late to scheduled time which was fine as we landed at 1:25 and my next flight was at 2:10. I could have taken the flight But your staff stopped us in the middle and told us that we missed the flight even though the flight had not taken off yet. It was later that I got to know that my Mumbai to Paris flight was overbooked. That the staff deliberately stopped us from taking the flight even though we had our boarding passes. Next I had to wait for two full days to my new flight that was allocated to me and for that flight I had to go back to Delhi. WHAT was the point in me coming to Mumbai if I had to go back to Delhi again!!! I had booked my trip 4months earlier so that I can be rest assured that everything will go well. But I did not even get any email that my flight was overbooked and that will be given a new flight ticket. I had to travel 6 hours to reach to Delhi from my home, I think that was enough time that you could have informed me and i would not have waited 2days. I was supposed to start work on march 24 as I was originally landing on march 22. Will I be getting reimbursed for this major inconvenience? For the Time wasted? For the time I missed from my work?  Therefore, I want full refund for my flight ticket and the money I had to spend in these days. 

And now when I try to claim for a refund with Air France , I am told because the flight delayed was not Air France but indigo I have to contact indigo and now when I contact indigo I am told by indigo customer service that indigo shares a code share with Air France  Thus, I have to take it further with Air France. None of the airline is ready to take the initiative to admit their fault.

Zero Stars for Air France,Chicago,Paris,International,"Let me start by saying we will never fly Air France again. Months ago we purchased two nonstop tickets from Chicago to Paris. The night before our flight, we got an email that we've been rebooked Chicago>Detroit>Paris, with the first leg being on Delta, the second leg being Air France in Detroit. We were annoyed because we paid for a nonstop ticket, but figured, at least we will still get in Paris, just a few hours after our original itinerary. Well, Delta to Detroit was delayed, and even with 20 of us that got rebooked on that Delta flight in Chicago trying to make the Paris connection, Air France did not wait for us in Detroit. We landed 36 minutes after the scheduled Paris departure. Now, we were stuck for a whole day in Detroit. We had horrible room accommodations, a shuttle that never showed up, and a day wasted on our short itinerary. To make matters worse, there was no one at Detroit airport from Air France (AF) to talk to all day so we tried working through an agent with Delta, but they could not see AF's international flights to help. Since we were now arriving in Paris a whole day later, we had a hotel night we had to pay for, museum tickets purchased in advance we could not use, and dinner reservations with a strict cancellation policy that charged us for not showing, despite our emails and pleas to not charge. Regardless, AF initial decision to bump 20 of us off the original nonstop flight in Chicago to Paris, caused us all to miss a whole day in Paris and cost us hundreds and hundreds of dollars. I made a claim on Air France's website, which they replied to and said because the delay was less than 3 hours, no compensation would be rewarded. What are they even talking about? They clearly did not read our claim, so I called customer service, to which they could only reopen the claim but we cannot talk to anyone on the phone who handles the claims. I pleaded with them on two separate phone calls over two days to please let me talk to someone in claims or customer service or anyone who can help, to which they were very strict in saying there is no one for me to call, I just need to wait another week to hear back by email. Sure, the email's that they don't read and just send random responses to... all I can think of now is to get their attention by 1 star reviews. If I could give 0 [zero] I would.

3kg PUPPY PET IN PLANE COSTS MORE THAN YOU !,Amsterdam,Lyon,Europe,"I just wanted to share with you my disappointment concerning the bad experience I had today with Air France-KLM, which still charges exorbitant fees (240 euros) just to take a <3kg puppy under my seat. There is no reason they should charge more for a pet than for supplementary luggage. In the end, for a 1h30 flight from Ams to Lyon, my dog will cost more than my ticket. (I paid 188 euros roundtrip; he costs 240 euros).
In addition to the excessive charges, I had a very poor experience with their customer service. I had to contact the customer service team three times to address my issue JUST to add my pet!. During my first call, my request was misunderstood, and my dog's weight was mistakenly recorded as 250 kg, leading to the cancellation of my request for the return flight. Despite this error, I received no follow-up communication via email or phone from Air France.
Each call required me to take 15-20 minutes out of my workday just to wait for an agent to respond. The second time I called, I was instructed to call back 48 hours later. It is unreasonable to expect customers to repeatedly take time out of their busy schedules to resolve such issues.
To boycott, I invite you to systematically write a complaint whenever you have to take your animal with you and pay such a price. I hope it will help change the mentality. If needed, I am pasting here some paragraphs that can help you write your complaint:
""It is important to highlight that such exorbitant fees for traveling with pets contribute to the abandonment of animals, as many pet owners might not afford these additional costs. According to Article 13 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), animals are sentient beings, and the welfare requirements of animals should be respected. Charging such high fees and providing inadequate service does not align with this principle and discourages responsible pet ownership.
I kindly request that you review this matter and consider adjusting your pet travel policies to be more reasonable and accommodating. Additionally, I urge you to improve your customer service processes to prevent such frustrating experiences in the future. Lowering these fees and enhancing service quality would not only support animal welfare but also enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.""
I know it takes time for you guys, but I think the more we do it, the more these companies will understand the urgency of changing their policies on animal welfare.

"Tight seats and we spent about 2 hours trying to get boarding passes online, never got mine",Budapest,Eugene,International,"First, when we tried to get our boarding passes online, we probably spent at least 2 hours.  My husband was finally able to get his boarding passes added to his phone wallet, but I could not, and a message appeared that said I had to get them in person at the airport.  We have never had so much difficulty getting boarding passes in the past.  Usually it just takes us a few minutes.  Next, the seats were extremely tight.  The flights were on time, which was great.  The crew was wonderful.  The cabin was really warm.  Also, there was mixed messaging as to whether we should get the KLM app or not, and I even heard people at the airport asking if they needed to find KLM or if it was an Air France flight.  The main problem for me was the problems with their website and getting boarding passes.  We had our flight number and all the information we needed, but it was a difficult system for both of us.  I am not the best when it comes to stuff like that, but my husband is an expert, and he was having a lot of difficulty.",2024-05,2024-06-02,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,3.0
Extremely poor,Paris,Bastia,Domestic,"Flew Air France today Paris, Orly to Bastia, Corsica.
Chose AF over cheaper airlines as we have 2 larger checked bags as are travelling from Australia for nearly 5 weeks in Europe.
Flight was at 12.25pm. Arrived at the airport at 10.25am to be faced with an almost one hour Air France bag drop queue. Once we achieved this enormous hurdle we were then faced with another 45 minutes queueing for security. We have been in five airports worldwide in the last two weeks and this was total chaos. Ended up having to run from security ( where our hand luggage  bag was held up due to containing an iPad which  no other country had any security issues with) to the departure gate with minutes to spare. We were the last people to board the full flight before the gate closed.
Expensive and extremely stressful experience.
In hindsight we should have booked with Transavia who looked to have a very professional queue free checkin area.
I will avoid ever flying Air France again!
Luckily we are flying Air Corsica when we leave. I hope they have better customer service.",2024-06,2024-06-01,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.1219191587249426,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0

The Luggage Carrier From Hell,Singapore,Paris,International,"Air France was a real disappointment. Our flight left late but arrived on time (good), but the seats were unusually angled, so both awkward and exposed, the cabin service was average, the entertainment was average and the meals and other alternatives were unexciting.

The worst was the luggage. Our one bag did not arrive. That happens, and at CDG the service to report the missing bag was quick and straightforward. Then came the horrendous problems. Despite promises that the bag would be located and delivered within at worst 48 hours, it was not delivered after 48 hours. An email said it had been located somewhere in the world. Calls to the Air France helpline received sympathy and brush-offs, although they took down the address for delivery after days 1 -3. The WhatsApp bots were just the same: standard expressions of sympathy, and no answers on when anything might happen

We were reassured that we would be contacted before the bag was delivered, but on Day 5 we received an SMS from Chronopost (had to look them up)  out of the blue with a case number. Using that data we found a website that said we had to call a specific number in office hours, and that way we found the bag had been delivered to the hotel we were staying on the day of arrival for our S. Air France's WhatsApp and helpline said they could do nothing - it was not their problem because they had hand-fobbed it off to some other firm.

Two French nationals helped us by calling the number and speaking to the service, but were told that the only possible outcome was delivery to the Day 1 hotel. We had to accept it, so almost a week after leaving we arranged for the bag to be collected from the Day 1  hotel (at our cost...) when it was delivered as promised on Day 7...but it simply was not delivered. No excuses. 

Days 8 and 9 were a weekend, and no-one would do anything.

The bag was delivered to the Day 1 hotel on Day 10, even though Air France had been given and duly recorded details of the hotels on later days (with promises that the delivery address would be updated...)

We lodged a claim for the few items we had bought out of necessity. I did not want to put bank account details down on a hotel wifi (and did not have the IBAN numbers, as Australia does not use them), so I lodged a claim as directed... which Air France declared pen by providing a reference number, then promptly closed!!

Over the next three weeks not a single one of my perhaps 20 emails, WhatsApp requests or web-based requests for updates or assistance was answered. However, I did receive almost daily requests to fill out a survey to rate their social media. What a terribly unfunny joke!

Once back in Australia, I rang Air France on a number hidden away in one form. It was the number for tour operators, but the person who answered was good enough to give me the number for the desk handling baggage claims. That desk is open 3 hours a day, 5 days a week (more terrible service), but when i finally found someone they actually helped, and within 24 hours I had another form email promising expenses would be paid if receipts were fully itemised.

I am not holding my breath. Air France has no ethics. It has failed in providing any other form of assistance, and blathered away about being sorry while doing absolutely nothing. Why would it honour a promise to pay?",2024-04,2024-06-01,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0
Air France's Operations are Abysmal,Montreal,Paris,International,"Air France lost my luggage on a connecting flight. Unf@#$ing believable!! It's supposed to come in on a connecting flight. And I'm supposed to trust that they'll find it, and deliver it to my hotel. But some of my favorite cloths were that bag. The first order of business is to buy some new underwear to tide me over, lol!

But this is all top of what was a terrible experience. My check-in experience with Air France was horrible. I had all the paperwork to skip a longer queue. I'd already digitally checked in and printed a boarding pass. But the agent directed me to the wrong line and made me wait an additional half hour just to drop off my suitcase. So from initial check in, to delays at departure, Air France's operations were just abysmal. I will never fly with Air France again.",2024-05,2024-05-31,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
Air France Poor Customer Service,Lyon,Manchester,Europe,"I knew Air France had a questionable reputation regarding lost luggage but I thought what are the chances? I was moving back to the UK from France and didn't realize how much stuff I needed to relocate. I had pre-booked 2 bags and also paid for the insurance coverage and checked a third bag in at the airport. When I arrived at my final destination after a stopover in Paris, none of my bags had arrived on the carousel. I waited 48 hours to receive two of my three bags and had to consistently chase Air France for answers regarding my third bag. Only about a year later did they pay me a fraction of what the contents of that bag were worth and didn't even pay the full amount of the insurance coverage. This experience I had with Air France was disappointing considering I was a frequent flyer. They are 'okay' as far as flight companies go, I would just never recommend checking a bag with them.",2023-06,2024-05-30,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.1219191587249426,1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0819906910132473
Lack of Customer Service for lost luggage,Charlottetown,Paris,International,"My wife and I flew from Charlottetown PE Canada to CDG Paris on April 24/24 and arrived on April 25/24. When we arrived my checked luggage was no aboard the flight and was in Montreal PQ. We advised Customer Service about the missing luggage and the advised it would be delivered in a day or two, however the did not offer any advances for necessary item or clothing. 

From April 25 to May 12/24 we travelled in France, Switzerland, Germany, the Netherlands and returned to Canada on May 12/24. My luggage was not actually lost as Air France‚Äôs delivery delivered the luggage to our temporary residence in Caen, France when after we had departed for Basel, Switzerland. As there was no one at the home to accept the luggage the delivery drives tossed the luggage over a tall fence into the courtyard. The luggage remained in Caen until May 12 when the driver finally picked up the luggage and delivered it to Air France. We arrived home on April 14th and my luggage finally arrived at our home on April 18th/24.

During our stay in Europe I spoke to Air France Customer Service almost every day requesting them to contact their driver and request he return the luggage to Air France. My request went unheard and the only thing they would report that the luggage would arrive when ever they received it and refused to contact their driver.

As part of our European vacation we were to have a 7 day Rhine River Cruise and required to purchase new clothes for the cruise to replace my missing clothes. One thing Air France Customer Service repeated saying that they knew how I felt and how frustrated I was without my luggage. Air France Customer Service representatives do not know how frustrating they are to deal with or how a traveller goes without his/her luggage. I am of the opinion the Air France Customer Service are not worthy to classify themselves as Customer Service as they provided me with out any assistance from April 25th to May 30/24 as my claim for compensation for damaged luggage and clothing purchases have not been addressed after providing all required documentation and receipts.",2024-04,2024-05-30,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

Agent tells me that we have been split up and my ticket was cancelled and rebooked to Amsterdam, which according to her is my final destination, but my mother is fine to go to Florence.  Except I booked a ticket to Florence with my mom....and after 15 minutes of arguing I convince her I am indeed supposed to go to Florence.  Rebooked me 5 hours later to Rome, then connected to Florence via ITA Airways, and find out after landing that my luggage had been sent to Amsterdam.  Three days later I receive my luggage in Florence.  Filed a claim and Air France denied all responsibility, claiming I was bumped from connecting flight due to ""issues with air traffic control, which is out of their control,"" while at the same time claiming no responsibility for delayed baggage since ""the final airline service used was not Air France and thus all claims must be handled through that carrier.""  Never in my life have I had to deal with such an incompetent, poorly run organization that cared so little for its customers.  There are no numbers you can call, no one to speak to, no one to resolve issues, no one to follow up with, not a single employee that cares.

Disappointment and waste of time,Newark,Paris,International,"My husband and I booked a premium economy flight to Paris for our wedding anniversary back in January. We were all excited and set to fly in premium economy on May 30. On May 28th we received an email that we were being downgraded to regular economy. We were traveling with two other couples, and one couple got to stay in premium economy, and the other couple got automatically moved to another seat in economy. We were not automatically moved and in fact when we tired to move  our seats The website said we had to pay. So then my husband called and was on the phone with Air France for an hour and after an hour of discussing the situation and trying to find out if what our refund would be, he got hung up on. So then he called back and got somebody more competent, but she didn‚Äôt even offer to put us back in premium economy. Instead she was confused because she said we never booked premium economy, which wasn‚Äôt the case. She couldn‚Äôt even tell us what our refund would be we had to fill out a claim form, even though we were the ones downgraded. Then the other couple called and somehow they got moved back to premium economy. So our two friends are now in premium economy and we are in economy. The issue was, they changed the plane and are flying a smaller airplane. The smaller airplane doesn‚Äôt have the row in premium economy that we were originally in so we don‚Äôt know if this is the reason we were downgraded. Our friends, however we‚Äôre also in that row.

Comfy overnight flight in Premium Economy,Antananarivo,Paris,International,"I fly frequently with AF but for the first time, I decided to use their Premium economy for my flight from TNR to PRG via CDG. The price was favorable. For the long leg from TNR they used the old type seats, The shell seat on Boeing 777-200. This type of the seat does not recline but the back support just moves down. Still, it was quite a comfy seat with ample legroom. After priority boarding, we were welcomed by a glass of champagne and orange juice. After one hour flying the crew started to serve dinner. The advantage is you are served first so both choices are available. The meal was standard economy fare but with better presentation, with glass rather than plastic cups and real cutlery. Shortly before the landing, the breakfast consisting of hot sandwich, yogurt, and a sweet bun was served. The cabin crew was friendly, attentive, and regularly presented in the cabin. But there was also a negative aspect. The priority service is included for the Premium Economy class. But unfortunately it was non-existent. It worked just for priority boarding, while for the airport security control and passport control at CDG did not. Even business class passengers had to queue inappropriate time. At the top of everything my luggage arrived as the last one. But if you find a good deal for AF Premium economy can recommend to take it.",2024-05,2024-05-27,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0

In 40 years of travel THE WORST airline experience!,London,Mexico City,International,"An absolute disgrace.  I rarely review airlines because they are a necessary evil, and I travel at least once a month to various parts of the world.

I booked to fly to Mexico from London via Paris with a short stop over in CDG.  As I left for the first flight, I got a message to say my connecting flight was delayed by 6 hours.  ‚ÄòOh well‚Äô I thought, suck it up.   

The plane took off from LHR on time the pilot made 3 attempts to land in CDG but decided it was too windy.  Other flights were landing though!  He took up to Amsterdam Schiphol and landed there, he made a long announcement in French, nothing in English and we were told to get off quickly and someone would assist us in AMS terminal.   There was no one there!  A whole plane load with elderly and young, just abandoned.  I walked to a different gate and found a bemused KLM staff who tried to help, but all they could do was to say ‚Äòlook for an email from Air France‚Äô.  It was 6 hours we waited without any support, until an email came to say our flight from London to Paris had been rescheduled til next morning!  Erm, we were in Amsterdam terminal!   An hour later we got a mail telling us to ignore last mail and wait further details.  Around 9 pm we got a mail saying we would travel to Paris next morning at 10am - laughable!  

Spent night in a pod in AMS, still no support from Air France, no one to speak to!  So I went to get the 10am flight next day and as I got to the gate, the next message stated it was delayed until 1pm!  This meant I would miss my second day flight to Mexico, so I had to abandon the trip and got KLM to return me to London.  

It didn‚Äôt end there!  My bag had to be tracked and was later delivered home (good service from the London baggage firm).  I wanted to speak to an Air France rep about compensation and costs.  There was no one in Heathrow, except I found a couple of women at a checkin desk who just shrugged their shoulders and told me to fill in a claim online!   

I applied for a refund of my fare through. Virgin Atlantic (who booked the trip).  I got the airfare refunded after 5 weeks with no chance to contact anybody and was told to claim costs and complete from Air France.  Again another form online, no one to speak to!  I was informed by email the flight was cancelled due to weather (not that the pilot was a coward), and no compensation was due, despite twice being informed of long delays and spending 24 hours in Schiphol airport!  They owe me accommodation, costs for cancelled accommodation in Mexico, lost business and for the food and drinks I had to buy at the airport.  

They abandoned a whole flight, were uncontactable, ignorant and incompetent.  I shall never fly Air France again as long as I live.  I also spend over a million pounds a year on Air Cargo and this experience has made me ban the airline from my list of suppliers.",2024-02,2024-05-25,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0

Some French passengers behaved inappropriately, as if they could do anything - embarrassing. Parsonal didn't have a problem with them, and they still joked together in French. I understood them, and they downright slander some passengers who, unlike them, have an upbringing. I have to mention that this flight on May 22, 2024 in the afternoon was terrible.

A superb airline,Ottawa,Bordeaux,International,"Our travel agent found a good sale for our first trip together to France and it seemed appropriate that it would be with Air France. It‚Äôs an airline we‚Äôd never tried before, so there were many firsts during this vacation.

We had access to the AF lounges flying from Ottawa to Paris and then on to Bordeaux and back again. The lounges were all excellent, with cheerful, friendly and helpful staff, and good food and drinks.

Once on board the flight to Paris from Ottawa on March 26, the stewards were very professional and friendly, especially C√©line, who went above and beyond the call of duty to make us comfortable. Our plane to Paris ran into a long stretch of turbulence, so they had to serve the meal late. Unfortunately, the flight was marred by further turbulence later on, so it was somewhat stressful.

By contrast, the flight home from Paris in an A330 was uneventful. I was able to stretch out for a snooze ‚Äì I‚Äôm over six-foot three, so I consider that to be something of a miracle that I could do that!

The food and drinks on board all four of our flights was as sumptuous as you can imagine for such an airline in business class.

Hand luggage in cabin only allowed to high-cost tickets,Madrid,Paris,Europe,"If you want to fly from Madrid to Paris for business during the week, forget about this airline. On a normal Tuesday, they deny you your boarding pass unless you check in your carry-on luggage because apparently ""they are full."" The reason they give you is no better: ""you paid too little for your ticket."" The truth is, being used to flying with Iberia for work, I now understand why the travel agency staff never book with Air France. I have already filed a complaint with the airline, but I don't think it changed anything, so the only thing left for me is to not fly with them again.

 I hope at least this helps those of you who experience the same thing and are unable to get your boarding pass via web/app to know that it's because they want you to check in your luggage. If you are traveling with someone, it‚Äôs as simple as having one person hold all the carry-on luggage so they don't see you with it. If they see you, they will deny you the boarding pass.

Don't fly Air France,Honolulu,Paris,International,"Our 50th wedding anniversary is in September 2024.  When I was making flight reservations on December 27, 2023 to fly to Paris on September 16, 2024, I discovered Air France Premiere Class and realized Air France had a flight AF 0025 from Los Angeles to Paris on which this class was available.  So I booked flights from Honolulu Hawaii to Paris through the Air France website and paid for Premiere Class to Paris and Business Class on the return;  Premiere Class cost about $6000.00 US more.

On April 19, 2024, I just happened to check our reservations and found that Air France had changed them from Premiere Class to Business Class without notifying me and/or crediting the difference in air fare to my credit card.  So, I called Air France customer service line and tried to alter our reservations to connect with their flight AF 0023 that also went from Los Angeles to Paris, but was told I wasn‚Äôt allowed to do that because those Premiere Class seats were for new reservations, not for changes (in spite of the fact that I had paid for the seats four months prior).  I decided that this person had to be a ‚Äúweekend‚Äù person and that I would check again on Monday, April 22, 2024.  In the mean time, the Premiere Class seats were taken by other people.

On Monday, April 22nd, I called again and the gentleman I spoke with did try to find Premiere Class seats, but was unable to find anything that would get us into Paris on September 17 (we have a tour starting) so we changed our flights from the Island of Kauai to Paris through Los Angeles in Business Class, but I am still due my refund of the difference between Premiere Class and Business Class which is about $6000.00.  

I called Air France customer service again on May 17, 2024 to at least get a contact phone number for some one who could give me my $6000.00 back.  The young woman I spoke to told that I would not be able to get my money back until I take the flight in September because that is their policy - no other reason.  I asked for some one else I could contact and she gave me an email address to which I sent an email on May 19, 2024 explaining the situation and asked, for the fourth time, for my fare difference back immediately.

The following morning I got a reply by email from Lorenzo, to go back to the customer service phone number that had told me to contact his department.  Basically, giving me the run around.  I am at this point going to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Transportation  that says refunds by airlines are to be given ""promptly"" (within 7 days) and trying to find contact information for the head of Air France North America.

I have been flying for decades and been all over the world, but never been treated this poorly by an Airline.  Quite frankly,  Air France practices fraud as their business model.  They are happy to take you money for one fare, involuntarily downgrade your class of service, and keep your money for the higher fare.",2024-05,2024-05-20,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,1.0,1.0,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

"Pros, cons and advices on my experience of great airline and great staff!!",Tel Aviv,Paris,International,"PROS
*  Good fine international airline
*  Good clean airplane 
*  Good service and good food
*  Good entertainment
*  Fantastic helpful caring on line telephone staff
*  Very respectable price for multileg journey of TLV-CDG-IAD-CDG-TLV

CONS 
CDG airport is big but signage is OK

 ""I VISITED THIS PLACE""...  
... because I wanted to go to Paris to visit the Musee d'Orsay for the 150th commemoration of the impressionist art exhibitions, and then to continue to Washington DC.

This airline offered the best price and a nonstop flight for each segment.

The telephone staff were incredibly useful and helpful.  The airplane staff also.

The flight left on time and arrived on time.

The middle section aisle seat that I secured was good, except for the one person next to me, who coughed with sputum the entire time, but I wore a mask and decided that this elderly somewhat unkempt man had a chronic bronchitis which was not infectious, and I did not get sick.

 WAS IT WORTH THE COST?
It most certainly was

 WOULD ""I VISIT THIS PLACE"" AGAIN?
Yes- this is a preferred airline for me and I enjoy going to Paris

Very Disappointing,Paris,Los Angeles,International,"We flew Business Class from CDG to LAX. It was a disappointing experience. Announcements in English were barely comprehensible, from the Captain to the flight attendants. Why can‚Äôt they speak slowly in English when they have such heavy accents?

Seats were quite hard and it was comfortable only when fully reclined. The seat cushions had the feel of economy seating.

Service was above average, so kudos to the flight attendants for their smiles and professionalism. Beverages and food were sub-standard. I was looking forward to their Pommard Champagne, but it was at room temperature pre-departure and during the flight. The same for white wine. I asked the flight attendant about it and he just said ‚Äúdesole, monsieur‚Äù. This was a real bummer for me. Why can‚Äôt they pre-chill these items which are so iconically French?  For lunch we started with an appetizer of a tiny maybe 2‚Äù square plate of cream cheese, hazelnut and pine nut crumble. It was disgusting. Would have preferred nuts. The Shrimp Starter was bland. I selected the Crab and Shrimp Ravioles with Breton curry sauce. The ‚Äúraviole‚Äù was one big ravioli (odd) vs the little square ones I‚Äôm used to, and it did not have a heavy seafood taste. The only thing that saved the dish was the wonderful curry sauce. Prior to arrival we had Chicken fillet with tomato sauce, a dish that was fairly dry.  The bread roll was hard and dry, obviously past its prime. The disappointing ‚Äúdessert‚Äù was a Madeleine sponge cake which was a dry spongy mess. 

Overall, we were disappointed in the onboard seating experience, the food, and the Champagne and white wine served at room temperature.",2024-05,2024-05-17,3.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0
Air France are good and quite stable!,Copenhagen,Paris,Europe,"Copenhagen-Paris 16th May. 2024 on a A320. Checked in on-line but to no avail, as luggage has to be checked in anyway. Check in refused to transfer my luggage to the next leg of journey, which was extremely inconvenient for transit in Paris and costed me at least an hour of extra struggle. Previously, AF in CPH often checked in my luggage to final destination. However, this service is obviously unpredictable, depending on who sits at the counter. The station manager tried and even took over the checking in. However, eventually she declined as she failed to identify any AF agreement with the concerned (next) airline: Rwandair. Boarding smooth, full flight; on time; luggage arrived well in Paris. Onboard, given emergency seat, fast track. Given access to ‚ÄúApartment lounge‚Äù in Copenhagen due to FB status. This lounge is not worldclass, but is nowadays likely the best in CPH airport concerning food and drinks. Onboard, no free WiFi and no IFE.

Bad communication and connection help,Zanzibar Island,Paris,International,"The food and the service was okay - the worst part was that we had an hour delay and wouldn‚Äôt have our connecting flight have 30 min delay we wouldn‚Äôt get the flight.

Worst airline ever,Paris,Los Angeles,International,"As an Airline Pilot myself, I understand the frustration that comes with passengers bringing a large quantity of baggage. I also understand the reason airlines prefer less bags and charge for additional weight/pieces. As I booked my parents standby to and from India, we didn't know in advance what airline they would be returning with(along with baggage restrictions) based on loads, until shortly before their return. The issue in this circumstance is that they were charged a total of $980 Canadian for 2 legs which we believe is an unreasonable amount. It appears that Air France has decided to just charge whatever they want to maximize profit with little regard for customer service and a positive experience for guests, especially ones travelling interline.
Here is the experience from my parents point of view:
Our trip with Air France started in Delhi, India where we were booked to fly to Paris and then to Vancouver on 29th Feb, 2024
Although the Staff at Indian Airport was very friendly, they did charge for extra suitcases for me and my wife, from Delhi to Vancouver at $120 CAD each.
We each had a cabin briefcase and a personal item with us which was allowed without any issue.
Interestingly my itinerary mentioned the flight departure at 1:45 AM as well as the online check-in, but the boarding pass indicated the time as 5:15 AM.
I confirmed the flight time by calling Air France office in Delhi and confirmed the time as 5:15 AM which means that my connecting flight from Paris to Vancouver was no longer an option for me. The Paris-Vancouver flight was already departing by the time we reached Paris.
Our son booked us to Vancouver via Los Angeles through Air France and then through WestJet from Los Angeles to Vancouver.
The customer service at Paris Airport was the worst we have ever seen. No one was really ready to talk to you if you didn't speak French. While booking our luggage again at Paris to Los Angeles , we were asked to pay for 2nd suitcase again. We showed them the paper that we have already paid for the extra suitcase at Delhi Airport so they let us go.
While going through the line for security check we were directed to another place and asked to weigh cabin case and personal bag together and were told that the weight is more than 12kg so we have to go back and book the cabin cases. We tried to explain that we are interline standby travelers and we are already connecting through an Air France flight where it was not an issue, but the person there was not ready to listen to us nor was he talking to us in English. He just kept pushing us to go and book our cabin bags.
We had to go back and book our cabin briefcases and they charged us an excessive amount for that (240 Euro for each of the 2 cabin briefcases)  
We wanted to talk to someone and raise our concerns but no one was ready to talk to us or listen to us , probably because we were English speaking.

As someone in the industry, I believe it would be hard to justify this amount. I look forward to your response and a chance for Air France to show they do value fairness and most importantly, customer service.

After filing a complaint on their website, AF has been having us jump through hoops, utilizing delay tactics and refusal to allow communication with a supervisor. The claim is still pending with no real response.",2024-02,2024-05-11,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
"Avoid this company, one of the worst customer services I ever experienced",Paris,Algiers,International,"Terrible experience with Air France. Have tried to book flights for my elderly parents using their senior pass. My mum's pass is not recognised when I book online.

Cover ups and lies.,Paris,Boston,International,"Our trip was planned months ago.  I booked PRemium Economy seats through Delta who then assigned us to an Air France flight.  Our flight to Paris was OK, but coming home our troubles started with the gate agent who neglected to tell us our ""assigned"" seats were not available and he changed us to stand by status.   We had no clue until it was time to baord our flight.  Then we are told that one of our seats is ""broken"" and there are no more premium economy seats available.  So I let my friend have the original unbroken assigned seat and I opted for economy (it was that or stay in Paris :() Then my friend is assigned a totally different premium seat instead of the window seat she wanted sitting with me.  She is placed next to a rude man who made the flight uncomfortable.  I move to economy.
Then my friend notices people are sitting in the seats that my email confirmation listed as ours!  So now I feel I was blatantly lied to.  If it were not for physical disabilities we would gladly fly economy but her knees and my asthma are both limiting conditions- so we pay the extra to have space.

Another additional affront occurred when the gate agent was in the middle of helping us when a male demanded attention immediately and she dropped us to deal with him.

"Spend Your Whole Vacation on the Phone with AF!

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
Absolutely horrible customer service and no way to contact the claims department after illegally denying a valid claim.  They use run-around and ignore tactics so they do not have to pay.  I am sad to say this is the worst airline I have ever encountered.  Even Spirit gets bags to where I am going.  

We checked two bags for a trip to Paris with a layover in Heathrow.  Both bags were lost in Heathrow.  One bag was delivered 4 days into the trip.  The 2nd bag was returned to our home 3 weeks later (which we are grateful we actually got it back, from what I am reading from the lost luggage of Air France FB page - check it out for real).  But that was only because my husband went to CDG and spent 2 hours there with the lost luggage department and had them track it down in Heathrow (which was at the end of the trip and then it got sent home).  This is after spending our entire two week vacation buying clothes, shoes, doing laundry, and spending hours calling AF every day to get a status update. 

We submitted the claim online as we were instructed to in order to be reimbursed for all the expenses.  The claim was quickly denied because they say it was made more than the 21 allowed time frame from when the bag was delivered.  Very conveniently for them they only looked at the first bag.  We then respond with the information about the 2nd bag, submit all the documentation (which had already been provided).  This is where they ghost you.  Once the claim is closed that is it.  Nothing you do will get you to anyone that can help you.  The phone number which has an option for ‚Äúcheck the status of your claim‚Äù, one would think that would take you to the claims department, it does not, it takes you to reservations, and they cannot do anything about the claim except for ‚Äúput a note‚Äù on it and there are no supervisors.  There is no way to submit a complaint or call to talk to anyone else, the whole phone system only takes you to reservations.",2023-06,2024-05-07,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
Awful customer service,Lagos,London,International,"My flight to London was canceled and the next flight wasn't available for nearly 11 hours, with no compensation other than a 15 Euro meal ticket. The notification of the delay came after boarding the first flight so there was nothing to be done. The customer service was awful at the airport, I tried to rebook- luggage issues etc. I had a toddler with me so wanted to see if it was possible, i fully understood when they said it wasn't but the attitude was unkind and you couldn't get a lounge until three hours before the flight. On my way back from London there was no food on one flight due to staff shortage and then only a veggie option on the other, fine for me but not for many others  but no apology was given and the crew were rude to those asking. This is my second negative experience (first was when they lost my luggage and stroller and only returned the luggage and claimed they didn't have the stroller).

Unorganized worst flying experience both ways,Paris,Seattle,International,"Traveling to Italy from Seattle with my family through Air France when they cancelled our flight 7 hours before we were supposed leave. No one helped us rebook and we figured out an earlier flight ourselves. Things happen and we got to spend an extra day in Italy so at first we just looked at the positives. 

On the way back however, we were supposed to fly out of Napoli airport to Paris for a connecting flight directly to Seattle. They delayed the flight 3 hours, then loaded us all onto a bus to ‚Äútransport‚Äù us all to the airplane that was literally 50ft away. When they loaded us onto a cramped bus after waiting in line for 3 hours, they didn‚Äôt actually move the bus for another 30 mins. I literally could have crawled on my hands and knees from where the bus was to where the air plane was in probably 1 min - maybe less. They never should have even scanned our boarding passes unless the plane was ready to go because then we couldn‚Äôt even leave the line to use the bathroom or get food without handing a staff member our passport to hold - which at that point I would never trust any of the Air France staff to hold my passport for even 5 mins. We missed our connecting flight to Seattle and had to stay the night in Paris which isn‚Äôt as romantic as it sounds. They barely served any water on the 10 hour flight back to Seattle. Upon arriving in Seattle on a Thursday (to no surprise) some of our luggage was missing. Air France said they would deliver the missing luggage to our home within 24 hours. After several follows and Air France telling us they put the luggage and 4 different planes, to only admit it actually didn‚Äôt get on any of the planes, they told us on SUNDAY that they didn‚Äôt know where the luggage was, what country it was even in, but that ‚Äúrest assured they would email us when it‚Äôs on the way.‚Äù We called Delta to complain and then within 5 mins they located the bag and said it had arrived in Seattle on Friday and had been sitting there since then. They said they would have some staff from Air France ship it to which we said absolutely not and that we would just drive to the airport to get it ourselves because we didn‚Äôt want them touching our stuff anymore. 

If I could give this airline less than a 1 star I would. They completely took away from the refreshed and elated feeling you get from taking time off work and coming back from vacation. Rather than relaxing and resetting to our normal routines we went on a wild goose chase basically just to locate luggage that they couldn‚Äôt even pinpoint what country it was in when it was literally sitting at the airport 30 mins away from us.",2024-05,2024-05-06,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

Racist older blonde white flight attendant (read description),Paris,Dallas,International,"I am a solo Asian-American female that visited Paris for the first time. On the return flight, I chose an aisle seat so that I could get served first. On the first flight the attendant ALWAYS asked the person sitting in aisle FIRST. The second flight there was a racist older white female flight attendant with braids.
What I found very discriminatory and racist was that the female flight attendant with the braids would ONLY ask the white lady passenger who sat in the middle seat FIRST what she wanted to eat or drink. She would ONLY greet her and her husband that sat by the window and never greet me.

I found this to be odd since I was sitting closest to her and I should have been asked first (As I observed in all my previous flights). The flight attendant would ONLY address that passenger as ""Madame"" which she never addressed me. The flight attendant would ONLY tell the white lady ""Merci."" When I told the flight attendant ""Thank you"" she said NOTHING TO ME. This is discriminatory behavior and should be addressed.

I have never been on a flight ever where they skipped the aisle person and asked the middle person FIRST. It's because the woman sitting in the middle seat was white and the flight attendant thought she was more important than I.

I am sitting in the aisle seat and making eye contact with the flight attendant, AND SHE BLANTANTLY IGNORED ME AND ONLY SERVED THE WOMAN IN THE MIDDLE SEAT BEFORE ME FIRST, THEN ASKED ME SECOND THAT IS DISCIMINATION EVERY SINGLE time they gave out drinks, breakfast and lunch.

She treated me like a second class citizen as if I were ""less than"" which is probably why she only asked the white lady what drink she wanted or food she wanted first even though she was in the middle seat. And yes, I was making eye contact and ready to give my order to her but she IGNORED ME. This is discrimination.

Horrible Experience- Pick Another Airline!,San Antonio,Naples,International,"Air France goes down as the worst airline I have ever flown with. Our family flies internationally multiple times per year and we have never had an experience like this. First, we booked extra leg room seats and paid extra for them($400) 6 months in advance. About a month before the trip, they moved our seats and separated me and my husband in the back of the plane(with no refund, mind you) due to ‚Äúoperational reasons‚Äù. We logged in to see all the seats are clearly open so their ‚Äúoperational reasons‚Äù were a lie. We moved them again and paid again to have the same seats. They then move us the day of check-in due to ‚Äúoperational reasons‚Äù and this time at least refund us(only for the second time, we have still not received a refund for the first time). We were not surprised to see someone else seated in our seats we paid for when we got on the plane (supposedly they give them to whoever they prefer). On top of that, they made us check in our carry on because they have the worst space for carry on luggage I have ever seen on any plane. The one they did allow us to carry on, we had to put many rows behind us due to having no space anywhere near our seats. We made it there to Naples to find out that our luggage did not make the flight and will be coming sometime the next day. 

The luggage may be Air France‚Äôs issue or our previous airline‚Äôs issue so I‚Äôll let that one slide. We got our luggage about 4 days into our trip. 

The biggest issue was on the way back. We checked in around 12:30 PM for our flight the next day at 12:35 PM. 8 hours later, my husband only receives an e-mail(mind you, they have our phone number, my email, and we both also have the app and we received no notifications) that our flight has been cancelled and we are rebooked on a flight 6 1/2 hours earlier!! They had also touched our ticket and thus our other airlines could no longer check us in for the other flights on our itinerary or even move other flights on our itinerary. This left us with a 6 hour layover that we could not change through Delta. We ended up not being able to sleep at all because we did not discover this change until midnight due to no notifications and had to immediately pack and leave our hotel.

When we arrived at our boarding gate, I was then pulled(on no sleep already!) aside for a second security check 20 minutes before take-off because they booked our tickets last minute and made us look suspicious since it was no longer a two way international ticket!!!

Please, if you have any regard for your travel, do not book Air France. They made a horrible end to our trip.",2024-04,2024-05-04,1.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0,5.0
A seat choice is no guarantee.,Paris,Houston,International,"So, I was separated from my wife and made to sit 2 rows from her on this flight.  Three months before, we were together but somehow, AF decided to separate us today.  The reason - my seat next her was blocked for some technical problem.  We boarded, sat down, and voila, some Frenchman takes the blocked seat.  Apparently, he was upgraded or was using points, so they elected for him to use the seat.  Apparently the audio was not working on that seat.    I asked them if they thought that was ""good business practices"" and of course, the flight manager, did not have a clue of what I was referring so.  Their customer rep , Mr. Concon said this after I flied a complaint ""A seat reservation does give a certain assurance, but unfortunately never implies a full guarantee for a specific seat. Even though we try to honour a preference, a re-assignment of seats can occur in the case of an aircraft change, group booking or due to safety measures.""

3 year assignment with frequent international and domestic flights,Chicago,Paris,International,"Unique situation:  a 3.5-year international assignment to France with monthly flights to the US. Selecting and sticking with an airline is a challenge. Here's why I started with Air France & Delta and switched to United for my 20+ international flights and 30+ flights inside the EU:
 1. Use Air France and Transavia side EU for holidays and business: not recommended, expensive, tired old planes that you get bussed to and climb a staircase to board
2. Enjoy better service and French food: sub-par, tons of attitude, language and culture barrier, and Unided staff will go above and beyond if you are nice to them. 
2.  Get to premier class fast and enjoy the perks: it takes WAY longer, and very unfriendly policies like
- locking the seat map 48-24hrs before check-in
- making passengers pay for things that come standard with United
- wiping out seat selection when changing aircraft 
- lounge access and flight availability are generally better with United

Will Fly with Emirates or Turkish AIrlines Next Time Around!,Dubai,Paris,International,"Air France is seriously pushing me to jetison my loyalty to their Flyinig Blue program with increasingly mediocre service, like that which I experienced between Dubai and Paris on AF655. The Sky Team lounge in Dubai is frankly disgusting--shabby, poorly located, and with really terrible food and cheap wines, low-grade alchol, etc. If Air France wants to compete against Emirates it sseriously needs to up its game.
   Aboard flight 655, the stewardesses did not greet passengers or hang their coats on boarding. The 'snack' served in lieu of dinner was frankly disgusting--a proper meal should have been an option in business class, and no further beverage service was offered after the meal was served. Breakfast was rushed, becuase the stewardesses waited too late to serve, and the one serving me had to be asked for bread and pastries and never bothered offering jam. These are details, but when you pay extra for business class you expect a much better level of service and amenities.
    Finally, Charles de Gaulle terminal 2E is one of the most disorganised and poorly designed air terminals in the world! Plus staff is aggressively rude. Next time I will fly Turkish Airlines or Emirates, both of which offer much much better business class than Air France, a company that has been ruined by obvious cost cutting everywhere.",2024-04,2024-04-30,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

A disappointing journey,Mumbai,Sao Paulo,International,"A Disappointing Journey

As an Iranian traveler, I recently had an unfortunate experience with Air France that left me feeling stressed, frustrated, and disheartened. Let me share my story in the hope that it serves as a cautionary tale for fellow passengers.

Booking Process and Lack of Transparency

When I booked my flight from Mumbai to S√£o Paulo via Paris and operated by eight France itself , I trusted Air France to provide a seamless journey. However, upon arriving at Mumbai airport, I was blindsided by the revelation that I couldn't proceed to S√£o Paulo through Paris due to a transit visa requirement. The shock and confusion were overwhelming. Here's where Air France fell short:

1. Misleading Information: Nowhere during the ticket booking process did Air France mention the need for a transit visa. As a result, I found myself stranded at the airport, unable to continue my journey.

2. Stress and Racism:
 The lack of clear communication caused immense stress. Moreover, I felt discriminated against, as if my nationality played a role in their decision. No passenger should endure such treatment.

Denied Boarding and Financial Loss

1. Denied Boarding: Air France left me with no choice but to cancel my ticket. Imagine the frustration of being at the airport, ready to fly, only to be turned away due to an oversight by the airline.

2. Inadequate Refund:
 To add insult to injury, the refund process was a nightmare. Out of the ‚Çπ 75360 I paid, I received a paltry ‚Çπ 4369 back. This discrepancy is entirely unjust and unacceptable.

Passenger Rights and EU 261

1. EU 261: 
As an EU-based airline, Air France is subject to EU 261 regulations. These rules protect passengers' rights in cases of flight disruptions, including denied boarding due to visa issues.

2. Compensation:
 I urge Air France to honor its obligations under EU 261. Compensation should not be a mere formality; it's a matter of fairness and respect for passengers.

What Air France Can Do

1. Transparency: Air France must improve transparency during the booking process. Clearly communicate visa requirements to passengers, ensuring they make informed decisions.

2. Fair Compensation: 
Refund policies should be fair and consistent. Passengers deserve more than a fraction of their hard-earned money back.

Conclusion

My experience with Air France was disheartening. I implore the airline to rectify its practices, treat passengers equitably, and uphold the standards expected of a reputable carrier.

Despicable Treatment of Air France Staff!,Paris,Johannesburg,International,"My recent experience with Air France left me deeply dissatisfied and frustrated. As a frequent business traveler, I value efficiency and respect for customers. Unfortunately, my encounter with Air France at Charles de Gaulle Airport was anything but.

After a long journey that involved multiple flights, I faced an unexpected hurdle at the Air France check-in counter. Despite my baggage being only slightly over the weight limit, I was met with arrogance and inflexibility from the staff. The ""manager"" on duty, accompanied by a dismissive colleague, insisted that I pay a hefty fee for a mere 1kg overweight in my hand luggage. When I suggested redistributing the weight within my checked baggage, I was met with a cold refusal.

The interaction took a disrespectful turn when, after mentioning my profession as a pilot, the staff openly laughed and made derogatory remarks in French. This unprofessional behavior continued when I tried to seek refuge in the Air France lounge during my long layover, only to be met with insincere hospitality and a thinly veiled acknowledgment of the prior encounter.

This experience has left me deeply disappointed in Air France's customer service and handling of situations. Not only was I subjected to unnecessary charges, but the staff's unprofessional conduct was disheartening. As a result, I will be avoiding Air France for my future travels and will not recommend their services to colleagues or friends.

Worst Airline experience,Paris,Cairo,International,"My companion, and I, Kamel Khalil, both elderly and with limited mobility, had a harrowing experience with Air France. After our original flight was canceled, we were left unattended for a grueling 24 hours at France's airport, confined to our wheelchairs. Despite our obvious need for assistance, no one from the airline bothered to check on us or offer any help. To make matters worse, the atmosphere at the airport was dismal, with staff displaying blatant racism and mistreatment towards us. This entire ordeal was not only physically exhausting but also emotionally draining. We argued many times that we were already sick and walking with oxygen machines, but our pleas were ignored. We spent the entire night in misery, with nowhere to rest. Since returning from this trip, both my companion and I have been battling pneumonia, which we believe was exacerbated by the neglect and mistreatment we endured. We strongly advise against using Air France or France's airport. The lack of basic human decency and respect shown by both entities is appalling.

Pack light... REALLY light.,Washington DC,Dar es Salaam,International,"I typically don't leave negative reviews of airlines even though I've had a fair few bad experiences, because... what's the point? But I have to share this experience with Air France which was so bad from check-in that I wanted to skip my trip altogether. 

Upon arrival, they notified me of a strict carry-on bag weight policy (26.4 pounds). Having been unaware of this, I spent an hour shuffling and re-arranging so as to check my backpack and keep my larger bag. Satisfied, they let me pass to security, sans backpack. 

Once at the gate, a gate attendant randomly selected me to be pulled aside for a check. He lifted my bag with his bare hand and proclaimed it to be too heavy. I objected, as I had made it through check-in and he was not using an instrument to measure. Another attendant brought over a baggage scale and concurred that it was too heavy, not showing me what the reading on the scale was. I resorted to shoving my multiple medications, travel chargers, laptop, business papers, valuables, and a few toiletries into a shopping bag to bring on board. When I asked if the contents of my carry-ons would be reimbursed in full if they did not arrive at my destination, the attendant shrugged and said I'd have to call the company and ask.

Buyer beware: If you choose this airline, don't pack anything of value that can't fit into a pocket. You may not be able to bring it on board.

Delayed by 9 hours 45 minutes on return from Paris to Birmingham, due to departure staff simply saying they had no idea when the flight may depart from Paris as they had no flight crew available.

A Truly Awful Flying Experience - Pick ANY other Airline if you can.,Paris,Boston,International,"- The Better Business Bureaus rates this firm as ""F"" due to unresolved customer complaints and I can easily see why.
- They had our plane on the ground for 8 hours before finally, at boarding time, deciding to do a systems check.  As we all stood around waiting to board, we got several announcements about ""boarding shortly"", none of which were true. For three hours, there was no communication from AirFrance as to what was going on.
- Then we were finally told that we would be getting a different plane at a different terminal and had to schlep ourselves on the tram to the new terminal and find our own way.  No help was available from AirFrance employees, who, even when I asked one point blank to his face just ignored me as if he did not see me and that I had not spoken. Incredibly Rude.
- We finally got on the plane after a 4 1/2 hour delay only to find they had not finished prepping the second plane (to get ""fresher food""), so we sat on the tarmac for another 30 minutes. 
- Our 1:25 PM flight FINALLY left at 6:00PM.
- On this flight, we found that the ""fresher food"" did not include anywhere near enough portions, so approx 40% of the plane had to settle for whatever they had.
And what they had was wretched!! I just threw mine away after a taste because it was just awful.
- The second ""meal""/""snack"" was also inedible and looked like rejects from a very cheap restaurant. Tossed that one, too.
- So, no food on this flight.
- The flight announcements in French came first (Ok), and were always considerably longer that the ones in English that followed.  And the ""English"" was SO bad that the announcements (which, who knows, might have contained valuable info) were mainly incomprehensible. Not just me - we were all looking at each other and asking ""Did YOU understand that?""
- Considering this plane contained mainly US tourists returning from France, they really should have at least looked for someone for whom English was not such an insurmountable challenge!  What if we could not understand important safety info?  Does the FAA know or care about this? Or have any jurisdiction?
- The flight attendants displayed a clear bias in looking down their noses at us Americans, and deliberately either misunderstanding what we said, or simply ignoring us entirely.  They clearly thought this level of contempt was acceptable, for some reason.

Use Apple Air Tags and Don't Trust AFrance to deliver your luggage,Paris,Washington DC,International,"This was my second Business Class trip to France from DC in 5 months (my first international travel since 2020). 

This past week, 4/5, at CDG, my husband and I each checked one (normal sized) suitcase at the counter. The flight from CGD was not good - a screaming child in the middle seat next to me for 8 hours. Then, at Dulles in DC, at the luggage carousel, my husband's suitcase comes out. But mine never does. We stood for one hour waiting; mine never arrived. 

Turns out, it never got put on the plane in France. The crew knew the whole 8 hours and never told me. Neither my age (70) nor my flight cabin (business class) mattered to them. They let a 70-year old woman stand at the carousel for an hour for NO good reason. So much for respect for their customers.

We had Apple Air Tags in both checked suitcases. So that night and the next morning we called Air France. They finally admitted it had been put on a Delta flight to Detroit and then made it to Dulles Friday morning. They offered to hire a 3rd party to bring it to our home a few days later.  We said, ""no thanks""; my husband went to pick it up that morning. But they neglected to tell him that their office doesn't open/isn't staffed until 1pm. While he was going there, I called AF and got a similar runaround from a person who probably isn't even an AF employee. He had zero interest in rectifying their error and in solving the problem in a timely, decent way. 

At the luggage claim office, AF insisted it was not at Dulles and we'd have to wait for an email later to say when it might arrive. Despite his telling them our Air Tag proved it was quite close to their luggage office. (I had the same experience on the phone - AFrance rudely asked why my husband went to the airport since he hadn't received an email saying the bag was there. I replied, ""Because that's where the bag is, the Air Tag proves it"".) 

Turns out my bag was at the Delta Luggage Office, right next to AFrance's. My husband went next door. The office was open, lights off, no one there. He found the bag in plain sight. (think about the potential thefts). 

He then walked back to Air France next door and gave them the courtesy of showing them my bag, saying the Air Tag was right all along. They closed the luggage ticket and he came home, four hours later. In all our contacts with AF, they never once apologized or accepted any responsibility for handing this very poorly. 
 
Lesson: Airlines are bureaucratic messes. They truly don't care about their customers. Use Apple Air Tags. Be assertive about getting your luggage back. I had several gifts and other valuable items in that bag. I'm just grateful it wasn't stolen while it was sitting right next to Air France in their ""partner"" office.",2024-04,2024-04-07,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0

Air France business class at CDG,Paris,Los Angeles,International,"While the flight itself was reasonably on-time considering the rainy weather, the overall business class experience bordered on miserable due to AF ground operations at CDG Terminal 2E.   Just about everything was poor following Sky-Priority checkin, including an unimpressive Sky-Priority lounge. 
Finding the almost-hidden entry to the Sky-Priority security lane nestled between postions 7 and 8 was a challenge. Next, all three non-EU electronic passport stations were not working because the software kept rebooting.  Staff redirected passengers to a long manual queue.   The x-ray line was overcrowded and understaffed contributing to more delays.  But the worst part was learning that the flight would use a bus gate at K52 to take passengers to a plane parked at another terminal.  Jammed into busses, both business and economy passengers  endured a 15 minute ride to the plane only to have to walk up three flights of stairs with their carry-on baggage.  After a long wait on an overcrowded jetway to the plane, exhausted sweaty customers were greeted by sympathetic flight crew who promised that the flight itself would be better which it was.

Having flown business class for the last 5 years, I was genuinely shocked when I was refused access to the lounge because I had purchased a ""Business light fare"". I have never heard of such a thing and certainly wasn't made aware of this at booking. The staff were adamant that it was clear on their website. The only problem was, I didn't book directly through the AF website. I can assure you there was no mention on the site of this fare and there was also no mention of it on the AF app or emails. The only place it could be found was in small print on the boarding pass. 

What a terrible idea to introduce this product and not make it very clear to anyone purchasing it that it was a different fare. To rub salt into the wound, I had to pay for seat selection and lounge access.

"Worst customer service ever, lost bag with no news nor updates form the airlines",Dubai,Ottawa,International,"I had the worst experience with Air France, I had a lost baggage (the ground hostess made me check in my carry on bag ) I did and then arrived to Ottawa. This particular bag didn‚Äôt arrive. It‚Äôs not what is the worst in this experience. A week after I filed a complaint at the airport, I still hadn‚Äôt received an update from them , no news at all!!! I called them had to wait almost an hour to get to an agent. The lady who answered told me to add the info about what‚Äôs in my bag. So I had again to fill another form (2nd one) to enumerate the items in my bag. It‚Äôs been another week now and still no news from them. They are the worst customer services airline I ever dealt with! Really a shame, I used to like Air France, I really hope that people will read this and understand that they cannot be trusted. The worst part is that if I don‚Äôt get my bag in 21 days I have to fill a 3rd form to get an indemnity for my lost bag. Unacceptable",2024-03,2024-03-29,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0

Unsure if it‚Äôs Discrimination or Ignorance,New York City,Paris,International,"Let me first begin by saying if anyone knows who i can report this airline to for what im about to write beyond a review please chime in because i am not giving up until they make things right or I exhaust all channels. But Diamond members with Skyteam apparently mean nothing. Stick with delta because they show us no consideration. 

My trip actually began in DC, i took a delta airlines flight to JFK and no problems until it was time to leave for Paris. I get to the gate an am asked for my Visa for Kenya. I informed the gate agent it was all over the news that visas were not required anymore. For 45 minutes I went back and forth showing how other passengers where able to travel prior to me with no problems, and how on previous flights with AF and even KLM I‚Äôve traveled with no visa in the past. Nope still not able to board and when i even checked my bag location i found they already removed my luggage meaning they already selected me to not board. I had already paid for upgraded seats and had important business to get to in Nairobi. 

I am told i need to leave the area and see ticketing, they say we can rebook you tomorrow, but if you denied me today wouldn‚Äôt it be the same tomorrow? Or was it another reason I couldn‚Äôt travel? I tell the lady send me to Tanzania, i have an active multi visa there so this doesn‚Äôt happen tomorrow. And i book a one way from there myself on Kenya airways to Nairobi. 

I call the complaint customer service line and all they do is keep saying it‚Äôs my fault, nobody at the airline took ownership. I arrived on a connecting flight 5 hour in advance i wont late. So im stuck in NY and had to get a hotel, my bags were somewhere in the airport and i was told they would be on the plane when i left the next morning it was confirmed. I track them and they never left NY. I get to Amsterdam and they say i have to file a complaint at my final destination. 

I eventually arrive in Tanzania and with no issues whatsoever board my flight to Kenya meaning this was all for nothing but a waste of my time money and resources. 

When i arrive in Kenya i file my bag claim and they arrive 3 days late, damaged and destroyed. 

I was in Kenya a month so until i returned to the US i had to wait to address my concerns more vigorously. I attempted to dispute the seat upgrades i never received with no success. I attempted to recover my extra flight with Kenya airlines with no success. I also tried to recover the damaged costs for my bags and as of yesterday was told (even though Kenya airways is Skyteam) it had to be a KLM DELTA AF claim with made 0 sense. The report was received and you sent my bags on an AF flight the claim made no impact of my situation. 

So to date i was told you are welcome to fly on another AF flight and get your seat credit (after you buy another ticket and spend more money) I would rather change airlines and develop status and loyalty with another airline before i travel on another AF flight. 

Now the above are 100% the fault of AF. I have no doubt in my mind they were oversold and are covering up this fact and involuntarily tried bumping my seat and are not taking ownership for this issue. So my message to anyone reading this, the above statements are factual. I had everything, was on time, the airline didn‚Äôt let me travel and as a result caused a lot of issues with my travel. I missed interviews, meetings and wasted money on travel and expenses extra. Have destroyed luggage, a credit supposedly that isn‚Äôt showing that will never get used (but if they are not at fault why do i have a credit) Be careful when booking with this specific airline. The way they handled me when they were responsible for the entire experience above could be you. I was fortunate to have major credit cards and able to buy tickets, hotels etc. other people in recent times were stuck at airports at the airlines mercy. 

I say avoid this airline since responsibility seems to be against its practice. They were unprofessional with how they treated me and offered no resolution but you can fly again with us. 

Why would you want to if you are treated this way! Please think before you book my friends.",2024-01,2024-03-28,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
Average service. Had to check in the carry on.,Vancouver,Paris,International,"I booked the flight 6 months in advance. In 2 months - 4 months before departure - Air France cancelled both my out and return flights. I had to move everything one day forward. Called customer service and got free luggage and free seat selection.Booked exit row for free.- was nice. At checkin in YVR - we were really harassed by the agent to check in the carryons - because we had the cheapest tickets, carry ons are not guaranteed in the cabin. And there is a weight limit of 12 kg for all cabin items. Had to give up, repack and check in one carry on, which left me with just a small personal item. Fortunately, all items made to Paris. On a return flight from Paris - noone asked us to weight the carry ons and check them in. Food was not exciting at all - Cathay Pacific and Fiji Airways are better.

Seating switched,Paris,Newark,International,"I had booked an extra legroom, aisle seat and paid the fee.  I was one of the last to board due to an extremely long wait at security and found my seat was already occupied.

The flight attendant then told me I could sit in the middle seat on the opposite side of the plane but I refused.  She then tried to move the aisle person to the middle seat and he refused.  She then told me to sit in a regular economy aisle seat and I asked how I could get my refund for the extra fee I had already paid. After some discussion in French with another attendant, they finally moved everyone to their assigned seats.  I cannot understand why they moved passengers who had preselected seats around to accommodate the couple and why they didn‚Äôt just have everyone sit where specified on their boarding passes.

"Bad experience with AF253 flight on Sunday March 24, 2024.",Ho Chi Minh City,Paris,International,"I had quite an unpleasant experience with AF253 originated from SGN on Sunday March 24, 2024.  To start with, the flight was delayed for more than 2 hours.  As we got off the ground, AF service was very infrequent.  During the 13-hour flight from HCM to Paris, AF253 crew served the economy passengers 5 (five) times: 2 for meals (not very good) & drinks and 3 for just drinks.  I called for service via their Boeing 777' touch screen TWICE and no one ever responded.  I had to flag down one of the crew members to ask for a cup of hot chocolate.  To that gentleman's credit, he brought me two (2) cups (don't know why) of hot chocolate instead of one (1).  
AF253 crew appears to be spending more time in the back of the plane conversing with each other than checking on the economy passengers.

Worst airline with the worst customer service,Johannesburg,Dallas,International,"Air France is the worst airline I have ever had the misfortune to travel upon.

WORST AIRLINES EVER‚Ä¶.. VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE‚Ä¶..,Atlanta,Chennai (Madras),International,"WORST AIRLINES EVER‚Ä¶.. VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE‚Ä¶..

I initially booked (booking reference: MAKWAQ) my flight and couldn't travel due to personal reasons. Thus, the ticket was put as an open ticket so i can rebook in a year using the same ticket.

Then i decided my travel dates and contacted air france (call took 1 hr+ (30 mins to connect and 30+mins to discuss with agent)) to book the flight on 1/9/2024 (booking reference:R386SH) and the fair was $4400.00. The agent said they need to send a manual calculation (what difference needs to be paid) and I will receive an email within 12 - 48 hrs. I waited and never received an email as mentioned. I asked if my ticket price would change and they said ""NO"".
Then I again called on 1/12 (call took 1.30 hr+ (45 mins to connect and 30+mins to discuss with agent)) and was told the same. Need to do the manual calculation by a different team and I will receive the email in 12-48hrs. I again asked if my price will change and they said ""NO"". It should be recorded in our call. But never received an email.
So, I called them again (1/15) , which took 2.30hrs (1 hr to connect and then 1 + hr discussion) and suddenly was told the ticket fair went up and I need to pay $3500 more, which is $2300 to $2500 more from my initial cost. So I was requesting to connect to the manager for further discussion as I am not responsible to pay the increase in fare because the fault was not on me. The fault was on the air France team as they did not do the manual calculation in a timely manner as they said which caused this increase in fare, even after me calling multiple times to get an update. And was about to request to book the flight for the same cost ($4400) or request a refund as this is clearly air france responsibility. After 2 hrs of call, the agent disconnected the call and never called me back which is the worst service i have ever experienced.

I ended up using different airlines as I cannot relay and trust Air France anymore. 

The customer care representative informed me to raise a refund/claim through the website as they cannot do. I did raise a claim and got a reply saying contact customer care number.

Poor customer service overall  for Air France,Paris,Havana,International,"Recently travel with Air France.
Think again when flying with this air line, thought being a nation
airline their service would be good, how wrong.
Booked our flights back in September 23 for our flights to Havana. Which included extra leg room, which we paid extra fees for,  as one of our party had back and leg issues and needed the extra room. 
However when we got our tickets a week before our flights in March 24, found out our seats had been changed and we had lost our extra leg room, tried to contact Air France customer service, first service agent was not bothered about the issue and fobbed us off.
 Rang again and appeared to be getting some where with another advisor and was promised a call back in 24- 48 hrs, guess what, no call back, called again and told still being reviewed, they will call you in 24 hrs, quess what still no call back, rung again and spoke to customer service and was basically told no extra leg room seats left and that we would have to accept it, asked to speak to a supervisor, was told couldn‚Äôt  do that. Then I enquired what seats we did have, told our party was now split over the plane, after much discussion managed to get 4 seats close together. This was same issue for both legs of flight outbound and inward bound flights?? 
Issues didn‚Äôt stop there. The service we received on flight from the crew was a lot to be desired, our flight was a day time flight for 10hrs, the crew rushed food out at start of flight and then put lights down as if to keep the passengers quite?? Then didn‚Äôt get any other food or drink until an hour before landing, when we asked for a drink mid flight was more or less told sort yourselves out??

"Great, as long as you don't have pets or checked bags!",Chicago,Bologna,International,"I called Air France BEFORE I booked my flight to enquire specifcally about traveling with a dog and 2 cats, and I was told that I could fly with 2 pets in hold and 1 in cabin. So, I booked the flight. Then they canceled the pet request because the layover was not long enough. So, the agent books a different flight, and they cancelled that one because the plane on one leg of the flight did not allow more than one pet in hold. After literally 20 phone calls, and 20 hours of my time attempting to book a flight with my pets, it occurred to me that there are zero flights from Chicago to Turin that will accomodate them. I asked if there were any flights to any nearby airports, and the agents were unable to find even one. I asked for a refund, due to my being given false information regarding travel with pets on this route, they refused, because the 1k flight was non-refundable. I ended up asking which type plane allows more than one pet, and I was able to research and find a flight myself, going into Bologna..... a 5-6 hour drive from where I needed to be. Also keep in mind, when traveling with pets, you must remove your them from the carrier goong through security, or put them through an x-ray machine designed for non-living items. However in Paris, unlike other airports, they do not have a room to remove your pets in, so if your cat doesn't appreciate going back in the carrier, good luck. Luckily my cat ultimately was more afraid of the airport, than he was the carrier, so I only had a few scratches. Then, upon attempting to board the second leg of the flight in Paris, they weighed my carry on PLUS my purse together, and was told it was 1kg to heavy, and I needed to check the carry-on bag.  Except the bag contained a 3k camera and 2k worth of medication, and all my pet supplies, none of which I could ditch. I asked them to document the expensive contents and was told the medicine and pet supplies would be okay, but it would be best not to check the camera. So clearly they are aware their own employees are thieves, and they still work there? Finally a manager came out and made an exception for me to carry it in cabin. However, this process took so long, I missed the connecting flight. So, they had to remove my 60 pound dog and my cat, that were already checked into cargo, and I had to wait in the airport with all 3 of them for an additional 4 hours until the next flight. Of course, they tried to charge me a flight change fee, but as my voice got louder, they decided to do me a huge favor and waive that. Now, I land in Bologna at 23:30, and the rental car was closed, so not only did I pay a day for a rental car that I didn't have, I had to take a $100 cab to a $200 hotel room, then another $100 cab back to the airport in the morning to rent a car, for my 5 hour drive to Turin with 3 animals. On top of this, one of my checked bags didn't make it to Bologna. I suppose I should be grateful they even found it. I received an email on 5 March, stating my bag arrived at Bologna airport. I made arrangments for it to be delivered on 10 March, because although my daughter lives in Bologna and could pick it up, we would still have to get it to Torino. After waiting all day, the bag did not arrive. So, I called Air France to see why it wasn't delivered, and was told my bag was enroute to Bologna from Paris? Then the next day, they told me it did actually arrive on the 5th, so I asked them again to deliver it. They told me they handed it to ONX courier, who will contact me. It us now 14 March, and no word from the courier. I had asked for the courier phone number, and they gave me 2 numbers, one of which is out of service, and one they don't answer. AF refuses to give me an email so that I can contact the company myself, but assured me they would email them, but today they told me the company never responded to the email. So, today 14 March, I called AF and asked that they get my bag back from the courier, and I will take a day to go to Bologna to retrieve it there. Of course, they again emailed the company that clearly has zero employees to answer it. It won't long before it can be deemed lost. Been there, and anyone who has been there can tell you this will entail hours locating receipts and making spreadsheets, only to be told the value of your items are 1/10 of what it would cost to replace them, and if you don't have receipts, you are out of luck (because you know everyone just wants to rip off these honest, ethical airlines when THEY lose YOUR luggage). Bottom line, I am sure this is a perfectly fine Airline to fly international, as long as you do not have pets or checked baggage, as their agents are ill-informed regarding pets, and even if they find your bag after they lost it, they will hand it to a courier that doesn't deliver your bag, answer their phone, or respond emails. After this total nightmare, where my poor cats were traumatized after being crated for 24 hours in urine soaked carriers (I uploaded a photo of one of them, around hour 20), I realize I would have literally saved 50 hours of time, and 1k, had I simply re-booked with a different airline,  cancelling the Air France flight all together, with no refund.",2024-03,2024-03-15,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0
"Four flights with Air France, only the long distance flight was any good.",Edinburgh,Toulouse,Europe,"The flight was late leaving EDI. The co-pilot appeared to be arguing with ground staff about some problem. This may not have been the airline's fault. Ground crew re positioned air-stairs and eventually we boarded. The plane interior was averagely clean. Disappointing after Emirates and Etihad.
When the back wheels touched the runway in CDG it occurred to me that the nose was still high. Sure enough, the pilot aborted landing and we had to go around.
This may well have been the best and safest thing to do but it meant we lost 20 minutes. This meant out time on the ground was shorter than planned to make out connecting flight..
Our bags, despite being business priority missed the connecting AF flight to Toulouse. It was around lunchtime so maybe ground crew went on lunch.  AF service in TLS was non-existent. Worked my way around entering a contactless form into a terminal. Got an email late in the day saying our bags are on the way late that night and would be available for collection the following day after 9am. I went back to the terminal, after 9 the following morning and was advised by staff that the bags were due in TLS later that day. They insisted the email I had received was wrong.  Lucky I had Apple Airtags in the bags and the airtags were in the terminal. The staff member invited me into the next room and there were our 3 bags. Along with about 100 others.
If I hadn't had airtags I would have been sent away to wait another day.
This is the first flight I have ever had in my life with lost luggage.
The AF service was very poor.
When I spoke to French friends, they told me lost luggage in CDG transfers were very common and they called it Air Chance. Given that both flights were in and out of Terminal 2 at CDG the bags didn't have to go far yet they didn't make it on time.
No apology has ever been received from AF.
Not happy and not likely to use AF again if there is a connecting flight.",2024-03,2024-03-15,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0

Avoid Air France at all cost,Montreal,Bengaluru,International,"I just finished an absolutely horrible experience flying to and from India with Air France.

They decided to route me through Dubai and when I arrived (8 hours later than scheduled) I lost money on my hotel and my bags were delayed for 2 days. Not a word from Air France.  Then on my return, there was a delay on my flight from India to Paris, so they unilaterally decided to route me through SINGAPORE which not only added 20 hours to my flight, but meant that I would miss my connecting flight home to Halifax. Again, not one word from Air France with an offer of assistance or even apology. Finally - today when I sought a claim to compensate for the hundreds of dollars lost AT THEIR EXPENSE - Air France denied any responsibility or compensation because of some obscure law that says my flight was not within the EU so they gave me the middle finger for all my discomfort.

2. I had paid in advance and designated a seat. But they changed seats on their own without prior notice. The reason was that the seat I bought was originally not for sale. Then, they assigned me a broken seat that doesn't fit backwards. I sat at 90 degrees during a long flight and came uncomfortable. I asked the customer service center, but I received only a partial response that a refund was not possible. Why did you get an additional fee?

I was dehydrated and when I asked for water, I was informed to go to the kitchenette and help myself to drinks. When I got there were no cups and they were out of water. I was so sick by the time the flight was over. 

on arriving upon my destination in Portugal, my combination lock had been tampered with and I couldn't open my luggage. I'm not sure why that would happen with a TSA approved lock. ? Also, my friend's luggage was slashed with a knife. 

Upon our return flight - My friend was hit with 500 euros in order to board the flight, even though she had already paid for her flights in full.

Upon argument I was denied to board and denied to give new tickets (I felt racial discrimination) we were not given hotel accommodation either. Without internet and night time we could not able to book any hotel by ourself and end up staying at airport. When we landed to Houston airport; our two of 6 bags arrived damaged and 1 is still missing. I have recorded behaviour of the customer care agent who sent us out of terminal to buy or get a free ticket and we came out of terminal with all 3 passengers passport with keeping 66 year old my mother in side terminal which makes her exit to Paris difficult which turns into involvement of airport security involvement. I am still waiting for my bag. Airport mentioned that it will come there then they ll send me here. No one has called me yet.

In-bound there was a global failure of all IFE, call bells and in-seat power on a 13 hour flight. Were told that the IFE failure have been notified before boarding, but it had not. Were told that Business seats would get personal iPads, but that was not true either. 
At 24hours notice the schedule was deferred by 3.5 hours, yet AF issued what I view as a false ""certificate"" stating the inbound arrival was only 11 minutes late. Presumably to dodge EU compensation claims. 
Food out-bound from CDG was good but very widely-spaced. Only two offerings in 14 hours. Snacks effectively non-existent, so bring your own. No icecream served. No free-flow Business Class alcohol. Only two regular drink rounds in 14 hours.....so can this really be considered a premium French airline? 
If you want just another short-changing unreliable airline then chose Air France......NEVER AGAIN",2024-02,2024-02-23,1.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,2.0

Slouching towards mediocrity to save a few centimes!,Bangkok,Paris,International,"Air France is rapidly becoming a very mediocre airline due to an obsessive focus on bottom-line over customer satisfaction. They no longer have individual bottles of mineral water in the Business Class lounge, pretending that this is for environmental reasons, when it's obviously a way to save money. The food in their Business Class lounges is barely edible and staff are unhelpful and unfriendly in Paris. Bangkok Business Class Lounge was truly awful, too. And food quality in flight has become poor as well. Plane was not very clean, and they didn't leave a refreshment cart in the galleys like they used to. Service on my most recent flight was rushed, impersonal and completely charmless. More interested in the bottom-line than customer satisfaction, this once great airline is no longer one I would recommend (Instead I fly Turkish or any of the Gulf carriers instead).",2024-02,2024-02-22,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0

The service throughout the flight on all 4 flights was great, but the flight from Paris to Seattle was superb.

Air France - where passengers are an inconvenient necessity,Paris,Newcastle upon Tyne,Europe,"Air France would prefer it, if you buy the tickets but don't actually turn up. 

Passengers are such an inconvenience, and really should be placed in the hold to prevent the Air France staff from having to interact with third rate people - aka customers.

Unbearable Experience with Air France,Chicago,Aalborg,International,"I can't express my frustration enough with the ongoing battle my group of 25 has had with Air France over the last five months. We've tirelessly pursued compensation for flight cancellations and delays, as per Regulation (EC) No. 261/2004, only to be met with complete silence from the airline.

To add insult to injury, when our flight was canceled, Air France conveniently blamed it on a shortage of personnel at the arrival airport. However, despite repeated requests, they refuse to provide any evidence to substantiate their claim. It's infuriating to think they can brush off their responsibilities without any accountability.

The lack of communication and transparency from Air France is unacceptable. We've followed all the proper channels, but the airline seems to have no regard for passenger rights or customer service. The indifference displayed by Air France throughout this ordeal is disheartening, and I feel compelled to share my experience to caution others.

Shockingly rude cabin crew!  An unforgettable experience resulting in me ending my over 30 years flying with Air France.,Paris,Osaka,International,"Myself and  the passengers next to me were very rudely and unnecessarily shouted at by cabin crew.  I was sitting beside a lovely Spanish man and Japanese elderly lady. 
We began to have a little chat about Japan because it was the Spanish man's first time there.  While enjoying a glass of wine each we talked.   We were about 1 hour into our flight. Suddenly without warning or appropriate reason the flight attendant shouted at us to shut up talking.  His words were ""I can hear you from premium economy (we were on the next isle) and if you don't be quiet I'll take away your drinks.""  
All three of us sat with our mouths open in pure amazement at what had happen.  After the flight attendant left we laughed and I remarked ""I guess this is a non smoking and non talking flight"".   We figured we better end our pleasantries and enjoy some onboard entertainment in silence for the rest of the flight.
This kind of behaviour is unacceptable.
If I was the head purser I would advise my crew to first engage with a customer and ask them kindly to reduce the volume of their voices for the benefit of the other passengers.  (Even though our volume was perfectly normal and respectable)
If that was not enough and the passengers continued to speak in a loud disruptive manor I would advise a second warning to reiterate the issue.
And only then if there was a third instance would it be necessary to become irate with the passenger and threaten to remove the supposed cause of the volume (this time being a glass of wine).
I have flown Air France regularly for over 30 years between Japan and Europe.  After this flight it has left such a bad impression that I will never fly with them again out of principal. From now on I'll chose Emirates or Qatar.  Shame on you Air France!  It may only have been only one stressed out over worked staff member but as they say 'one bad egg can rot the whole barrel.'

Air France amateur baggage allowance system. Exorbitant fees.,Nice,Paris,Domestic,"Air France as a national carrier are an absolute embarrasment. They are more amateur than low-cost carriers like Easy Jet.

They charge you an exorbitant amount of money if you are over the 23kg wieght limit for Economy. Surely in this day and age when we know that most people flying international have a weight limit of 32kgs. ie Emirates. Im naturally going to need the same allowance if im taking domestic flights ie Nice to Paris.

But Air France dont allow you to choose 32kgs when making a booking for economy, only 23kgs. On their website it says:
""You can travel with a bag that weighs more than the baggage weight included in your ticket, so long as it does not exceed 32 kg. The price of an Overweight Baggage option depends on your booking and must be paid for at the airport.""

So let me choose 32kg during the booking then? Or do you just want to charge me 100 Euros at the airport when I have no choice??

- Senior agent was understanding. 

NEGATIVE EXPERIENCES:
-The baggage handling is done by a third party agency, not Air France. 
- They have segregated the line for India passengers to one separate line.
- The junior agents are rude and hasty.
- Even when a bag is over by just 1 or 2 kgs, the agents will refuse to take the bag and make the passenger open this bag at the counter and remove items  to cater it to exactly 23 kgs as per their scales.
- Does Air France claim that their vendor operated scales are perfectly calibrated and that they do not have an error of even one kg?
- When they refuse a bag, then will Air France accept a lawsuit from passengers when they were harassed by refusal of a bag when it was over by just one kg? 
- I will urge all passengers to bring a professionally weighed bag and if it is showing overweight at the Air France counter, then they should sue AF  in a class lawsuit for harassing all the passengers that have had to endure the rude treatment of their baggage agents. 
- Air France baggage handlers treat people of Indian origin with lesser courtesy than they treat their other passengers.
- It was clearly noticeable that the African American lady agent was not happy with serving the Indian customers with equality and respect. 
- The black lady agent refused to accept that the extras bag fees were already paid and harassing us to produce a receipt at the airport counter when it was clearly listed on the AF formal itinerary what our bag limit was. 

Air France need to treat customers traveling to India and back to other countries with much better respect and fairness and we lenient with certain aspect of weight which can be an error on their machine unless they want to claim that they have no scope of weight discrepancy in their scales. 

I would like to hear from her Air France representative why such behaviors exist in their staff or vendors that they choose as their operators, and what they will do to rectify such RECURRING BAD EXPERIENCES.",2024-02,2024-02-05,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,3.0
DELAYED BAGGAGE : TIPS TO CLAIM A REFUND,Toronto,Cape Town Central,International,"DELAYED LUGGAGE appears to be a common occurrence on AF. 
We travel extensively and this is the first time ever, that we had delayed luggage and damaged   Three bags delayed; sent to different destinations and arrived  on separate days.

We were not comfortable with the lack of information and  are happy that we trusted our instincts and purchased only a few items for my husband. Check AF website for information.

AirFrance high punishment on passenger and not taking complaint seriously.,Paris,Shanghai,International,"I have air&rail ticketfrom Brussels to Shanghai via Paris. I did online checkin before departing and the check-in was confirmed with assigned seat number. Then I took a local train in Belgium to go to Brussels. At the Brussels, I was accepted to get on board to the TGV train to Paris and be seated on my assigned seat. During the whole train trip, no one come to check the ticket again. When arrived at Paris airport, at the ticket office, I was suspected as a cheater that not really coming from Brussels by train. During argument, one employee at ticket office made mocking on me that ""you were definitely not coming by train because on the platform there is always a AirFrance staff there, and you should consider it  as a flight thus you should reach out to a AirFrance staff but not a railway staff...."", and showing the small AirFrance logo pinned in front of her uniform. However, she also gave a solution to charge me 500 Euro for adjustment. I feel mocked and could not agree with the solution. So I called the supervisor. The supervisor came asking me to show the evidence that I took that train. I showed the selfie photo I took on the train with shooting time and a TGV logo but was doubted and not accepted. The supervisor suggested me either accept to pay 500 Euro or miss the boarding, by putting me under time pressure reminding me the 10, 5 or 2 minutes remaining to make the decision. I was pushed to pay 500 Euro and rushed to go through security check and boarding. However, when got on boarded, I found my seat confirmed during online check-in was no available and had to wait for a while for the boarding stuff to find a new seat for me in the last row. Afterwards I did a online complaint via AirFrance , waiting for more than one month, and finally  got a ridiculous answer, they said ""the disrupted segment was operated by train (SNCF/Thalys). Since, the segment was operated by train, please allow us to inform you that this is a situation where there is no entitlement to compensation. ""  Seems they did not take claim seriously because even you notice it is a travel from Paris to Shanghai, it can not be a railway service. In the end, I would have to say, be super careful when taking ""Air&Rail"" service of AirFrance. You may run into a high punishment (500 Euro) at the airport to continue your travel. And if you trust what they said like ""you can claim it back afterwards"", then whish you good luck.",2023-12,2024-02-04,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
"Airfrance is a criminal airline, human right abusers",Ho Chi Minh City,Birmingham,International,"Airfrance is basically a criminal airline. They cancelled my flight on the 5th of January 2024 during boarding saying i needed to have some form of visa to transit via France.

 I explained to them that no one informed me of this and even if they were correct, why did they accept my payment without first checking i have the transit visa for France. It is my first time being denied boarding for something as little as having a transit visa, ever since i started flying. Now they have refused to refund me even though i spent my last pence on the alternative flight. 
Bear in mind that on 3rd of January, 2024, I was not able to fly through the same airline for some immigration issue. Why did the airline official at the counter not let me know about the transit visa issue in case i rebook another flight with them? 
This issue could have been avoided if they told me when i presented my passport on the 3rd of January, that i didn't have a transit visa too so i couldn't even fly even if there was no immigration issue. 

But instead, the official kept quiet and never said anything regarding that. So i rebooked with the same airline, assuming i have all the documents required only to be turned away on the travel day (5th of January, 2024).

So i ended up paying for my flight 3 times! 

Each one of them, very expensive, money that i could not afford, just to be able to get home. 

Because of this issue, i returned to my holiday broke, basically having no money for food or to pay my rent, i had to go borrowing and a month now since the event happened I'm still struggling financially. They basically took away the last means of survival i had without one atom of care on how it would affect my livelihood.

 I have tried to explain my financial situation to them and how what they did will affect my life but they don't care one bit. They have refused my refund. Now my landlord is threatening to send me packing if i don't pay the rent. I wonder where i would live. I really need to get my money back as i am out of work currently and have no means of living right now.

In a word..... RUBBISH !!!!!!,Dubai,Manchester,International,"In a word‚Ä¶ rubbish !!
Uncomfortable seats, no legroom, poor food,poor soft drinks,rubbish organisation. Overall Crap experience. 
THE SEATS on the 1hr flight from MAN to CDG was comfier with more legroom on the short hall airbus‚Äôs they fly than the OLD long haul Boeing‚Äôs seats 

DXB to MAN‚Ä¶ 14hrs 

Where do I start, I paid ¬£4111 for a family a four return to Dubai ( FLIGHT COST ONLY ) and I can honestly say for a national airline Air France is rubbish. 
We did Manchester  to Dubai via CDG. 
The way over wasn‚Äôt bad but it wasn‚Äôt good‚Ä¶ like the snack we had in the Manchester flight was literally half a cheese sandwich (picture attached)lol 
It was a night flight to Dubai from CDG and the seats are not very comfortable at all and my backside was Literally killing when we landed. 
We thought we‚Äôll it wasn‚Äôt great‚Ä¶ 
But well‚Ä¶. not to bad‚Ä¶. 
But the return flight was really poor and actually made me write this review‚Ä¶ 
The first review I‚Äôve ever wrote about an airline and I fly monthly.  
We checked in on line as instructed and we had resevered and paid for 2 twin seats at the back for me the Mrs and kids‚Ä¶ 
The kids are only young and was really looking forward to there  window seats..

Unbeknown to us there had been a last minute change of plane, we checked our luggage in and was given our boarding cards‚Ä¶. 
But our seats had been changed and nothing was explained to us EVEN though we had paid extra for those seats we was placed elsewhere instead.  
So when we boarded the plane I was using the original screenshots off my app‚Ä¶
The seat layout was completely different and had changed to what we had booked and caused us loads of problems and for the kids that was immensely looking forward to pre paid window seats being stuck slap bang in the middle of the plane‚Ä¶ great start. 
Worse was yet to come. 
2hrs into the flight and diverted to KUWAIT üá∞üáº because of a medical emergency a few hours there led to us missing our connecting flight in CDG and had to be placed onto a 3hrs later flight instead‚Ä¶. 
Remember the seats I complained about‚Ä¶ my backside was really hurting this time lol. 
The food throughout was very average..
The cabin staff ( in particular a guy called Roger ) really did their best. 
But for what service we got for the amount of money we paid Air France you really are Piss Poor.!!!

AND TO TOP IT ALL !!!!! 
I have to claim a refund through there website for THERE FAULT using my time and then claim back the money for the seats reservations they didn‚Äôt give me‚Ä¶
It clearly says enter the 10 digit number AFTER the airlines 057 code‚Ä¶.. 
AND IT DOESN‚ÄôT WORK !!!!! 
And instantly asks for another number which I simply cannot find‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

"AVOID AIR FRANCE AT ALL COSTS, THANK ME LATER!",Paris,Sao Paulo,International,"[CLAIM NUMBER C-7491040]

This time my wife and I decided to use Air France because of slightly better flight times that fitted better with the sleep pattern of our 11 month infant. BIG MISTAKE. On arrival in Sao Paulo, our baby car seat was not delivered. We were planning to spend our 12 hour wait in Sao Paulo with my wife's sister, who would drive us to the coach station of Barra Funda to take a coach to our final destination. We had to cancel this plan because we couldn't drive our baby in a private car without a baby car seat. Sao Paulo's state allows taxi drivers to take infants without a car seat, which we had to do as there was no other choice to get to our coach, but we had to put our baby's safety at risk by doing this (40 minute drive) and incur in extra expenses. We were promised we would receive our baby car seat at our final destination within two days, which didn't happen. We were then offered to pick up the car seat within another two extra days by travelling ourselves to the nearest local airport (1 hour drive) or waiting at our final address up to 7-8 days, at which point we would have wasted half of our holiday time. We took the first option as we were already cancelling many of our family plans due to not being able to travel with our baby anywhere without our baby car seat. However, the car seat was not available for collection until a week later, so were misled as we not only waited a full week but we also had to drive one hour at our expense to collect our baby car seat at the local airport. We were also planning to hire a rental car and given the unreliability of the information given by Air France we had to include a baby car seat as an extra in the rental car, otherwise we would have had to cancel even further family plans in our Christmas holidays. At the airport in Sao Paulo we were told to keep receipts of our expenses resulting from the delayed baggage and they would be reimbursed, which was obviously a BIG LIE. We claimed a miserable ¬£142.65 as honest expenses resulting from the delayed baggage, which is really nothing taking into account how much stress and damage they have made to our holiday time, as we were mainly travelling to allow my wife's family meet our new baby. However, they have declined to reimburse such an insignificant amount of money, of course with a nicely worded email emphasising how much they care about customer satisfaction (what a joke!). Not only the lied to us at the airport about refunding our expenses resulting from delayed baggage, they messed us up and down to get our baby car seat late and at our own expense, made us incur in extra expenses as a result of their utter incompetence to deliver a baby car seat, and also ruined over half of our Christmas holidays that we had been planning for months so that my wife's family could meet our 11 month infant, all that for the 'modest' price of around ¬£2,500.

Worst flying experience you will ever have.,New York City,Zagreb,International,"Hello. I am filing this complaint as well as a request for refund due to miscommunications that AirFrance took a large part in.  I was denied boarding due to an Air France error of putting my FlyingBlue information rather than my legal name that I provided with passport information during my booking on my boarding passes. I was permitted flight from JFK to CDG (AF 005) with the original name on my boarding pass, however my flight from CDG to ZAG (OU 471) was refused for my connecting flight due to this error. I requested my name to be changed and sent the appropriate document details (a photo of my passport) on the flight date 12/9/2023. The passport details were not submitted I came to find out the day of my departure from a different representative. After being stranded in Paris airport for hours, I had to book an additional flight for an additional $770 USD. My original representative stated my details were submitted and it would take no longer than an hour for an update.  However, this agent (Rosy) as well as her supervisor told me my only option was to book another flight since my details were not changing.  I called for a final time the morning of my return flight because I never heard back from Rosy or AirFrance about at least the changes for my return tickets since I was told it was still in process on 12/8/2023. My last representative (Paula) submitted the appropriate documents once I sent them over for the 3rd time, and the details for corrected nearly immediately.  Paula was the representative that investigated the issue and found no submission of my passport photos or details that I had requested days prior.  If I would have received the same level of service from Rosy and her supervisor the first time, I would not have been denied boarding, and would thus not have had to purchase an additional one way ticket to my destination. I was stranded in Paris for over 6 hours with the stress of not knowing if I would be able to make it to my destination and/or back to my origin without having to spend last minute expenses. The staff was insanely rude at the desk, and at first Rosy didn‚Äôt understand why they wouldn‚Äôt let me on to begin with if I was granted boarding at the origin airport because that would be the logical thing to do. Then it simply went down hill from there. She then became rude and confrontational and the options I had quickly dwindled until I had no choice but to cave and buy a flight that doubled my trip. The desk agents at the boarding gates were arrogant and were not helpful in trying to reach someone about the matter because I was in France for the first time as an American traveler and I was starting to panic. They seemed irritated more than remorseful and didn‚Äôt want to help whatsoever. All they said was ‚Äúno good.‚Äù And asked for the next person in line.

Synopsis:
Rosy, the initial customer representative misinformed me about the procedure for my name change.  which developed into multiple flights being missed in an attempt to travel. It was stated my passport details would take 45 minutes to an hour to update. Then I was informed it would be 48 to 72 hours for the update. When I called on 12/12/23 and spoke with customer representative Paula, she was efficient enough to have my details updated with an urgency. I was informed through this agent that my passport details and photos were never submitted. If I had the same services in the beginning of my trip, I would not have experienced such disruptions. My original booking reference was SXBOPZ. The booking reference for my last minute flight was 4JN972 with Lufthansa Airlines that was booked through AirFrance. My $800 trip ended in being $1570. All phone calls were recorded and I have emails in support of lack of communication and negligence of a representative submitting the appropriate documents in order to change my details in a timely manner. This was hands down the worst flight experience I have ever encountered. Save yourselves the stress and use a different airline. They don‚Äôt like Americans.

Biased crew and terrible after care,Johannesburg,Paris,International,"We chose premium economy with the expectation of more space and a touch of luxury, although the premium price, in my opinion, was on the high side. The food was average, but the legroom was satisfactory. Unfortunately, our flight experience was soured by an issue with the passengers in front of us (without delving into details). The French couple in front involved the Air France crew, and it became apparent that bias was present from the beginning.

The initial crew member showed little interest in hearing our side, immediately involving the pursers. While the pursers were more accommodating, it was evident in our discussions that we were being viewed as the problem, and we were expected to accommodate the couple in front. The following morning, no inquiry was made about our well-being, but special attention was given to the French couple, with shared laughter between the crew and them.

Although the crew has no control over passengers, their biased handling of the situation was unacceptable. I lodged a complaint with Air France, and had to wait three month for a message that apologized for the inconvenience caused by the passengers in front. Regrettably, there was no acknowledgment of the clear discrimination we experienced for not being French, and my case was promptly closed.

I had hoped for an apology from Air France for the mistreatment by the crew before sharing my experience online, but the handling of this situation has compelled me to write this review. All in all, the trip was terrible, and Air France's handling of my complaint marked it as the worst flight and aftercare experience I've ever encountered. I have decided never to fly with Air France again.",2023-10,2024-01-24,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0

Racist staff (except for Miriam) and poor service. Never again,Paris,New Delhi,International,"We were travelling to India to consecrate my mother's ashes in Haridwar. We flew from Geneva to CDG and then on to Delhi. En route to Delhi, the air stewardess that was serving drinks and food completely ignored me. When dinner was being served she served all of the Caucasian passengers and ignored me. Despite my repeated pleas for her to come to me and provide me with food, she kept telling me that she would come back. 20 minutes of asking, when everyone was being served their dessert I was still waiting for food. It was only when I asked the woman (Miriam) who was taking excellent care of my children that food was served to me. In a form of apology, another air stewardess approached me to register my family for air miles.
When we arrived in Delhi, all of our checked in luggage had not made it to Delhi. We arrived early morning on 14/10/23 and no luggage. We hade to spend in excess of 226 CHF to buy clothes for out trip. We were literally taking another flight on 14/10/23 to Dehradun and a taxi to Haridwar. We had to to go and purchase additional clothes as were still without them. Our suitcases eventually arrived on 16/10/24 for which we had to plan and incur additional costs for taxis to the airport to pick up our luggage. Of the four large suitcases, three had suffered irreparable damage and we have now had to replace these.

My luggage did not make it.  A tracker I had in my luggage told me it was still at NBO but I could not get anyone in baggage claim or with customer service to tell me when I could expect my bag or why it was still at NBO. Not a single word from AF for 5 days even though I knew where my bag was located.   I did not receive my bag until the night of 7/11/24, over one week later. A brief email with a ""sorry for the delay"" was all I got.  I spent a huge amout of time with this matter. Air France should offer some type of compensation for a passenger's inconvienience in cases like this even if the passenger doesn't have out of  pocket expenses.  A voucher for a small amount off their next flight on Air France & a partner such as KLM & Delta is IMHO not too much to ask.  And they need to do a better job communicating with passengers as to the status of missing luggage.

Boycotting Air France!,Paris,Mumbai,International,"Dear Air France Team,

I hope this gets to the senior most person.

I write this note with a lot of disappointment and sadness.

I‚Äôm 34 years old and have been lucky enough to travel the world over.
I have never in my life faced what I recently faced with Air France and the crew.

I was to board a flight from Paris to Mumbai - nonstop on 17 January 2024, PNR NGZYIH. I booked Premium Economy.

The take-off was planned for 1:50 pm.
It was delayed and pushed to 2:45 pm.
We got onto the flight around then.

We always book a wheelchair for my mother at all airports because she has had multiple surgeries and cannot walk a lot.
There was a very kind lady at the Paris airport, ground staff Mrs Bala. I requested if I could take my mum before the crowd moves in and she very kindly helped us with this.

Around 2:50 pm, we are on board.
Several announcements about a hydraulic problem and technical issues, then an announcement about a team of mechanics not being able to fix the issue, after 5.5 hours we are taken off the plane and told we will be put on the same flight (1:50 pm) the next day. 

This is where it all begins. All the true colours of Air France ‚Äúhospitality‚Äù! 

3 hours into sitting on the plane and no food. Lunch time has passed and everyone is hungry.

I go opto the crew and request for anything to eat - biscuits or even a piece of bread. 
She gives me several tiny boxes of cheese biscuits and some dark chocolate. I tell her not to give me too much as the others will see and I would feel bad. She winks at me and says ‚Äútake it.‚Äù A few minutes later, they serve all guests a small, cold, taste carrot sandwich (mind you, freezing winter).

Coming back to deplaning us 5.5 hours later, they say they will provide accommodation.
Everyone is tired, confused, not understanding the issue, worried because some of us have doctor appointments, work appointments etc.
Lots of chaos and commotion at the airport. Crowds of people.

Once we are deplaned, we are walking out towards the airport. I ask the crew for a wheelchair because of my mother. No wheelchair, they say. I spotted some buggys/carts that people sit on and travel around the airport but no one to drive them! 
This is around 8 pm in evening, mind you! 
Not like it‚Äôs at an odd hour of the morning.

Anyway, we have to make my mother walk all the way with her stick. But to where?? Scattered crew here and there, very few on the ground, and the few that we met were rude and explained things in a big hurry. 
Imagine this: a huge bunch of us waiting to know where we are supposed to go: left or right. 
We are all freezing because we‚Äôve packed our winter wear away as we‚Äôre going back to India from France during bitter cold winter!

Finally we all get to an area where we‚Äôre supposed to talk to someone else.
Apparently 4 flights were cancelled. 
You would definitely know how many passengers there must have been!! And how many staff? Maybe 10. Out of 10, 9 were rude. 
Everyone was angry and stressed. 
We didn‚Äôt know where they were putting us up.

After an hour, I managed to get the attention of a lady who asked for all my details (visa, passport, boarding pass). She asked me to wait and that the wheelchair would arrive for my mom. We waited 2 hours more. Barely any seats, have the people were sitting on the floor, some on chairs, some on armrests of chairs.

Frustrated, I went to her again only to learn that they cannot put us up at a hotel as it was ‚Äúfully booked‚Äù, but she mentioned that if we were to book Yotel ourselves then it would cost us 500 euros. How on earth can I book a room if it‚Äôs not available? After 3 hours we are being told no rooms?!! 

Then the lady says they will give us beds at the airport and she gave us 3 T-shirts to sleep in. Total joke. 

Anyway, she asked us to wait. We waited again.
Then she says those beds are also taken.

Now understand this clearly if you can: because the wheelchair took so many hours, we lost out on a hotel room AND a bed at the airport.
She says they will provide some ‚Äúday beds‚Äù to everyone. 

I explain my whole case again and tell her that my mother cannot sleep on it if it is very low because of her leg problems. 
Until now we don‚Äôt know what this day bed looks like. 

She understands from me, almost 4 hours later, that we have schengen visas! 4 hours later she says she made a mistake and thought we didn‚Äôt have visas!!! She apologised and gave us a room at Holiday Inn Express CDG.

We finally get the wheelchair and go to the gate where the airport transport is supposed to pick us up from. We wait there for an HOUR because the driver didn‚Äôt have fuel so he had to WALK SOMEWHERE TO GO GET FUEL.

Post midnight we reach our hotel. No dinner. Just some boxes of cold salad, water and a cotton T-shirt to sleep in.

We check in. We sleep in a room with hair all over the bed. So tired to ask for a change, we let it go. This is the relation Air France has with hotels.

Next morning, we were assured pick up at 9:30 am. We were given breakfast, and we were down and ready at 8:30. Had our breakfast and at the lobby at 9:20 am sharp. We waited until 10 am. Then, on asking 4 times, we were told the transport will arrive at 11:50 am.
We decided to pay for our own Uber and go. 

We went to the airport, went to our gate. Gate change and an hour late, of course.
We get onto the flight.
The crew greets us, unapologetically of course, as if all is okay.

Some people who had to sleep at the airports with their old parents and children, WITHOUT BLANKETS OR A HEATER, showed us images of those ‚Äúday beds‚Äù. 
You HAVE TO see the images I attach to this. This is where you expect my mother to sleep??? The lady who has had knee, shoulder and hip surgeries? 
DISGUSTING.

Try sleeping on these beds with small children and old parents without a blanket to cover yourself and no heater. 

Anyway, on the flight the next day:
Everyone from Premium Economy AND Economy was using the washrooms in front of us. We were in row 10. We used the washroom maybe twice.

A cabin crew tells us, when we need to go again, that we cannot go into that washroom as the flush is broken.
I found that a bit odd. 
Anyway, I asked if there was one up front at Business because it was tough for my mother to walk all the way back to the Economy washroom. 
She says there was no washroom in front of Business. 
A girl sitting by my side says she lied because she went all the way to the Business washroom herself.

My mother walked all the way behind to use the washroom. I saw someone go into the one in front of us and I asked if it was fixed now. Then I was told that it was only for Business. I mean what the hell is this mess? 

The crew was so RUDE. Bitter and sour!

My mother asked for a sealed bottle of water and the crew says it‚Äôs all over! I said there are so many seats free, please hand over one from there and the man says it‚Äôs all over. I got up and picked up FOUR bottles from free seats and showed it to him.
My mother also has kidney stones.

I MUST ASK:
What kind of people are you?
What skin are you made of?
Who is this crew of yours? 
What kind of families do they come from?
Do they have mothers and children?

I understand that a washroom maybe only for Business and that no one else maybe allowed to use it. BUT, if people from Economy are going to the Business washroom, AND people from Premium, who the HELL are you to stop my mother who has a problem with her health? 

Do the Business class passengers have skin or backsides made of gold?

Seriously, who are you to not even provide a bottle of water? I am enraged now as I recall every step.

The crew confirmed to my father that there was no mushroom in the meal. He is allergic. There was mushroom. On our way to Paris, he was given EGGS when he said he doesn‚Äôt eat eggs.

Is your crew only rude and useless or also uneducated?
If someone who is allergic lands up in a hospital, you will be sued. You know that right?

Are you only paying crew high salaries to wear tight uniforms and smile with tonnes of makeup on or also serve with good treatment and compassion? Please be human!

This was the most disgusting experience I‚Äôve had of my life.

If you decide to do something about it, I will tell you more instances I‚Äôve had but I am so DONE travelling this crappy airline.

Please remember that I understand these things happen but you are not a POOR airline. You have to make better adjustments and be ready for situations and if you cannot then the least you can do is BE NICE. And if you are a poor airline, kindly shut down.

Shameful !!,Beirut,Montreal,International,"Hello,

Since no one answered or cared for weeks!!!, I will have to share this through social media and all other channels , maybe I'll have some fair and Deserved attention.

Here's the details.

Reference number: UCN2VB
Name: Sahak Dermesrobian 
Flying blue number: 5143 478 873

‚Ä¢My return flight from Beirut to Paris was canceled , then they rescheduled us to another flight to Paris.

‚Ä¢ they said that we have enough time to take our connection flight from Paris to Montreal Canada ( didn't tell the truth, which is very bad legally and ethically).¬†we told them we don't have time to take our connection flight (after they rescheduled since the original got canceled), they answered  i qoute here "" our system is update , Don't worry you have two hours in Paris to take your connection flight ""

‚Ä¢We arrived to Paris and our connection flight to Montreal was already gone in the air !!! ( even though in Lebanon they confirmed that we have two hours, telling lies in this senstive situation is dangerous and illegal behavior) 

‚Ä¢ we suffered a lot in Paris and slept there one night ( we were three, all reservations were made by me with my Air France account) 

‚Ä¢ To make things even worse, i forgot my backpack inside the airplane  in the fligh from Lebanon to Paris ( flight 565) I contact the luggage service + lost and found department + Airfrance custimer service. Even though it was in the airplane the crew couldn't find it !!!! Which is weird.

So after the cancelation + after missing the connection flight due to the Airline mistake and layin directly on us + losing a lot of time in Paris + suffering a lot since we had with us an elderly man with health conditions  (Mr.Elias Hanna, reference L54I2P ) + not finding my backpack, I  am not qualified to a compensation Or/and even a refund for all these many troubles ?

Even in my Air France Application they notified me that we are qualified to compensation¬†!

I have high hope that airfrance will do something for this manner since it is not fair at all plus it affects the reputation of airfrance very negatively....

Never again,Detroit,Athens,International,"Wow where to start.  First, not sure why they allow you to book a flight you can barely make a connection. Ours was a flight from Detroit USA to Athens Greece with a 1 ¬Ω hour layover in CDG Paris France.  You realize this is barely possible when you land, and you see your next gate is three train stops away and you must exit and reenter customs and security lines to get back into the gate areas and then run though crowds and shops all the way to the end for the next gate. Forget trying to grab food or water or even using the restroom. Second, our flight into Greece the pilot missed the runway or something and had to pull up last minute and just says we must fly around again for 10 minutes to try that again. Super scary but OK we landed.  Then, on the way home from Paris back to Detroit, we are what seems to be a reasonable 2 1/2 hours early we asked and waited in area 5 for Air France for quite some time but was told by security we do not need this line and to head to security line past the pharmacy. After waiting a long time in that line, we were turned away and made to go back to check bags as they count both the backpack and carry on for the weight of 12 kilos maximum apparently. Our bags were not checked on the way in by the way and we see many bags that are way larger once we board the plane so are confused on who they check and why. So, then we go back to the check bag area, and they tell us it is now closed and that we should throw our bags away or rebook! What a joke, we came with these bags and were not asked any questions on the way to Greece. Then after asking for a manager, they say OK proceed to the business class areas and we can get your bags on. Another 30 minutes later we are forced to pay over 200euros even though I've already prepaid for bags and their credit card machine does not work so we need to run to the other check bag area 5 again and wait there as everyone is busy and will not help us.  The agent insists I still have time and makes us wait until they can find a credit card machine to pay the fee, we've already prepaid for they give us a tiny receipt with no information on it. Finally, we can make our way to the security line again after 2 hours we only now have 1/2 hour to make it to our gate. We are then waiting in long lines to scan our passport/boarding pass and then going through the x-rays my son is the only one forced to take off his shoes and we need to wait for a swab scan as I'm in line I get a text that our gate is now closing! We must take a train still and run through all the duty-free shops again my son now without his shoes on. By the grace of God, we made it to the gate, and they say OK we can get on but then they scan my son's passport and say, ""did you pay for his bag""!!! They ask where my receipt is and when I show it to them, they say, ‚Äúthis is all they gave you?‚Äù and wanted to charge us a third time for him to bring on a backpack???!!! I just don‚Äôt get it. This was by far the most disorganized and crazy airport crew and security I have ever experienced. I am just grateful to be home and safe with bags in hand.

Had to rush through the airport and security and were one of the last on the plane. Cherry on top, my baggage didn't arrive at my destination on both ways!

Wanna feel like a sardine ?,Paris,Raleigh,International,"Absolutely horrible. I have never been in such an uncomfortable seat even when flying with low-cost companies.

When the front seat was reclined, it was only 2 inches from my face ( and I am 6 feet tall and 156 lbs, so I am pretty slim ). 
Also, the internet connection I paid for did not work during the entire flight. The flight crew said that was the norm, not an exception. I got my money back three weeks after filing a petition.",2023-10,2024-01-08,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0
Air France don't pay their due!!!,Stockholm,Poitiers,Europe,"They lost my hiking gear for eight days and in total I had to spend over 1500‚Ç¨ because of this.

I also had to 5 nights in hotels because of this which i didn't want or planned for which I had to pay for my self!! For several day they told me the bag will come this afternoon or tomorrow...

We were treated rudely - told to get a cab at midnight (airport was closed) - and had to find our own accommodations in order to show up the next day and be bounced back and forth from airline to airline due to their mistake in our ticket processing.  
We finally made it home two days later, requested compensation for our stay and cab and they denied.

Rude customer service,Paris,Los Angeles,International,"The staff at the Air France airline checkin port at Charles De Gaulle Airport are extremely rude and caused me to miss my flight. I was traveling with my family of 9 and AirFrance caused an immense amount of stress and anxiety our entire trip home. As we made our way to TSA, we were stopped to weigh our carry-on items. The staff informed us that both our carry on and our bag had to equal 12kg in total. The first time we went through we were told our items were over the limit so we stepped out of line and moved things around in order to meet the requirement. The second time we went through we were faced with one of the most non-compliant, arrogant, and rude staff member that I have ever encountered in an airport setting. After weighing our bags for a second time, one of our bags was over 12kg by 1kg. The staff member told us the we need to check in the bag. After insisting many times that we would take out some of our items which would cause our bags to meet the requirement since our flight was close to boarding, The staff member rudely refused and said that we must go check our bags in causing us to miss our flight. On top of that, our flight had a connecting stop in Seattle which we also didn‚Äôt make AND we already had 5 checked bags that left on the flight without us. This is outrageous and I am extremely upset by this situation. It is already hard as it is traveling with a big group like ours but when staff members also add complications to our travels, it gets out of control and ruins the whole experience. This is my second time traveling with AirFrance and both times I have been treated with disrespect and I would not recommend this airline to anyone.",2024-01,2024-01-08,1.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,3.0

Changed the flight less than 2 days prior and aweful customer service,Paris,Montreal,International,"My experience with airfrance was a disaster and their customer service clearly didn‚Äôt care to help. 
My flight was moved 5 hours earlier than it should have been with less than two days notice. Not only was this a major inconvenience but, as I was coming from far, it meant buying a whole new train ticket to the airport. 
When I called customer service they had us on call for 20 min to tell us they wouldn‚Äôt do anything for me, not even change my new seat to a window seat as it was originally- the bare minimum you would think. The only way to have the window seat that I booked 6 whole months in advance would‚Äôve been to pay a supplement despite the airline being the problem - they couldn‚Äôt even do that. So not only did they not care to help but they wasted my time refusing to give me a good reason for it. 
I barely just turned eighteen and this was my first time flying back to university, away from my family, and because of airfrance‚Äôs horrible planning, my already short break was cut even shorter and my travel anxiety made much worse.

"Poor service, hiding food made to be like Oliver twist.",Birmingham,Los Angeles,International,"My experience of the air to and from holiday this year using Air France has been the most horrible flight I have taken. First and the most frustrating is that on the four flights we had to get to our destination each one was delayed, which meant we were running about on every transfer there after to another delayed Air France flight. Second the flight was good and a normal plane, but as for food there seems to be a reason for the cabinet crew to hide the food that should be available on a 14 hour flight at the back of the plane away from every one, so your sitting there wondering what is happening and starving, the  you find out there is a buffet that your made to feel like Oliver twist begging for food of which your only allowed one small sandwich and a small yogurt drink. We learnt from this and had to pay more for a sandwich on the return and was also made to feel small eating a when the cabin crew walked past us. 
Third on the return leg after being delayed again, we were placed in a emergency exit location which had no location for our bags, the crew member who sat in front of us had a cold and cough, so in addition to the insult of lack of food and made small we are both ill with a cold",2023-12,2023-12-29,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

My disappointment with them involved several hours of delays, overhead compartment overfill issues, communication system issues that needed repair [we sat in the plane the 2 hours while it was fixed], flight cancellation and rebooking, and luggage damage.

The good:
*Staff was friendly
*Food was good and nutritious
*Clean airplane
* Leg space was OK

What needs improvement:
*Translate French to English on all communications.
*Please advise your luggage crew to not throw the bags.
* Empower your staff to act when things have gone wrong.  Several passengers asked for snacks on the flight when we were delayed. The staff kept apologizing but never took action.

Avoid!!,Copenhagen,Houston,International,"Had the dubious pleasure of a stop in Paris Charles De Gaulle that lasted 24 hours instead of 1 hour. 
Arriving at CDG with Air France from CPH about 10 minutes late on the tarmac, and had to get to my connecting flight in another terminal. There were only 2 people at the passport control actually checking passports and around 10 people with the main job of ignoring people whose flights were about to leave without them and telling us dont worry your flight will wait for you. Well, they didnt. Myself and maybe 30-40 other passengers were stranded in CDG. 
I stood in line for about two hours before an agent helped me get a booking for the next day, but unfortunately no compensation could be given as it was not Air France's fault.
Well, if you sell trips with a 1 hour layover in an airport so disastrously managed, then I do hold you responsible.

My Air France Lives up to Expectation,Dallas,Paris,International,"On December 15, 2023, I flew to Paris on Air France to connect to Lagos, Nigeria, my final destination. Boarding was called, and we converged at the gate in terminal D. The signs they had identifying groups for boarding made the environment very orderly and the boarding process seamless. Once the passengers started boarding, the Flight Attendants did an excellent job in getting all passengers seated and luggage properly stowed in the overhead compartments. They made sure the aisle was not helded-up so passengers found their seats and were ready for departure. The flight actually taxied off three minutes earlier than the scheduled time. This was supper efficient.

During the flight, the attendants were very professional, courteous, and helpful. They were also very proactive in anticipating what passenger's issues were and were there right on time to resolve them. The Purser was really great, always wearing a smile and paying attention to frequent flyers, making them comfortable and feel valued. 

The food was great. Of the two choices they had for the economy class, they did not run out of any. I had my choice of chicken, and their usual red and white wine selection was great and available throughout the flight.

The flight was smooth throughout, and the attendants were checking on passengers regularly. The flight arrived in Paris 15 minutes earlier, which was great for those of us connecting flights.

I called back and asked for that manager and not only did the new woman refuse to let me speak to the person who I could name, she then stopped responding on the call but would not hang up - my guess is because they have customer service tracking of some sort where they get in trouble if they hang up.

Once we finally boarded, we sat on the tarmac for 1 hr without explanation. When I asked a flight attendant why we were delayed for so long, she asked ‚Äòhave you seen all the luggage?‚Äô, and claimed that the delay was caused by excess luggage.

I received a cold meal. When I asked the flight attendant if I could get a hot meal, she raised her voice at me. When I went to the galley to dispose of my cold food, the same flight attendant aggressively shoved another container of cold food at me. After I complained about this behaviour, her supervisor then ‚Äòreheated‚Äô a new  meal, which was tasteless and cold despite being ‚Äòreheated‚Äô for me.

Due to my not eating the cold tasteless meal, hours later I was starving, so I went to the galley to ask for snacks. Two flight attendants who I encountered, said they didn‚Äôt have snacks, and looked at me like I was asking for illegal drugs.

Angry passengers who stopped paying attention to the turbulence light because it was nearly ALWAYS on (when we hadn't had turbulence for 30 minutes - this happened regularly). My wife's gluten free meal was served frozen. When I complained they offered some crisps and nothing else - despite me asking if they could see if there were any other options for food. Then as I was leaving, as the seat was locked in a different position, I couldn't really do my post flight checks, so I ended up leaving my earbuds in the pocket. 

Complained afterwards, it was a torturous process. Customer Services never answered my complaint. Everything was always generic and they then closed down the complaint right aftwards. I had to keep opening up new complaints just so I could get someone to respond. They consistenly ignored every attempt to go in depth regarding my complaint.

Shocking treatment.,Paris,Los Angeles,International,"I will never fly Air France for the rest of my life. I‚Äôve travelled a lot and flown with a lot of bad airlines, but these guys take the biscuit. 

I had booked a window seat when I checked in two days ago. Only when I get to the gate, 20 minutes before my flight, do I hear they have changed my seat without asking me. They put me in a middle seat of 4 seat. When I insisted I needed a window seat, they held up the entire boarding process for 10/15 minutes, only to come back and say they have nothing for me. But, they told me they had put me in a seat with extra leg room. That was a lie. It was a seat with a wall in front of me. Also, the flight attendants were rude when I tried to look for another seat. 

The flight itself was awful. Too hot. Terrible food. Incredibly uncomfortable seat. I will genuinely avoid Air France for the rest of my life.",2023-12,2023-12-16,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0
"Seat changes, dirty cabin, rude customer service at CDG, avoid!",Paris,Bangkok,International,"My pre-paid seat selection (extra fee of ¬£77 even for business class) was changed by Air France 3 times in the 24 hours before the flight. The last change was 20 minutes before boarding, from a window to a middle seat and not next to my wife as planned. No reason was given and I was very rudely informed that the flight was full and this was the only available seat. The service desk staff at CDG are horrible.

The seat was dirty, I had to clean food, crumbs, beverage marks, and smudges off the screen, table, and overall cabin area. The seat had crumbs on it from the previous flight. The pillow was dirty, clearly not changed out from the last flight. This is in long haul business class!

The central divider for the middle seats did not work, the small screen controller did not work, the ‚Äúmouse pointer‚Äù just hovered in the top corner of the screen making it useless. My wife received no water bottle like all other passengers in business class and was told there were no more on the plane. 

My wife's headphones would cut out at the slightest touch to the cord side of the headphones. The seat next to her didn't recline, so the passenger and crew tried to reset it at least 10 times during the 11 hour flight, making a very noticeable disturbance in a cabin of people trying to sleep.

They seatbelt sign went on mid flight with very minor turbulence and a flight attendant woke me up with a flashlight directly in my eyes to ask if my seatbelt was on, which is was. I have never had a flashlight pointed directly in my eyes in any circumstance, much less on a business class flight. 

To add to all of this, the flight was delayed nearly 3 hours and we sat ON THE PLANE during the delay. They loaded the entire 777 and it sat there for 3 hours while they ‚Äúfixed the brakes‚Äù. Out 11.5 hour flight turned into 14.5 hours on the plane.

Abhorrent treatment of passengers - Avoid at all costs,Rome,Paris,Europe,"My return trip definitely confirmed that Air France is a budget airline with zero-rated service and respect for customer whatsoever. My initial flight timing was changed for an operational reason - fine. But now my return trip seat also changed with barely a few days notice - even as i held a fully paid seat choice. To finish off the horrible service, no cabin baggage was allowed and they found issue with my small cabin luggage and insisted for it to be checked in, even as my other backpack was bigger. A full flight was cited for this, but I found it hilarious when my first flight was fully booked and it was ok to bring up cabin baggage. 

What they will do here is insist on the fine print that Cabin baggage is not guaranteed, and proceed to say it was operational reason that I lost my PAID FOR seat choice with no entitlement whatsoever. A carrier full of deceit and giving up our seats to other passenger sounds like a low-class organisation deserving of no prestige it so proudly announces.

The most stressful trips are with Airfrance,Gdansk,Lima,International,"Never again with Airfrance!

I bought a combined flight from Gdansk to Lima. Sure tickets were not cheap and I payed full ticket price.
But when I was checking in for the flight 20 hours in advance, I was granted a standby seats for all 3 flights! Moreover, my friend checked in later, and she were not given a standby seats.

When I reached the support in whatsup, they asked me to come to the airport earlier and address my issue to Airfrance agent. I went to the airport at 2.30 a.m. (my flight was scheduled at 6:15). And what? There were nobody to help me. And there were no Airfrance agent, of course! The advice in whatsup form Airfrance was to wait until boarding starts and go to check in desk. But at check in desk they could not give me the boarding pass and sent to the gate. At the gate they asked to wait. And only after boarding started, I received boarding passes.
I‚Äôve been in a constant  stress for more than 24 hours. No assistance and no support. 

On my way back I had 3 flights provided by airfrance and the final flight provided by another company. I had much time for interchanges bettween flights. 
But as a result, every airfrance flight has been delayed. 
My final flight was at 23:05, and I arrived with airfrance at 22:58. A good time slot to change the planes! 

The only thing I am grateful for is cabin crew! I asked them to provide me with possibility to run first from the plane. Thank you for this opportunity!
So again only nerves and stress.

One more thing:  in Paris before the checkin they decided to make all the passangers to move to another part of the airport, as the gate changed unexpectedly.

More over after some delay air france application showed me a message that I am entitled to compensation, but when I clicked the message for several times, error occurred: Sorry, something went wrong. And after severa tries even the whole message about compensation dissapeared.

Manipulation of prices,Boston,Cairo,International,"Air France is probably the worst airline I traveled with. I had originally booked a round-trip flight from Boston to Cairo, with a departure flight of 18 hours. However, they significantly changed my itinerary, extending the flight duration to 28 hours.

What is particularly troubling is that tickets for my original itinerary are now being sold at $2464, a significant increase from the approximately $500 I initially paid. They claimed that the flight had been canceled, necessitating the change. However, when I pointed out that the original flight was still available on their website, they asserted that it was not bookable, and was not listed as an available option. Subsequently, they booked me on a 26-hour-long flight as an alternative.

I also needed to change my flight back and although they have ones for the original price of $800 and I paid already $600 so technically I should pay the $200 difference, they refused to say that I can't downgrade my class but I am on the economy so they said there are classes within the same class and I need to pay $1200 to change my ticket which is more than my entire round-trip original price.",2023-12,2023-12-10,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

Horrible Experience,New York City,Florence,International,"Will never fly Air France again and will not choose a layover at Charles De Gaulle again either.  We traveled JFK to Florence Italy with a stop in Paris using Delta operating as Air France. Our flight from JFK arrived on time. Going through border control was a nightmare. Not enough agents and the auto checkers were not working. There were hundreds of passengers queued up and just not moving. The border agents were more interested in chatting with each out than moving passengers along. They assumed nobody spoke French and were trash talking about the passengers, when called on it, they just shrugged. Everyone on our plane missed their connecting flight. Customer service was less than helpful.  They told the 2 Asian people in front of us there were no flights out for two days. We were a party of 5 and they put us on an afternoon flight same day but we had to spend 12 hours at the airport. The Asian people were going to the same destination as we were. We missed an entire day of our trip because of the incompetence of both Air France and the border control agents.

Returning, Air France required us to check in at the desk to get boarding passes. I always travel carryon and am a stickler for checking size and weight. The woman at the desk insisted that my bag was too big and she would have to weigh both my carryon and personal item. I put it in the sizing bin and it fit easily. She insisted it was too big and would not give me my boarding pass unless I checked the bag. Both bags weighed in under the limit but she refused to give me back my carryon.  She was the same woman at the gate. She let the man in front of me go through with a much larger carryon than I had. I objected and she did one of those shrugs and made me go through.

RUDE AND DISRESPECTFUL ATTENDANTS,Paris,Marseille,Domestic,"First of all my flight was delayed and the flight attendants made no effort to keep the lines organized. They would open up random lines and then people would push their way up the line and skip everyone crowded in the back of the line. 

They called group 3, end I finally got to the gate entrance. The attendant told me that I needed to check my carryon because ‚Äúit was a full flight‚Äù. Keep in mind there are 6 groups and I was group 3.  I told her that I didn‚Äôt want to because I had a lot of valuables and important things in my carry on. She said rudely that I had no choice. Now, if I was in group 5 or 6, I would‚Äôve completely understanded the fact that it was a ‚Äúfull flight‚Äù. I noticed that people behind me were let in without getting their carryons tagged. When I boarded the plane, i saw that half the overhead compartments were empty. Everything after row 17 ish was empty. In addition, the front half of the overhead compartments were filled with jackets and smaller backpacks and purses. Despite the announcement made while boarding that smaller items must be put under the seat in front of you, passengers didn‚Äôt seem to acknowledge this at all nor did the the flight attendants enforce this at all. So I went in since the flight attendants in front greeting everyone didn‚Äôt seem to care. The lady from the front came up, grabbed my bag, and told me that I need to put my carryon outside. I objected, but she didn‚Äôt seem to care and ignored me. I noticed that more and more people in the groups after me had carryons. Almost everyone had carryons the same size as mine (some even bigger) and the flight attendants were even making room for their bags in the overhead. I noticed that even the last few people that boarded the plane had brought their carryons onto the plane. Why was I told that the flight was full even though half of it was empty when I boarded? How come after I let her know that I had valuables in my carryon she forced me to check my carryon even still? And why do earlier groups have to make room for later groups carryons?? I am so annoyed with this experience and the lack of respect the attendance had.

Later on in the flight, that same flight attendant skipped over our row when serving drinks. I was not sleeping, my eyes were open, and I had been waiting since she started serving the row before me for my drink. But she just walked right past as if I didn‚Äôt exist and asked the ladies in the row after me what they wanted. 

 I am a highly frequent flyer; I fly once a week on average and I‚Äôve flown with every single major international airline. Never have I received such bad service and care on a flight, even on spirit and Southwest Airlines.

Great flight if our bags had not been left in Atlanta,Atlanta,Paris,International,Mixed review for Air France.  First of all they were one hour late out of Atlanta which made us worry about our connection in Paris.  Actually we made it to Paris only 20 minutes late.  They had rebooked us on an earlier flight out of Atlanta but sent a text message that i did not get until close to boarding time.  Once we went to the new gate we found out they had given out seats away.  ultimately they had taken our bags off the original flight and we did not get them for 3 days.  For the flight from Atlanta to Paris the service was wonderful.  Best I have seen in some time flying with Delta and American.  Great service crew.

Appalling airline and absolutely no customer service whatsoever.,Paris,Nairobi,International,"Dreadful airline. Customer service don‚Äôt give a toss. 
 
I paid extra for both the outgoing and incoming flights for better seats.
 
The flights were changed at the last minute. I spoke with Air France who assured me that the seats would remain the same.
 
On none of the flights between Paris and Nairobi did we get our seats. We paid ¬£210.00 for this.
 
On arrival at Nairobi our rucksacks had not arrived. We were told they were on the next flight, a day later. This meant we had to delay the climb by a day. We had to book another night at the airport hotel which cost 207.25 USD plus a meal for 47.41 USD.
We also missed a night at the safari lodge which cost 520 USD.
 
When the rucksacks arrived at Nairobi airport, we were not informed. Thankfully I had an air tag and was able to locate them. More money on taxis and a very stressful time to just get our rucksacks.
 
On my return I informed Air France of the above and received a reply saying we were not entitled to any money back. Why? Air France have cost us money through delayed luggage.

Absolutely horrendous experience with Air France - A warning to travellers considering using this airline.,Vancouver,Rome,International,"Absolutely horrendous experience with Air France - A warning to travellers considering using this airline.

A brief summary is at the bottom.

Nov 2023 Flight from Vancouver (CAN) to Rome with stopover via Charles De Gaulle Airport in Paris - We landed at the opposite end of the airport and had to dismount onto the tarmac in pouring rain ‚Äì No overhead coverings to keep the passengers out of the wet and cold; many passengers were rightly not expecting this and not dressed accordingly. We were crammed onto a shuttle bus and transported to the security checkpoint. Plane disembarkation to security checkpoint took about 25-30 minutes. Our next flight was with Air France and the scheduled layover was 1hr 40mins. Massive lineup at the security checkpoint and were shunted to a severely understaffed overflow line. This overflow line had approx. 3 planes worth of passengers and they were being screened by 1 staff member using an old system ‚Äì baggage and security trays were ferried by hand, no automation whatsoever. There was a free line next to us but that was exclusively for the 20 or so flight staff, all other passengers were ignored. 

It took 1hr and 10mins to get through the security checkpoint ‚Äì There were arguments with passengers and staff, there were arguments with passengers and passengers as people were beginning to panic that they were about to miss their connecting flights. People were begging each other to be let through first, but all were in the same situation. Other lines to our right were moving quickly again but people were expressly forbidden by staff from transferring lines, nor did they offer to redirect. Passengers started becoming visibly angry and irate as other flights had been queued and screened before them.

Once we were through, we went straight to our flight gate as they were beginning to final call our names over the PA system. Keep in mind we were as efficient as the airport allowed us to be, no bathroom breaks, no shopping, and walking as quickly as possible. Doors closed a few minutes after boarding and there were still at least 70 people in the line at the security checkpoint many of whom had now missed their flights through no fault of their own.

At our departing flight from Venice to Vancouver (via CDG and Seattle) I had found that my PR Card was either lost or stolen and denied boarding the flight; saying that the USA would not let us through. Even though I had my valid PR number, Passport and ID they would not let me board without the plastic card. The staff were not helpful or sympathetic at all and were offering bad immigration advice ‚Äì they were insistent that we quickly purchase a tourist travel visa to Canada online ‚Äì as much as we told them that was for non-residents only and even showed them policy on the Canadian Immigration website, they were insistent that was the only way they would now let us through as apparently they were now deputised as US immigration officials. We informed them that we as Permanent Residents were allowed to privately cross the US-CAN border in our own vehicle and we asked them to cancel to Seattle-Vancouver leg of the journey and let us finish the flight in Seattle. With a smirk they told us to go to the ticket desk 30 meters away and try there. Once we got to the indicated ticket desk, they were confused what we were doing there and told us to go back to the Air France staff who had clearly fobbed us off, and again told us they can‚Äôt cancel the last leg of the trip. I had to let my partner fly out by themselves while I was stuck behind having to buy another ticket with a far more co-operative and helpful airline.

Once I got to Seattle airport via another airline ‚Äì I was let straight through, no issue whatsoever. Air France fabricated and exaggerated the issue and cost us $1000 CAD out of pocket and another day of travel.

Brief Summary:
Flight disembarked onto the Charles De Gaulle (CDG) airport tarmac in cold and rain ‚Äì cramped shuttlebus to terminal.
Insanely inefficient Air France airport hub at CDG airport ‚Äì 1hr 10mins wait in security line, passengers were shouting/arguing with each other and begging to be let through first as many missed their connecting flights.
Denied boarding return flight due to missing/stolen PR Card by unsympathetic Air France staff. They insisted the US wouldn‚Äôt let us through and denied redirecting/cancelling last leg of flight - We were also given false Canadian immigration advice. We missed the flight and had to book with another airline - US Immigration let us through with no issues. Air France exaggerated the issue costing $1000CAD out of pocket.

Lackluster Business Class,Singapore,Paris,International,"Did a paid upgrade from coach to business and was fortunate to experience first hand the different cabin layouts in BOEING 787-9 (older) vs Airbus A350-900 (newer).
While both offered flat bed series, benefits stops there for the following reasons:

1) seats were not properly cleaned with left over food crumbs all over the seat and armrest area

2) cramped footwell area

3) no mattress topper

4) lavatories were surprisingly of the same standard as economy without any differentiation compared to other airlines. Only amenities available were 2 types of Clarins facial toner.

5) amenity kit contained 2 clarins product albeit the size of the last finger. Slippers were provided only on 1 occasion oddly.

6) Meals were a hit and miss. Quality of breakfast seems to pale (omelette tasted like rubber chicken meat!) in contrast to main meals such as lunch / dinner. For paid upgrades, do not there is no option to select preferred meal as AF's policy requires meal selection to be completed 48 hours prior to flight - and rule applies to all flight segments tagged to same booking reference.

7) Any excess Business class seats appeared to offered to friends / family of in-flight crew often. A pattern observed across all 3 flight segments where i flew.

8) encountered a rude crew member who reprimanded me for not 'returning to seat from the lavatory quick enough when the seat belt sign came on'. Expect more tact in Business Class service standards.

9) Outdated in flight entertainment making 14hr flights a challenge 

10) Due to the staggered layout on the Airbus 350, not all window seats have a clear view. Note when selecting seats.

"Unedible food, unfriendly service",Los Angeles,Paris,International,"We hate to write this review as my wife is French and we have had many good trips on AF in the past. Unfortunately the quality has declined dramatically in the last ten years. Our family flew AF at the end of Summer 2023. It was AF to Paris and Delta back to LA. The party consisted of two adults a teenager and three children. The flight was punctual but the food was terrible. Like something a communist Eastern European government rest home would serve in 1976. Unnameable food which none of us ate. We literally went hungry for 12 hours rather than eat the disgusting meals. Additionally the bathrooms were spaced very far apart and AF will not allow the use of inflatable footrests.  Delta on the other hand had good food, much better service and allowed the inflatable footrests so the children could sleep. The return flight was Delta comfort + and was worth every cent.

The ""Business Class"" on this EJET190 was actually one single row. As usual with AF on narrow body aircraft with a 2-2 config, the neighbor seat is NOT blocked. The crew was lovely as always, and are the remaining true gems of AF. The food wasn't disappointing to me, because I was prepared, anticipating the ever declining on-board meal quality. Not edible this time. 4 cold shrimps on cold mashed potatoes and a few pieces of cold mushrooms. The bun was rubbery, like half raw dough not crisped up properly. As a desert something that looked like chocolate or ginger bread, but tastes nothing. Meh! Honestly, AirFrance?

WORST AIRLINE AND AIRPORT- AIR FRANCE,Panama City,Bengaluru,International,"The service in first flight AF 475 was good, I had their shrimps for dinner and next day at Paris airport, I had bad loose motion the toilets were all so dirty and shabily maintained and the business lounge does not allow you there bcos my connection is next day. Every other airport I have experienced, they atleast let you stay anywhere in the airport gates or food court. Here I see no food court area, u go thru number of checking scanning of luggage, make u open suitcase even for travel pack small liquids toiletries. They tell me to come at 5.30 am to lounge. 
I luckily found one place with carpet, where I lay my shawl and slept on floor and cud sleep a bit on the floor. The airport hotel, some yono or something, when asked said 700plus usd per night.
I came thru first flight with assistance wheelchair, for second flight I did get any assistance. Which means people truly who can't walk, in a connection like mine wud be screwed.
So 6am , I go to lounge, now he says I don't have lounge access inspite of flying business. 10,000aud for business tickets is not good enough for them to provide 2 hours of lounge to just freshen up. I think it's ridiculous and such airlines and airports have made travel for people a whole miserable experience. Instead of pleasure trip. 
Hope to see such companies learn their lessons again sometime. 
Do not use air France,  is my recommendation. Having flashy shops is not good enough.
Even Indian domestic airports are better service, friendly staff and cleaner bathrooms. PARIS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT TOILETTE WERE MOST DIRTIEST I HAVE SEEN IN MY TRAVELS TO MANY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD.

They served real champagne in economy class. Headseats were available for all passengers in the seat pocket (for comparison, on the return flight KLM only provided headsets upon request and they were not enough for all passengers). The only thing I didn‚Äôt like is that cabin crew closed my window blinds when the sun started to rise above Iran, and I had to keep them closed for a few hours although I didn‚Äôt sleep.

However, 10 days before the flight the aircraft was changed again to an older A350-900 without the suite seats in business class.

On this aircraft the even rows have the window seats near the window and the armrest by the aisle and the middle 2 seats are next to each other with the armrests on the aisle whereas the odd rows have the armrest by the window and the seat on the aisle and the middle seats have the armrests next to each other and the seats on the aisle.

Non EU flyers get NO compensation,Paris,Nairobi,International,"I always thought that an airline would treat all customers equally. Wrong!  If you live outside of the EU, Air France will NOT compensate you for a severly delayed or cancelled flight.

On September 22, just a few hours before boarding an Air France flight from Vancouver to Paris, I was informed by email that Air France had cancelled my second flight from Paris to Nairobi where I was supposed to begin a safari. My only option was to take a Kenya Air flight from Paris to Nairobi, 12 hours after I landed at Charles de Gaulle airport. 

Usually when you are forced to wait 12 hours because your airline cancels your flight, you are offered a minimum of 600 Euro compensation (this is even written on the Air France info site). But Air France refuses to compensate me, using the loophole of an obscure 2004 regulation that states that if the flight does not originate or end within the EU, they're off the hook. 

Really? First of all, my cancelled flight 814 originated in Paris, which, last time I looked, is smack-dab in the middle of the EU. Secondly, since when does an international airline that flies all over the world, compensate only those who fly witin the EU? 

The fact is: Air France has an obligation to treat all customers equally, and not give preferential treatment to customers who fly only within the EU. When I flew from Dublin to Vancouver last year, and the flight was delayed by 10 hours, Air Canada paid me compensation. 

Air France might consider this: why would any Canadian citizen, or anyone living outside the EU, choose to fly with Air France if they knew that they'd be treated like second class citizens, excluded from compensation packages that other passengers receive?

My suggestion: pick another airline!",2023-09,2023-11-22,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

Do you enjoy pain?,Houston,Paris,International,"If you do than Air France is the airline for you!!

I booked flights from Houston to Athens with a stop at CDG in Paris.  ""Shockingly"" the flight from Houston to Paris was delayed an hour and to my ""endless joy"" caused me to miss my connection in Charles de Gaul ""airport"".  Air France ""Definitely"" re-booked my connecting flight.  They ""Wisely"" chose to change my flight to the ""Reliable"" Sky Air.  ""Thankfully"" Air France decided to leave me ""blissfully"" unaware of this exciting development. 
 
Upon landing at CDG I  was told by a ""knowledgeable"" employee that my original flight was also delayed and that I could make it.  On the way to the gate I had the ""enjoyment"" of passing through one of CDG many ""security"" check points.  This security point was ""efficiently"" staffed by one employee even though the line was at least 150 ft long (40 meters).  After the ""expedious"" 45 minute security line I ""Ecstaticlly"" arrived at the gate to find the plane had already departed.  I found an Air France desk nearby and was THEN informed that my flight had been re-booked on a different ""quality"" airline, Sky Air.  The attendant was unable to print a boarding pass so I was given an absolutely ""real"" recipt of the new flight lacking both gate and flight number.  I was then told I would need to proceed to terminal 2B and that I had ""plenty"" of time.   

My quest to arrive at the terminal known as 2B was ""Mythical"". Beginning, of course, at the exact same ""amazing"" security line that I had just passed through.  I was given the ""privilege"" of touring a significant portion of the CDG ""airport"" on my seemingly endless journey.  It is a sight to behold!  Filled with twisting corridors, vague incomplete signage,  random temperature swings,  confused exiteable travellers, unidentifiable aromas, random security checks, and staff who are staunchly committed to teaching you self reliance. 

 After completing the scavenger hunt with the ""descriptive"" directions from the ""helpful"" staff consisting ENTIRELY of the words ""No"" and ""I don't know"" I arrived at a desk, guarding a door to the outside.  Above this mysterious door was a sign that read terminal 2B.  Next to me, across a rope barricade there were a hoard of travellers packed in a line of unknowable length that ended at the same enigmatic desk and door, and on their sign was marked only M.  

At random intervals an unmarked bus would charge up in front of The Door and screech to a halt, the driver would throw the bus door open with a unintelligible yell while furiously blowing his horn.  Out of thin air a staff member would materialize, The Door would burst open and the packed throng would rush forward. To this day I can still hear the pounding of feet clambering through The Door.  An uncountable number of busses would run this gauntlet yet the line had no end.  Finally after an age had passed a bus arrived, the driver yelled, the horn was blown and my quest continued.

I staggered, relived onto the bus with a few other weary travellers.  I had been in this monstrous escape room for ""only"" 4 hours following 9 hr flight and thought my journey was coming to a close.  I still had one hour to make it to the gate ""nothing"" could stop me now!  Little did I know The Ride had begun.  

I soon became apparent that this bus Ride was unlike any other I had experienced.  The path was not on the roads outside of the terminals but on the airport tarmac itself.  The bus driver haphazardly chose a path winding under gangways, around baggage trolleys, dodging other busses, box trucks, airport workers and AIRCRAFT.  At one point a full size commercial aircraft taxied in front of us.  This is all normal at Charles de Gaul, the airport design team must have consisted of Legos and a toddler.  The Ride finally reached its first stop at a random looking door in the side of what appeard to be a warehouse.  My hopes were dashed by the ""terminal 5"" sign that was so faded it was almost indistinguishable from the wall.  I checked the clock, 15 min had passed, I still had time.  But then I finally noticed the route placard.  Terminal 2B was the LAST STOP?!?  There were FOUR MORE STOPS BEFORE MINE!!  The trip between stops was ""estimated"" at 5 min by the placard, but the first stop took
10 minutes  to REACH!!!$#@%&*#‚ô§‚ô°‚óá‚òÜ%$¬°!!! OKOKOK..OK O..k  ok, it's ok, just breath..maybe the driver was going to speed up...but he was already driving like a Dachau rally driver!? Maybe the other stops were closer...yeah that must be it.  

NOPE!!  It took longer.   Stop after stop and my anxiety builds and builds.  The minutes tic by. 18 min, another stop. 25 min, stop.  32 min, stop. Finally after The Ride takes 43 min It screeches to a halt in front of the long sought after 2B.  I have 17 minutes to make the gate! The end of my quest! My journey through this purgatory could be at an end.  I rush off the bus, a new found vigor pumping through my arteries. I burst through the door!! I WILL TRIUMPH!!  
...dispair... shame... what a fool I am... as if I could escape my doom.  I can barely stand to tell this part, this tragedy. I can still see the soul crushing security check point in front of me to this day and I will never be the same.  

I can not continue this story today.  Suffice to say I did finally escape after a total of 10 hrs in that rotten hell-scape.  3 of those hrs were spent in the customer service line where I had to essentially strong arm the staff member into finding me a flight out.  I did not escape unharmed, my checked bag has fallen into the void, never to be seen again.

Disappointing,Toronto,Bangkok,International,"It was my first time travelling with Air France, and I must say, the experience wasn't great. First, the flight got cancelled when I was already in line to dispatch my baggage. The reason? The pilot was sick. This is unacceptable to me as the air company should have a reserve crew to prevent this kind of situation from happening. This was something preventable. They rescheduled us to the next available flight with a different air company. On the way back, we flew with Air France from Bangkok to Toronto, with a stop in France. On both flights, I called the cabin crew to request something, waited over 30 minutes, and they never came to my seat.

Additionally, Air France's instructions for boarding are inconsistent. While the plane itself was okay, it was not what I was expecting for the premium price that I initially paid, to later get downgraded and told I'm SOL.

Seriously  do AF believe they can compete with emirates, Qatar, turkish or even sister airline klm? No way. The tray is not appealing and unlike delta,  there is no white cloth or metal cutlery.  Then the plane looks old and the seat is super uncomfortable.
I usually fly premium because of the legroom and upgraded meal but AF sucks really. Breakfast is tasteless and the vacuum packed muffin or bread are hard to accept from a company that keeps on advertising French elegance...
Sorry, but though business class is hood, premium economy is bad. I have flown japan airlines , delta and klm and they all fo much better. Even regular eco  nomy on emirates or turkish is much  much better. I keep flying skyteam because I have platinum status since 2020 and will keep it for a third year but I really prefer other skyteam members when I fly long haul.",2023-10,2023-11-01,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,1.0

Flight was delayed but was able to make my connection and after boarding we had to wait an hr for departure , while the plane was better and new the food and service continued to be the same , looks like they no one ever thought them customer service and good attitude finally landed with 1 bag missing , Never going to fly them again.

Big No to Air France,Mumbai,Charleston,International,"Recently, I traveled from Mumbai to Charleston, USA, with a booking through Delta Airlines, which had a partner alliance with Air France for my connecting flight. While I understand the necessity of security checks, I was deeply disturbed by my experience at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris during the Air France portion of the journey.

After clearing initial security, I observed that Air France staff appeared to selectively target passengers with brown skin for additional checks before boarding the flight. It was disheartening to witness that these checks were not random but seemed to focus solely on individuals with brown skin. I couldn't help but ask why this was the case, and my question was met with a sarcastic response.

What's even more concerning is that security cameras are evidence of the fact that these checks were disproportionately conducted on people with brown skin. This experience left me feeling disappointed and saddened. It's essential that security measures are fair, unbiased, and not based on racial or ethnic profiling, regardless of the airline's partnership. We must stand together to challenge such instances and promote equality and respect for all travelers, regardless of their background.

Let's hope for a world where humility unites us, and such incidents do not divide us. #EqualityForAll #TravelExperiences

They charged me 55 euros and said I have to check my bag! My husband‚Äôs carry on was way lower the limit, they didn‚Äôt charge him but still told him to check his carry on as well!

"Bad communications, delayed flights, bad experience",Paris,Washington DC,International,"This airline has major communications issues leading to bad customer experiences. We flew AF from Basel, Switzerland to Washington, DC through Paris CDG. The Basel flight was delayed for 40 minutes, virtually ensuring we would not make our connecting flight in Paris. We spent over an hour in line waiting for AF customer service to rebook us.  Meantime, it turned out our Paris flight to Washington had also been delayed a hour,  but AF did not advise us of that, and when we had checked the status online it did not show any delay. We didn‚Äôt know about the delay until it was too late to even try to make the flight. 

AF gave us two lunch vouchers and booked us in a Ibis hotel for the night, with a flight  to Washington the next afternoon    We were told simply to walk from our location in terminal 2E to a spot outside between terminal 2B and 2D to get the Ibis shuttle. That walk turned out to be over a mile (about 4,000 steps on my husband‚Äôs tracker ).  When we finally found the waiting area, we waited outside for 2.5 hours for the shuttle to show.  I called the hotel at 4:30 to ask where the shuttle was, and was told they didn‚Äôt have shuttle service until 5:30. AF did not bother to tell us this important fact. We waited. The shuttle finally showed up around 6 pm. 

The hotel was much like a freshman dorm, very spartan and they turn off your AC based on date, not temperature. But the hotel service was good and buffet food that was included was fine. Since the hotel shuttle went back to the 2B area, we took a cab to the 2E departure terminal to avoid another long walk with luggage. Our expense, of course. 

Unfortunately, our departure gate did not connect to a plane. We had to wait for a bus to transport us a mile or so away to a tarmac, where we had to climb about 25 steps with our carry-on luggage in order to access the plane. Not surprisingly, those busses were also delayed. Boarding was confusing because AF did not announce boarding zones over the PA,  and the airport sign never changed from zone 2. AF signage also continued to show we were departing on time when, in fact, we still hadn‚Äôt even boarded the busses as of the listed departure time. 

This took place on a Friday when AF was supposedly on strike. We were told they are often on strike. Virtually everyone in our hotel was from cancelled or missed AF flights. We heard horror stories of people being told the wrong gates and unable to sprint the 10 gate difference in time, of large groups being denied boarding and missing flights although planes had not yet left the gate, of AF staff using tablets to provide info because signs were not updated, of a group having to fly to Los Angeles to get a connecting flight to their destination of Miami. Yes, in order not to wait nearly a week for another flight, they had to fly from Paris to Miami via Los Angeles.

AF seats were the tightest I had ever been on, and I‚Äôve flown United. Virtually no leg room. And not the friendliest group of stewards lol. So, the flight, after all the issues we had faced just to make it, offered nothing positive to change our opinion about AF. 

It‚Äôs hard to say how much the strike impacted AF service. Many people commented that AF ‚Äúalways seems to be on strike.‚Äù No clue. But we are not booking AF again.",2023-10,2023-10-15,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0

AIR FRANCE WORST FLIGHT EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE,Paris,Dallas,International,"Worst travel experience of my life on Air France‚Ä¶and I travel for a living! I recently flew with Air France in business class from Paris to DFW. Overall, it was a very disappointing experience that did not meet my expectations IN THE SLIGHTEST. On October 6th, I boarded our flight from Paris to DFW, however the boarding experience has scarred me forever. All of my gear that I travel with (and traveled to Paris with) was in my suitcase. Many people brought their suitcases on, but what appeared to be a breech of authority, they forced me to check my bag. When checking in, the ladies at the kiosk were extremely rude and almost made me miss my flight. They made me pay an extra $60, even though my bag was a carry on and fit perfectly overhead. They got so upset about me asking questions that they threatened to call the cops and even said they weren‚Äôt going to allow me to get on the flight. I took a picture of my receipt and they FREAKED out thinking I took a photo of them. I was so confused and said ‚Äúwtf is going on?‚Äù And they called the cops! Saying it‚Äôs hate speech towards them. I literally almost got arrested. I had no idea I couldn‚Äôt express myself and ask questions and when I said a cuss word they acted like I was doing it towards them! They then wrote all my info down and proceeded to act like I was a criminal. I cried and begged for them to let me just pay and go. I RAN through the airport to make this flight which they were closing the doors when I arrived. Our plane was then delayed 45 minutes. Once on the plane, I saw many many passengers with bags larger than mine. As far as the flight itself, there was limited recline and lacking amenities. The meal service was terrible - a small cold pasta salad and no appetizer or dessert. Upon arriving at DFW, I had to wait over an hour for my bags. Luckily I had an air tag in my bag to know where it was. However, when I checked after waiting 30 minutes, I was alarmed to find my bag STILL IN PARIS!!! I had to return to the airport at 11:30pm when Air France sent the bags on a later flight. Overall, Air France's dirty seats, lack of amenities, mediocre food, and mismanaged baggage handling made this a terrible experience. I‚Äôve never in my life experienced something like this and will never be flying with them again. I would not recommend flying Air France, based on this disappointing experience.",2023-10,2023-10-09,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Air France is incompetent,Chicago,Valletta,International,"Air France was by far the worst airline I‚Äôve ever flown. When we made it to Paris, we had a connecting flight to Malta. No Air France worker would help us print our boarding pass and help us find our gate. We were sent to 7 different counters and each one sent us in a tailspin, different buses, buildings and lines. Not one of those resulted in us getting a boarding pass and after 2 hours we missed the flight along with 6 others from different cities who had the same experience. We then had to wait in another 2 hours line to get us on another flight and the Air France manager was so incredibly rude to us. It was our first trip to Paris as a friends group and it was awful. We had been up 24 hours, no shower, needing water, phone‚Äôs battery dying and they wanted us to pay to book another flight, also pay $275 euros for our luggage and pay for our own taxi to the other Paris Orly airport.

DO NOT EVER IN YOUR LIFETIME BOOK WITH AIR FRANCE.,Florence,Chicago,International,"Coming back from Florence to Chicago on Air France was a nightmare I will spend the rest of my life trying to repress. 
When we landed in Paris (CDG), we were sky priority and they ushered all zones after us ahead of us. When we finally made it through boarding, the AirFrance reps forced my mom to go through an unnecessary thorough search of her carryon bag and made her undress. Touching her without our consent but we just wanted to get on our plane and go home to the US.
Landing in Chicago (ORD) my mom and I as well as almost a hundred other upset travelers waited over THREE hours in baggage claim for our luggage. Right away we received three of our bags but not the fourth that had the majority of our clothes toiletries and shoes. When asking the rude, horrible communicator Air France rep standing at baggage claim if our luggage was on the list of missing baggage, we were told no that our luggage had arrived in Chicago so we waited another hour and then when the lane shut down and we still didn‚Äôt have our luggage we asked her again and she told us our name WAS on the list of missing luggage!!! We waited around for FOUR hours for luggage that was never going to show up. She proceeded to scream at us saying she did let us know our name was on the list as we expressed our frustration over the fact that she told us it was on the list brushing us off and told us to fill out a claim for missing luggage. We will NEVER use AirFrance again and we will be sure to warn everyone we know to never use this airline. Truly the worst travel experience we have ever had. So many people missed there connecting flights because of an EXTREME error on Air France‚Äôs part and they refused to rebook traveler‚Äôs flights on their dime. This company is full of crooks and mean unbelievably RUDE representatives.

AIRFRANCE NOT FIT FOR PURPOSE,Paris,Hong Kong,International,"Our first issue started on arrival at Paris. We arrived on a connecting flight from Amsterdam (even though we paid a premium price to fly direct from Amsterdam to Hong Kong, but that is another story). On arrival, we went to pick up our 14 month old sons push chair, which we had been promised would be waiting for us in Paris, only to be told that it had been sent on to Hong Kong. This wouldn't have been too much trouble had it not been for the fact that we now had an 11 hour wait time to catch our flight to Hong Kong. We were sent from one department to the next only to be sent back and forth, absolutely ZERO empathy or assistance from almost all departments. The one exception being a very friendly young woman at the AirFrance Baggage counter, who went out of her way to find a rickety old buggy for us to borrow, as we killed time in Paris centre, which we were extremely grateful for, having just been treated so terribly be all the other AirFrance staff. We were then loaded on to our plane (which was absolutely roasting), only to be told that our flight had been delayed. So we sat in the plane, cooking alive, while they sorted out an issue with the cargo hold. Once the flight took off, the temperature got hotter, to the point where it was unbearable. I asked the flight staff why it was so hot, and if they could do something about it, which was met with blank expressions and no help whatsoever. Our baby boy was sweating so much, he couldn't get comfortable at all. For the entire flight, the only respite from the heat we got, was when the curtains separating business class and economy class were opened, which let in a cold blast of air. 
The food was disgusting. The pasta was dry, the bread rolls were so hard that they could be used to build a house out off or maybe used as a weapon. The flight attendants only seemed to care about the French speaking passengers and were arrogant and unhelpful to anyone else.
On arrival at Hong Kong, we went to collect our baggage, only to find out that our suitcase containing all of our clothes, toiletries and nappies for our baby ( which we had been promised in Paris, had already been loaded on to the plane for Hong Kong) had gone missing. So there we were in Hong Kong at 8pm, with just the very sweaty clothes on our back and a limited supply of nappies for our baby. On talking to the baggage desk in Hong Kong ( whom all were very friendly and helpful) we found out that the suitcase had not left Paris at all.
I couldn't be any more disappointed in a service, especially one that cost so much, yet failed to deliver on all aspects.
I strongly advise you to steer clear of traveling with AirFrance and be careful when your flight  changes through KLM, as this is why we were forced to fly with AirFrance anyway.

In the international terminal there is not a single restaurant to relax, sit down, have a drink and eat. There are two tiny ""healthy food"" spots with disgusting pre-made sandwiches that you warm up in a microwave (overpriced, of course). This is the international zone where people have 8 hour layovers. There's also no comfortable seating to sleep.

Now let's get into Air France. They changed our gate about 30 min before take-off and didn't make an announcement. We had to sprint to the new gate and almost missed our flight. When we asked the staff member why they didn't make an announcement, she shrugged her shoulders as though this was our problem. 

Then on the plane, the flight attendants harassed a poor mother beside us for the entire flight because her 4-year-old child was sleeping in his seat. They told her if he fell asleep, he had to be on her lap. He was only allowed to sit in his seat if he was awake. I've never seen anything like this - it was completely unbelievable and I felt so bad for the woman (this was an 8 hour flight and she had to keep a large child on her lap, despite having paid for an extra seat for him). So rude and inconsiderate.",2023-09,2023-09-17,2.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0
Lost luggage and delayed flight on Air France,Detroit,Rome,International,"We flew from Detroit, Michigan to Rome with a layover in Paris. After having booked this flight, our friends and relatives told us that Air France is notorious for delayed flights and losing luggage. The flight to Paris was ok, but once we arrived in Paris, we boarded the connecting flight to Rome, and we were stuck on the runway for over 1 hour. There was no apparent reason for this delay as the weather was nice. The plane's Captain also became frustrated, and announced over the loud speaker ""we are being held hostage by the French."" Once we arrived in Rome and waited for our luggage for over 2 hours, it was apparent it was lost. The representative for Air France kept assuring us that our luggage was there, and to just keep waiting. Finally the lazy representative agreed to check on the status of our luggage, and discovered it never left Detroit. The luggage was delivered us 3 days later, but we had to spend 3 days of our vacation time without it. We had to purchase new items at our expense. Once I got back to America after our 23 day vacation, I called Air France to file a complaint. A few weeks later they responded by saying I did not file the complaint within their 21 day time frame allowed, so my complaint was in valid. I was in Italy was no Internet or phone service to call or contact them. Their 21 day limit for a complaint is unfair. A large amount of travelers exceed 21 days on their trip. Please do NOT fly with Air France.! They will only cause you headaches and frustrations! I certainly will never fly with Air France again!!",2023-08,2023-09-17,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Don‚Äôt fly with Air France if you have a connecting flight,London,Antananarivo,International,"We travelled with Air France for our honeymoon from London to Madagascar via Paris. The flight and service was fine but on arrival at Madagascar we were told they had forgotten our luggage at Paris. They would not be able to get them across until the following night and we were booked on a tour around Madagascar leaving the morning after we arrived.

The team at the airport said they could not get our luggage across to us as we would be too far away by the time it arrived so we had to organise ourselves and pay to get it transferred (¬£300). Luckily this went to plan and we managed to enjoy the rest of the holiday.

Having spoken to others on the tour and the tour guide Air France appears to be a repeat offender for this. Two others had had their luggage lost before and the tour team report they regularly have someone who has their luggage lost and it is always Air France.

Having returned 21 days later I submitted a claim and was told because I hadn‚Äôt submitted this worthing 21 days of this incident (when we had minimal acres to internet and no access to a computer) they will not reimburse us.

Average Experience,London,Nice,Europe,"I flew from London to Nice at the end of August and back in the middle of September.
The flight was delayed in London and it went on time from Nice. We were asked to put the hand luggage into the hold luggage which is not great as it added another hour to my overall flight experience and plus an hour delay in London.
On the flight back they gave a biscuit and a small drink. I just wonder how are the prices justified if there is nothing superior in the flying experience. 
I think it should be standard to treat your customers nicely if something doesn't go according to plan. If the flight is slightly delayed a drink can be offered as a tiny compensation for the inconvenience. To give a biscuit on the plane is mean in my humble opinion as the flight is quite early from Nice 06:50 and people don't have a chance to have a proper breakfast.

Horrific holiday and horrific customer service by Airfrance,Manchester,Monastir,International,"I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with the service provided by Air France over the past three months. Despite multiple attempts to seek assistance, my experience with your customer care team has been a nightmare.

From the outset, Air France customer care team demonstrated unprofessionalism and a lack of respect. My attempts to obtain updates on my case were consistently ignored and dismissed. What's particularly disheartening is the complete absence of acknowledgment from Air France regarding my efforts to seek a resolution.

It is a basic courtesy for any reputable airline to acknowledge and address customer concerns, especially when services are not being provided to paying customers. However, I have been left in the dark, questioning whether Air France cares about the inconvenience and frustration I've endured all these months.

This treatment is unacceptable, and it's crucial for Air France to take responsibility and provide the service that customers deserve.

"Why do you assign unhappy agents to the ""Priority Check-in"" counter to greet happy travelers?",Montreal,Paris,International,"I checked in online and arrived at the Pierre Elliot Trudeau airport 45 minutes early to upgrade to business /or/ first class depending on availability.  I was so happy to see all 3 agents working in ""Priority check in"" free.  No customers to serve.
I approached one agent, she asked to see my ticket which I showed her.  I told her I want to upgrade.  She replied, with a stern look, and said ""come back at 7"". The time was 6:15 pm.  She would not listen to anything I said thereafter ignoring me as though I did not exist.  Another client arrived who was scheduled on an earlier flight, she allowed him to check in an extra luggage for free.  I responded by saying that was such a nice gesture on her behalf, and it would be appreciated if that kindness spread to others like me....to please give me a solution. No response.  I went to the next agent who was a little more helpful and told me to try the upgrade on the machine.  (Even though there were no other customers to serve). I went to the self-operated check in machine and succeed to find the seats I wanted ÔÅä BUT it would not accept any credit card and redirected me to the counter.  I went back, again ALL 3 agents were FREE. -they said they cannot help.  I became angry.  Another client came with the same situation.  Yet that client had already her business class tickets.  She was treated the same way.  She said she had ‚Äúnever‚Äù seen such service.
Ok now its 7pm.  I am waiting to enter priority check in-no one is there to serve the clients!!!   The economy class is whizzing by‚Ä¶.the ones in ‚ÄúPriority are waiting to be served.

Big Disappointment,Budapest,Washington DC,International,"This was my first time on Air France and it was quite a disappointment. We arrived at the airport at 9:15 AM for 12:15 PM flight. They tell you to arrive 3 hours early for an international flight. The que to check in was backed up to the door. This was because no one was working the Air France counters. The airport was hot and people were testy having to wait. The workers finally showed up just before 10:00. We had premier economy seats. The seats reclined so far back that it was virtually impossible for someone on an inner seat to get out. At my request the flight attendant asked the woman in front of me to move her seat so I could get out to the bathroom. What genius designed these seats? They served a good bit of food but most of it was inedible. I asked for soda and was given a dixie cup glass of soda and no ice was available. They had curtains separating our section of seats from business class on one side and economy on the other side. This made it difficult to get to the bathroom as we did not have one in our section. The flight was delayed on the ground for 1 hour because they said that suitcases had to be removed for people who weren't on the flight which made no sense to me. When we transferred to our second Air France flight they had us walk down a ramp and stand and wait in the heat for 20 minutes before we could board. Based on this experience I do not recommend Air France.

"Unprofessional and racist airline, never again",Warsaw,Nairobi,International,"As a frequent traveler I sadly have to admit that Air France is the worst airline I had come across so far (including non EU Airlines like Egypt Air). 
Our flight was cancelled 24h before the date of take off due to demonstrations (we had layover in Paris). 
Firstly they booked us on another flight, which was extra long (took extra day) and had one more layover (2 instead of one). Finally we were able to convince help dear to book us in a different flight, while they were responding every 2h. 
Secondly me (European) as well as my fianc√©e (Kenyan) wrote claim to get our compensation. Air France reached out to me within 2 weeks from submitting the claim, while he had to wait for over a month (racism? Possible‚Ä¶), moreover, they wanted to compensate him for flight form Helsinki to Amsterdam (we were not flying anywhere close to that route) and that compensation would be 250‚Ç¨ instead of 600‚Ç¨ that he should rightfully get. 
Their customer care is scandalously bad if you‚Äôre not European clearly‚Ä¶
And lastly the food in Air France‚Ä¶ we‚Äôll, if you have early morning flight, just ensure you are coming full, our flight took off at 6am (meaning we had to be at the airport around 3:30 - 4am), lasted around 2-2.5h (with airport waiting time it gives us 4-5h and for ‚Äúbreakfast‚Äù we got one round biscuit (diagonal around 3cm) and a coffe/tea, for a flight we paid around 1000$. 
This was most likely the last time flying with this airline, I‚Äôm extremely disappointed and outraged on how they treat people.",2023-07,2023-08-24,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0
"AirFrance La Premiere First Class ~ Sublime, and perfection- elevated",Paris,Washington DC,International,"Lets get started.  First of all, let me just say that the AirFrance ground experience was... sublime.  We flew in from Italy to Paris in AF business, first row, to connect to the  La Premi√®re segment which was CDG-IAD.  Our flight was about an hour late leaving Rome and the walking time between the terminals was going to be extremely tight as the flight crew told us it could easily take over an hour, and possibly as long as 90 minutes, and we had just under 2 hours till take off. As we pulled up to the gate, my wife and I gathered our carry-ons and stood ready to blow out the door as soon as it opened and start that agonizing walk over to the other terminal.

As soon as the door opened, an Air France stepped into the a320 and spoke briefly with the onboard crew and they pointed us out and motioned us forward.  Camille, our ground rep introduced herself, asked if she could please take my wife's carry-on, and asked us to please follow her.

We stepped off the plane, but instead of walking up the airbridge ramp toward the terminal as expected, she walked over to an elevator just a few steps out of the plane.  We entered the elevator and she punched in the ground floor and in just a few seconds the door opened right out on to the tarmac. We stepped out and parked just under the jet bridge was a beautiful black BMW 7-series with another  Air France rep, who introduced himself as Antoine, holding the rear door open for us.  As we stepped in he took my carry-on, and after we were in the car he placed our carry-ons in the BMW boot, held the front door for Camille to sit in the front passenger seat, and he got in the drivers seat and started off.

Camille told us we would have time to spend 'an hour- maybe a bit more' in the La Premiere lounge and asked if we would like to go.  That was a big YES!

After no more than 3-4 minutes we parked and were escorted out of the BMW, and into the private check-in lounge, and then into the absolutely beautiful La Premi√®re lounge.  Camille seated us in a plush love seat, and asked for our passports and told us she would take care of our check in while we enjoyed a glass of champagne which was already being walked over to us before we could even hand Camille the passports.

There are numerous reviews of the La Premi√®re lounge so I wont go into any other detail here, but I'll just just it was impeccable in every way.  The lunge was very quiet, with perhaps just 5 or 6 other passengers, soft music, and the lounge staff.  They were also impeccably dressed, exceedingly professional and polite, and provided us with world class service for food & drinks over the following 70 minutes of our stay. Champagne, warm Lobster with clarified butter, Foie Gras, incredible cheeses, an bread, and of course some fabulous French Margaux red to finish off our last few minutes there.

Just as we finished up, Camille came over and asked if we were ready to leave to our flight, and she and another driver took our carry-ons and escorted us back outside, this time to a black Mercedes sedan.

I expected us to be taken to the departure terminal and then over to our gate for boarding, but instead, we drove straight to the beautiful 777-300 and parked just under the wing.  Camille told us we would be boarding directly up and into the air bridge.   As we were walking over to the door I stopped to admire the 777 and Camille asked if she could take a photo for us.

She got several amazing shots of us right there on the tarmac with that magnificent airship behind us- shots I never tire of looking at from time to time.

So up the airbridge and straight on board where Camille introduced us to the Chief Purser and our personal attendant Marie.

On the 777-300 there are only 4 seats in first.  My wife and I had the middle two and there was no one else in the first class cabin. 

 Somehow, they knew we were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary.  We told the ticketing agent in Rome, but that's it.  She gushed over us, so I'm assuming she made some kind of note in our flight records.  Within moments of being seated Marie was offering us a 2006 Piper-Heidsieck Rare which she opened with reserved professional grace as we settled into the amazing first class seats.

After no more than 5 or 6 minutes, Camille came over to us with a gentleman in uniform, who she introduced as Girard  our Captain.  He greeted us warmly, asked if we had flown AF before, told us he had been with them for 17 years, and that it was on honor to serve us on this special anniversary.

Wow.  Just WOW.

After the captain left us to head back to the flight deck Camille said she was waiting for confirmation all of our checked luggage had transferred from the Rome flight and that she would check back as soon as the had that.

About 10 minutes after that she came back to our seats and profusely apologized for the inconvenience, but one of our 3 checked bags was not on the plane yet and that they were doing an urgent trace on it, and that she would not leave us until the bag was located and on the plane. 

At this point we were only 15 minutes or so from the scheduled departure time of 1.55pm.  At 2pm she returned and told us they had located the bag and it was being driven directly to the plane!  At 2.05 she came back once again, all smiles and told us all of the bags were now in the hold, told us it was her pleasure to have served us today, and asked us to please consider La Premier again whenever possible, and said farewell and happy anniversary again with a warm handshake for me an a hug and three kisses for my wife.

The remainder of our time on the flight was no less spectacular than the entire ground experience.  After the stunning caviar service, followed by a world-class meal, Marie closed off the curtains on both sides and we had complete and total privacy - like a small elegant suite in the sky until it was time for the pre-landing meal service.

I have travelled well, and often, and this was without exception the most exquisite service, attention and care we have ever experienced. 

So- it was not my original plan to go into such detail, but once I started thinking back on this trip, I just felt it was important to really try to capture the experience as best I could. If possible you should absolutely experience AirFrance La Premiere  before First Class is just a memory of days gone by (which may not be more than a few years off the way things are going these days).

My experiences on emirates and ethiad were also absolutely fantastic and I still encourage others to try them all, but the AirFrance experience was one for the history books.",2022-09,2023-08-23,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

NEVER FLY AIR FRANCE.....NOT AN AIRLINE FOR SENIORS,Yaounde,Dallas,International,"Air France in recent years has become some what of a Hot Mess. In looking to purchase a ticket for my mom who is a senior citizen (one-way ticket), the goal was to get a ticket with the shortest transit time, especially since she was going to be traveling by herself. I purchased a one-way economy ticket for almost $1,800.....yes you read it right, almost One Thousand and eight hundred dollars. Her initial flight had a total transit time in Paris of about 4-hours. Two days prior to her flight, we received a notification that her flight had been moved from 08/22/23 to 08/23/23 with a new transit time of about 20-hours. No explanation was given what so ever. If you have a Parent traveling, especially by themselves, I Strongly Advise Against Using this airline. I have flown Air France for about 10-years, but it takes just one bad experience to sour everything up. As of now, my 70-year old mother, who is already somewhat terrified of traveling alone, will be stuck in Paris by herself for almost 20-hours!

Never fly with Air France,Frankfurt,Malaga,Europe,"My wife and I , had a flight from Malaysia to Frankfurt, and after that, we have a flight from Frankfurt to Malaga by France Airline (which was supposed flight from Frankfurt to Paris and from there to Malaga) to visit my family. our flight supposes to leave at 18:30 but they delayed until 10:30, first of all, air France staff do not provide any correct information, and they don't entertain or answer our questions regarding our connecting flight! they just said you go Paris then they will solve the problem. 
In the end, the flight landed at 22:00 and they ask us to get on board immediately with all the push we were on the plane by 23:00 and then the captain announced because Frankfurt roles can not take off after 23:00. 
 after that, we went back to the check-in area, and again the staff ask us to go and stay in a hotel and the airline will pay the penalty and pay for everything else such as dinner and a taxi, and also give us a new ticket. 
For us because it will take a long time we just bought the new ticket with another airline next (direct) and we asked for a refund (which we got) but regarding the hotel and taxi and the penalty which they mentioned themself until now we sent more than 10 emails they not accept it and do not want to give the payment, 
Also after this, they did not give back our bags to us because they said the airport is closed and we can just fly on the next date and they will give the bags to another airline which they never did! and we lost all our bags for 15 days! anyhow the new airline accept the mistake but all this happened to us because of a non-responsible, unorganized, and not reliable airline named Air France

üëé Extremely Disappointed with Air France's Handling of Lost Items üëé,Toronto,Cairo,International,"I am beyond frustrated with the utter lack of responsibility shown by Air France in handling the situation regarding my lost items during a recent trip. It's truly astonishing how a company of your stature could handle customer concerns so poorly.

Let me be clear: the laughable compensation offer of $860.7 for items worth well over $4500 is a slap in the face. And spare me the excuse that I should have kept individual receipts for each item among the ten pieces of luggage. The incompetence of your baggage handling directly led to the loss of these items, and yet you seem to think that a mere fraction of their value is sufficient compensation.

What's more, the complete absence of any meaningful response since my initial message is appalling. I had explicitly requested escalation and a comprehensive approach to finding a solution. Instead, I'm met with silence, leaving me no choice but to voice my frustration here.

Air France, you need to step up and take responsibility for your mistakes. This situation has caused a great deal of inconvenience and distress, and your dismissive attitude only adds insult to injury. I demand immediate acknowledgment of this review and a concrete plan of action to resolve this matter fairly. If you continue to neglect your obligations, rest assured that I will not hesitate to pursue all available legal avenues to seek justice.

Your lack of professionalism and disregard for your customers is truly disgraceful.",2023-06,2023-08-18,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
Unfair charging for carry-on bag and gangster-like staff,Paris,London,Europe,"At CDG, here was a burly, gangster-like man standing in front of the passport check line wearing an armband, claiming to represent Air France.  Even though my carry-on bag was under the weight limit as specified in my ticket, he forced me to check in the bag and pay extra for it. As I had barely enough time to make it to my flight (which involved an important connection at Heathrow to another flight to the US), I didn't have the time to reason with him and therefore had no choice but to pay under duress. I flew on several other airlines during this European trip, and my bag had no problem with any of them.

Discrimination and arbitrary standards with weigh of cabin luggage,Paris,Lisbon,Europe,"At Charles de Gaulle airport, AirFrance contracts ""Securitas"" agents that work for them, that discriminately and arbitrarily ask some passangers to weigh the cabin luggage (and if you do not look european, there are more chances of being checked). 
They are rude and arrogant and if you ask their identification to submit a complaint, they refuse to say their name.
They have zero tolerance, even with older passangers, and if your luggage is 0.1 kg above the 12kg allowed, they ask you to check-in the cabin luggage, paying the fees.
AirFrance should apply the same strict standards it applies with the cabin luggage weigh with the schedules of the flights, which most of the times have a big delay.

One of our bags (mine) was displaced, and we spent our whole honeymoon preoccupied worrying about it. We were told it would get to us on one of our cruise stops. Each day we waited, and it never showed. We spent time each day purchasing items that I needed to make our trip comfortable- this was supposed to be one of the most romantic trips of our lives. To say the luggage debacle put a damper on things would be a slight understatement. We know things happen, we tried not to let it ruin our holiday, and trudged forward. Only to return and get our luggage back. But NOW, the AIRLINE is dragging their feet at reimbursement for items we were forced to purchase (5 outfits, and hair product $400.00 USD) not an unreasonable request. I can‚Äôt get any answers and speaking to an actual person is nonexistent. Unless you want headaches and hassles, I‚Äôd say pass on KLM/Air France.",2023-06,2023-08-09,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0

We were attnding a wedding and all our items were 3 days late. We had to replace wedding clothes and gifts and AF's response has been pitiful. They have not replied to emails, ignored receipts provided and failed to recognise their failures. They admitted to losing tarck of 15,000 items when their server crashed on June 14. When we could not submit a claim beacuse the server was down we went to their office. They took ourdetails, said they would log the loss and call us - they did not!

Almost left me stranded in Shanghai,Melbourne,Paris,International,"Air France was unable to issue boarding passes for both legs of the long haul flight I booked with them, almost leaving me stranded in Shanghai.

I booked return flights with Air France between Melbourne and Paris only to find out later that part of the service (between Melbourne and Shanghai) would be a China Eastern flight. Apparently Air France and China eastern are partners or something.

When I checked in they could not issue boarding passes for both legs of the flight because they were being delivered by different carriers, even tho I booked both flights with Air France.

As a result, I had to get a second boarding pass in Shanghai. This meant I had to actually enter Shanghai with an emergency visa, run to the check in desk to check in, then renter the airport via security.

By the time I got through customs etc I had to run to the check in desk, I made it with only minutes to spare, and the Air France staff at the desk were angry with me for checking late.

The only reason I made it at all is because one of the customs guys at the airport took pity on me because I was almost in tears and he let me jump the line.

What‚Äôs worse is I was unable to get on the Wi-Fi at Shanghai without a Chinese number or address so couldn‚Äôt call anyone for help. What a nightmare.

Thank god I didn‚Äôt have any checked baggage or there‚Äôs no way I would have made it.

I now have to do the same thing on the way back (I.e. exit and reenter at Shanghai to get my second boarding pass).

I asked the flight attendants on the return flight if they could allow me to disembark first given the situation and how close I was to not making it last time. They said they couldn‚Äôt do this because ‚Äòit‚Äôs difficult‚Äô.

Needless to say I will not be flying Air France again. Not worth the stress.",2023-08,2023-08-05,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
Do not fly AirFrance unless you‚Äôre looking for a nightmare,Florence,New York City,Domestic,"AirFrance cancelled multiple flights hours before check in. Their explanation: ‚Äúwe just took the flight off the schedule.‚Äù They ‚Äòrebooked‚Äô us on a flight that took away our change to get a good nights sleep before traveling by having us leave for the airport hours earlier only to find out they weren‚Äôt even in partnership with the airline they rebooked us with. They also didn‚Äôt reissuing our tickets so we went to the airport at 3am with no ability to fly out. We tried multiple times to get in touch with them while at the airport, each time they lied to us. They disconnected the line from us and eventually the line was closed, leaving us completely stranded at an airport were not even sure we‚Äôll fly out of. Do not fly with them. Horrible business values and even worse customer service strategy. Even the in person AirFrance staff at the airport was unwilling to help.

 We booked wheelchairs for parents at CDG.  Worst experience for them.  Were made to stand for 1 elevator, then made to stand in a bus, then walk and wait while standing.  Very bad accessibility accommodations.  

Refused any kind of refund or consideration because flights were out of European jurisdiction.  They are an international career but will not give inconvenience refunds when inconvenience is caused.

Although the Captain and the crew profusely apologized for the delay, I think if the boarding is complete on time, then I see no reason why the flight should be delayed. The Vegetarian meal option in Business class was ok. Nothing that I would be too excited about. The equipment (B777) looked dated and had cracks in the plastics in business class.

The worst airline ever,Paris,Bogota,International,"I traveled from Brussels train station to Paris and from Paris to Bogota. It was sold to me as combined ticket for a connection from Brussels via Official Air France website. I did the check in at a special Air France terminal at Midi station, and continued my journey to do the security check in Paris. I was stopped at security check due to my luggage, I had a hand luggage and a accessory which was accepted in Brussels Midi Air France terminal. At the CDG airport, I was pushed and shouted at that I cannot take the luggage with me, the workers did not speak English and they were shouting to me in French... I felt terrible and stressed out, and I did not know what was the problem. I was showing them the ticket that I have received already at Midi station, and they said they do not care, that now I have to pay 220 euros for my luggage. I tried to talk to a supervisor, I was ignored and shouted at. The workers were more than rude towards me... They did not want to listen and they said they do not care... A pitty I was not recording all of those people. No one wanted to help me, and everybody were sending me from one person to another. Finally I decided, to do the check in procedure for my hand luggage and what occured: that I don't need to pay anything extra, that it was accepted at the customs checks at Midi Station. Yet they still denied me taking it on board with me, shouting at me and pushing me. I will officially complain at the treatment I have received.

"Rudest, most disrespectful personnel and delays! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",Paris,New York City,International,"Absolute worst airline out of all the American, Asian, and European carriers. Worst customer service and absolute shame on Air France for representing France in the worst manner. They are the epitome of rude, disrespectful, and arrogant. Funny enough, my partner is actually a French citizen and was treated super disrespectfully In his home country. Their staff is extremely incompetent, slow, and inefficient. They demanded and insisted on charging us specifically for all of our luggage - both of our hand carries and check ins - which ended up in an excess charge of 300 euros! When my partner remarked, if we were going to be charged so much, we might as well fly first class, they snary remarked that we wouldn‚Äôt be able to afford it. I‚Äôm sorry Mademoiselle with the hair that had so much hairspray that could be a fire hazard, but do you have insight on our double income household? How could you possibly know our income bracket? And how much do YOU make to be so arrogant? Personnel was also extremely incompetent and lacked common sense as well. They spoke in poor English to my partner as well poor French to me (I was speaking English and I‚Äôm American). They then realized they got it wrong and had to adjust their language.

Hard-sided Luggage damaged,Amsterdam,Bilbao,Europe,"We planned a European vacation for a year.  We arranged to go to New York City to ease into the time change.  We flew from NYC to Amsterdam on Delta and changed planes to go to Bilbao, Spain, our first stop.  When we received our luggage we found our large suitcase cracked from top to bottom.  We immediately went to the KLM/Air France baggage office and showed the damaged luggage.  They provided us with an instruction sheet on how to make a claim.  We went to our local hotel and went online to file the claim.  

We were traveling through 7 different countries and were notified through email of the progress of the claim.   The claim company asked where they could send a replacement bag.  Since we had left Spain and were traveling in Italy, we gave our USA address.  The claim company stated that they did not deliver to the USA and we would need to go back to Spain.  We had many conversations, both verbal and email, about how this was impossible.  

We finally arrived back in the USA and contacted KLM.  They took the claim again not using the original their staff had told us to complete.  The final result was that KLM now claims we filed too late and were required to do this in the first  days.  KLM/Air France is not recognizing the claim filed with the company their staff told us to.

This is the second time KLM/Air France has damage our luggage.  The first time was not as bad and I had it fixed here in the USA.  Obviously, KLM/Air France does not care how they handle your luggage.  The luggage was hard sided and we had never had any issues with any of our luggage on any other airline before.

We had to buy a new bag in Bilbao to finish our travels.

Worst Flight Ever,Venice,Sydney,International,"Organised tour with Qantas codeshare flights with Air France. Could not check in at Sydney airport as Air France had cancelled the flight, locked the tickets and Qantas could not access until 2 hours before departure. Numerous late cancellations and changes before we even left the ground. Departed from Venice to Sydney & assured by Air France staff at checking that all flights were in order. Despite being told that they would give us our boarding pass for the Singapore- Sydney leg when we arrived in Singapore. Arrived in Paris to change planes to Singapore and had 20 mins to get across the airport to the gate - which had already closed. I sprinted to the gate but others could not, very stressful. We land in Singapore & are told by Air France staff at the transit gate that we don‚Äôt have a ticket home to Sydney but they are sorting it out. We contacted our travel agent who booked it & were reassured that we did. She emailed through the ticket which was a flight from Venice - HongKong - Sydney.  Air France had rescheduled the flight, not told us, their staff had checked us in at Venice Airport on a ticket that didn‚Äôt exist. So then we sat at the transit gate for 7 hours all the while being reassured by Air France staff that they were sorting it out. Approximately 7 hours later Air France staff advised us that they couldn‚Äôt help us and we should make our own way home. This was at 11pm on a Saturday night in Singapore airport. We then had to go through immigration, reclaim our bags & find a flight home. Of course by this time the bags had been taken off the carousel and ‚Äúcould not be located‚Äù. When we did eventually get home on our own, at great expense, Air France denied any problem with ticketing or any responsibility. Our travel agent denied any responsibility because Air France had taken over the tickets. Air France accused us of changing the ticket (which we did not) , then they advised us that they had notified us of the ticket change (they did not). Funny that Air France checked us in at Venice to Singapore, if they had changed the ticket to Venice - Hong Kong. The itinerary is a joke - we were due to leave Hong Kong before we left Venice. I could go on, but think you get the jist of it. Unless you too want this experience on your next holiday - I would choose a more reliable & professional airline.",2023-04,2023-07-29,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
Hung Out To Dry Beware,Paris,Venice,Europe,"our flight from France to Italy was cancelled by air France on 6/28/2023 we were due to board at 7 am the following morning the night before said they had operational issues. Air France was not successful in their attempt to get us abord one for their planes leaving that same day. so, they wound up booking us on another airline Easy Jet. we had a cruise leaving Italy the following day, so we had to take the flight. the original cost of the flight was $384.81. we wound up having to pay $2386.50. for the same flight economy seats just a different airline same day. upon returning from vacation, we contacted air France to seek a cost adjustment for the seats we had to book due to their cancellation the call center rep. after repeated calls disconnections, hang ups. told me that the tickets were not refundable. i told him we were not seeking a refund of the tickets. we just wanted to have our cost adjusted to what the original ticket purchase price was. he said no the tickets were not refundable. the call center rep made no attempt to resolve the cost issues caused by their cancellation of the original flight. so, anyone who happens to read this review beware. it seems as if this is part of their business model to cancel flights on a regular basis and leave you hung out to dry on any cost issues that may come up due their operational issues.",2023-06,2023-07-29,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0

Don‚Äôt fly AF if you have a connection and checked in luggage! They don‚Äôt know how to handle changes!,West Palm Beach,Paris,International,"After a missed connection in Atlanta, it was very hard to get on the next available flight. I got lucky at the gate of the next flight that evening thanks to the team on the ground.

The challenge is the luggage that didn‚Äôt make it. I knew that due to the missed connection it would be delayed in any case‚Ä¶ but it has now been 7 days.

While Delta has a fantastic tracking tool, AF is not up to par! I have arrived 7 days ago, the bagage has been at CDG for 5 days now‚Ä¶ but their response is that the team hasn‚Äôt confirmed it.

Calling a call center daily is useless. The agents are not given an estimated time for luggage delivery. They are professional but not given the tools to handle customer‚Äôs claims.

It is crazy that after so many years having the same challenge at CDG they are not able to get it right!

I have been a fervent supporter of AF, I will make sure to never take a connecting flight through that company with checked luggage! Not worth the money and lack of respect of their customer!

Mixed experiences,Toronto,Paris,International,"I have flown a few times with Air France, both in Business Class and Economy. Most trips were great, although a bit overpriced for the value overall.

Disturbingly, during my last flight there were frequent last minute gate changes, leading to a missed flight for myself and at least 6 other passengers, at minimum. We were all at Customer Service waiting for a resolution to the issue. I wonder why Air France did not take notice as to why so many people checked in through Customs at the airport and were yet not available to board the flight? They would have perhaps thought to page the passengers and collect them. This did not happen.

Air France gave the next available flight, however did NOT provide a voucher for a hotel. Customer Service was also far too lengthy; more staff should have been available to service us. 

France is a lovely place to visit, however there are many airlines that fly out of this airport so do your research if you want to avoid stress.",2023-07,2023-07-28,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0

Aggressive and irresponsible airline,Vancouver,Yerevan,International,"After an 11 hour flight, then a 6 hour layover in Paris, Air France rejected my boarding pass when scanned for boarding telling me the flight was full and a group of passengers were to fly on the next day's flight, on a ticket and prepaid seat they were fully paid for in advance.  I had to spend the night in Paris airport hotel and wait for the next day's flight to Yerevan.  Air France without notice to it's passengers' to increase their profit margins had decided to fly a smaller plane to Yerevan on July 25th, without having concern for leaving their passengers and their luggage behind.  Air France supervisor finally after all their passengers had boarded showed up without apology threatening the furious passengers with police.  Fortunately the French police was more civil than Air France supervisor, they stayed out of Air France dirty laundry and left them to sort the mess.  Finally when some of the passengers were given seats their carry on luggage was checked in and the checked in luggage left behind.  Without compensations a claim was filed on their site but the site did not allow for a delivery address.  Two days later AF called telling me I had to pick up my luggage at the airport when I had included a primary residence address on the claim.   Apparently I had not provided a local phone number and my international cell phone number was not acceptable for a local delivery.  When contacted the Local Yerevan Air France office the sales desk agent Anna Baghdasaryan was just as loud and rude as the supervisor in Paris.  Not once they showed remorse for their lack of professionalism or showed customer service.   I presume Air France agents are trained in finding obstacles instead of solutions, Have no concern the stress and health risk they pause to the passengers with their irresponsible behavior, pass the buck and scream loud to silence the exhausted passengers instead of listening.  The ordeal is exhausting and Air France conduct and lack of customer service unacceptable.  Their customer service is a health threat.",2023-07,2023-07-27,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0

OLD Girl needs a NEW dress,New York City,Paris,International,"Been flying Air France for more than 25 years. Lucky enough to fly business. This was a rewards ticket for only 226k for 2 round trips. Booked in April for a June flight.
Flight was overbooked and we felt pressured to give up our seats. There was a ""veiled"" ""threat"" that  the airline might force someone to give up their seat.
Didn't feel comfortable with that. They mentioned ""compensation"" but NOT a specific minimum. If we hadn't flown from South Florida we might have considered it.
Anyway, boarding was fine but not real organized at the gate. NO one was there upon arrival and check in for Sky Priority as they had in the recent past.
The Plane......Can we say it was like a worn house dress?
It smelled musty, there was a black smoky like film on the ceiling, damage to the seat frame that was clearly hand painted over, the sided of the seat frame in front of me was coming apart. In fact the guy's seat in front of me didn't recline. The staff made at least 2 attempts to fix it to no avail.
Service
Was rushed! One of the male attendants was clearly impatient and showed it in his face when, asked a question twice because I couldn't hear him. I speak French fluently. Did not feel comfortable asking..POLITELY for anything.
Food
Hmmmmm not the best. Risotto was OVER DONE, didn't have much taste. the foie gras was almost frozen. 
There was no ""mattress"" for our seats to use for sleep as we had enjoyed before
In closing the flight was lack luster as compared to other flights in same class on Air France.

Luggage
We waited a long time after most passengers had theirs already.",2023-06,2023-07-22,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0
Air France business special treat: we loose your luggage but no compensation,Paris,Singapore,International,"Flew actually from GVA to CDG, then to SIN. 
The old AF business class seat was dated, but still all right. Service on board was fine (if you speak French on AF, it is in general the case, but only if you speak French), and food, all right. But arriving without luggage while time at CDG was ample, was really annoying. No help was provided by the ground staff. So I had to go to shop for basic essential goods and ask then for reimbursement. That was refused by Air France on the ground I was 1/2 day late!
Since I was travelling, I did indeed submit my expenses 21 1/2 days later. Air France argued that according to the Montreal convention, I was late. Of course, there were no warning whatsoever on any document about that delay. 
Given the fact, Air France also lost my luggage on the way back, I would have expected the airline to better treat business class customers. Unacceptable. And stupid, as I'll certainly won't fly long haul with them any more since they are not capable to handle luggage properly.",2023-03,2023-07-21,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0
Big Disruption on Air France flight: a 5-hour delay became much longer,Singapore,Paris,International,"Air France flight AF181 from SIN to CDG on May 30th, 2023,
specific details:
- original STD (Scheduled Time of Departure): 8:00 AM 
(6 hours before the flight, the airline informs of a Disruption via the app - see screenshot)
 - Doors Closed at: 14:43,
- Pushback at: 14:52
- Take-off: 15:12
 
Flight duration: 12hrs45min 

Super Long Delay: initially what was supposed to be a 5-hour delay due to technical issue became much longer. 
The Additional delay was only announced after Boarding was complete, the pilots said it was due to need for extra fuel??  Seriously?! How unprofessional!
 The Fuel (or Weight?) problem resulted into a Very long connection time of 11h50min!

-- Missing amenities kit: I noticed that every other passenger was given a kit of toothbrush and earplugs, but there was no such kit in my seat.. And I'm a Silver member.ü•à

The only good thing was the lunch box that passengers were given at CDG airport. However, that was the least that the airline could do. They did not even bother to inform passengers that a hotel accommodation would be provided. 
Overall, the negative aspects prevailed and I'm very disappointed with Air France. I would Not recommend Air France to any of my friends.",2023-05,2023-07-20,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0
"AirFrance does not deserve to be an airline. Racist, useless, and lazy staff.",Paris,Edinburgh,Europe,"We were from Thailand and the airport security was really bad. They had us wait 20 minutes while looking at a bag of our chocolates and laughing with eachother, and I heard the word ‚ÄúAsian‚Äù. Bad enough.

Then our bags got offloaded after we slept in the airport and got to edinburgh, and we had to buy new clothes everyday, new bags, and everything else. And most of our bags were gone. It took then weeks to have us go ALL THE WAY BACK to edinburgh just to get rejected. Waste of money and time. A week later, we finally got our stuff, and had to just send it back in thailand. We never used it. DO NOT use Airfrance, their security is slow, doesn‚Äôt care if we miss our flight or not, and the worst, they said ‚ÄúAsian‚Äù and I don‚Äôt want to say the word, but you know.

Wanted to book flights on a particular date.

Business Class but $35 for WiFi and Service akin to Coach,Paris,Los Angeles,International,"Compared to Lufthansa, Delta and Virgin there is zero reason to choose this airline.

The service is no better than coach, the food ""selections"" are not really selections at all and they starve you compared to other Business Class services (I'm not a big person or a big eater but even for me this is ridiculous for a ten hour flight).

Oh, and if you are expecting a ""schwag bag"" with essentials and something with keeping... don't.  On Lufthansa, which costs the same and  is not in upper class carrier like Emirates even, you'll get sleeping clothes and slippers.

"Incompetent,  Traumatising, and Inhumane Customers Service",Paris,Milan,Europe,"""It was a connecting flight from Helsinki to Milan, and I was pretty sure everything would go smoothly. My daughter and I landed in Terminal 2F. Each of us had a cabin-sized suitcase and a handbag weighing around 18 kilos each. An Air France check-in attendant at Vantaa Airport in Helsinki confirmed that it was alright for us to have them onboard. We passed through the security check and arrived at CDG on time.

However, when we reached the entrance to the gate, it turned out that we had to go through the security check again (!) and our cabin luggage was overweight, exceeding the limit of 12 kilos. The staff member at the entrance to the security check sent me to Section 5 of the Air France Customer Service to resolve the issue. My daughter stayed behind to wait for me at the security entrance.

What I encountered there was a display of incompetence and a total unwillingness to help from the so-called Customer Service. To be honest, any chatbot would have been more human and compassionate than the entire shift of that unsupportive and careless customer care team, which consisted of about 5 people in total.

First, they said I had to pay for extra luggage. Initially, I tried to argue that it was a connected flight within the same company. Then I agreed to pay, but they said the flight was closing. I asked them to provide me with the bill so I could pay through my Air France account immediately. However, the customer manager changed her mind while we were speaking. She said the only way to board the flight was to get rid of 5 kilos of luggage.

I rushed back to the security check, only to find out that they had allowed my 15-year-old daughter to pass through the security check with the same cabin luggage that was now considered overweight.

At that point, I started to feel very anxious. The staff member at the security check told me to go back to the customer management team. They asked for my passport, which was in my daughter's bag. I only had my boarding pass and showed them my Italian Residence Permit.

All my arguments, including the fact that I needed their help to retrieve my passport from my daughter after the security line where only they had access, and that it was their Air France double standard policy regarding luggage, fell on deaf ears. Two younger ground service attendants were looking as if they were watching a TV show episode, while the managers sneered at me, saying, 'What flight, madam? It's closed.'

Eventually, the flight was delayed for 90 minutes. I was about to throw away some of my textbooks (I'm a professor at Unimi), cosmetics, and shoes, but a beggar at CDG airport stopped me and said it was good stuff, so he should keep it. He took the items and walked away, considering it his lucky day.

Air France could have allowed checked baggage, and they could have provided assistance to both me and my daughter, who was trying to get help from the ground services near the gate. However, none of that happened, despite it being Air France's fault, and the Customer Support team didn't lift a finger to assist the passengers.

After reading other reviews here on TripAdvisor blaming Air France for incompetence, unprofessionalism, and even racism, I found them quite helpful, as I know from my traumatizing experience that such reviews are not unfounded.""",2023-07,2023-07-11,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

My return flight was cancelled and the alternative was departing a day in advance therefore wasting a day of the trip in the unatractive Bucharest airport, having to pay for meals and overnight accommodation. Air France refused to reimburse. Their Flying Blue program is also rather poor. All you get at Platinum level is access to the AF lounge which is now very crowded, if a little less so than the airport itself. Never free upgrades or an upgrades system like in the US.

Terrible experience with Air France.,Ottawa,Florence,International,"We were a group of 4 and purchased our airfares 4 months before our trip.  The day before our departure, we were unable to get our boarding passes online.  The agent could not help on the phone either. When we arrived in Montreal, Air France staffs could only assigned seats to us for the first leg of our journey, from Montreal to Paris.  She put us on STANDBY for the second leg which is from Paris to Florence, Italy.  When we arrived at the gate in Paris, the staffs told us right a way that the plane was full and we have to wait for the next flight which is 10 hours later.  We told them that we had purchased our tickets 4 months before and should not be on a STANDBY position.  There were a few passengers waiting for the seats.  If we had not stood our ground, the staffs would have given our seats to other standby passengers.  On our return flight home two weeks later, we were able to check in online the day before, but could not get boarding passes.  When we arrived at the Rome, Italy airport, there were long lineups at Air France counters for check ins.  No Kiosks.  The plane was delayed for almost an hour.  We missed our connecting flight from Paris to Montreal.  While rebooking our next flight which was 4 hours later, only two of us received assigned seats.  The other two were on STANDBY again.  The two without seats were instructed to get our seats at the gate counter.   My husband had to stand and wait for more than half an hour at the gate counter before we got our seats.  Thet fact the plane was not 100% full is mind boggling, why they waste their time and the passengers' and not assigned seats to all 4 of us in the first place. I can understand if someone purchases a ticket at last minute and the plane is full, a standby option is appropriate.  But we purchased our tickets many months before, it is fair that we should have the priority.  The way Air France conducts its business is not a sound one.  Air France ruins our perfect holiday.  We'll never fly with Air France again.  Final notes:  We lost 3 of our 4 luggages and they arrived 3 days later.",2023-06,2023-07-01,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0

AIR FRANCE HEIST,Paris,Vancouver,International,"If there is one word to describe Air France and its staff --- it is Obnoxious THIEVES! Air France will force you to pay to check in your hand carry!  Even as a couple you can only bring 12 kgs of hand carry! And they even include the weight of your handbags! For real! 

At the end of the day, this is simply a ploy by Air France to gain additional revenue. They leave you  on your own to print and put on your luggage tag on your check in baggages-- with no assistance from air france staff. Later on, they will stop you at security and force you to pay and check in your hand carry for being over weight - so they say. Since your check in luggages is already gone, you do not have the option to transfer some items. Now you are forced to pay for an additional chcek in luggage. 

The counter to check in your hand carry has a long line - manned by very few Air france employees. When we asked one of the supervisors if they could add personnel as we were running late, she Snootily and obnoxiously  told us to wait.  Hate this Airport! Hate this Arilines and its staff!

Air France is not ‚ÄúBon‚Äù Voyage.,Nice,New York City,International,"Air France is a terrible experience. If you‚Äôre thinking of booking with them‚Ä¶ DON‚ÄôT!  

The business class section is one of the most uncomfortably designed cabins and is very worn, a bit dirty (crumbs and paper in one of the storage areas) and old.

The smaller piece that was checked in with the large one arrived‚Ä¶ but no information whatsoever about the missing item.

The fact that one is kept in the dark about personal property shows the lack of customer care. Over 3 hours spent on the phone for naught.

That,  my friends,! is to be enough to keep you from fretting about all your property that is missing.

You couldn‚Äôt pay me to fly this airline again.,Paris,Seattle,International,"Terrible airline. Absolute mess trying to check in for flight as they seem to have no ability to understand that some people have green cards. The worst staff are in the airport. They just send you on a wild goose chase to get your bags checked, which is basically like a massive crowd hangin around a few self bag check things and then 1-2 people trying to manage all the chaos of people who can‚Äôt check themselves (like me), or have cancelled flights (seemed quite common based on the people I met on the plane). Then when you go through security they send the Brits and Americans down a separate line and some little man pulls out all the women and makes them weigh their bags and then go and pay ‚Ç¨85 euros to check a bag if you‚Äôre even 1lb over. And by this I mean the exact same bags you can get through the airport security at seattle where there‚Äôs no little man from
Air France whose power has gone to his head that‚Äôs just basically trying to scam people into giving the airline extra money. They have no problem letting 300lb passengers through, but a 160lb passenger with  bags that weigh 1lb too much are doomed. That‚Äôs if you‚Äôre female though. There were plenty of men let through with a ton of heavy hand luggage. So basically, if you are a woman, don‚Äôt fly Air France.

High fares. Good crew and bathrooms; bad meal and communication.,Paris,Washington DC,International,"This was the second booking after the original return flight had been cancelled, rebooked, and cancelled again for no specific reason other than ‚Äúoperational difficulties,‚Äù with only two 15-euro meal vouchers as compensation (we are appealing online). The one good outcome was that we were rebooked on a newer plane, an Airbus 350, than the original Boeing 777 that took us to France, but a far cry from the Dreamliner that used to fly this route before the pandemic.  The crew was cheerful and efficient, the bathrooms were spectacular for economy (clean, surprisingly spacious, well-equipped, good lighting), and the entertainment options were very good although our flight trajectory program did not work. As expected, the economy seats were uncomfortably narrow, and the aisle was so narrow that two people of normal height and weight could not pass each other without smashing into something (another person or seat). On the unexpectedly bad side was the food and the Air France communications regarding our flight.  The main meal pasta option was profoundly insipid: ratatouille over couscous.  Now, that might sound good, but it wasn‚Äôt. The couscous lacked its usual nutty flavor, and it was topped with about one teaspoon of tasteless ratatouille.  It is hard to make ratatouille that insipid, but Air France managed to do so, and the miniscule quantity of sauce did not add much to the flavorless couscous.  The unassuming snack of a crudit√© sandwich, while not spectacular, was much better than the main meal.  Then there was the communication, or lack thereof.  When Air France cancelled the original flight back, at least we were notified by text just before we left for the airport.  However, the text offering us early check-in came after we had already checked in.  And we got another text offering us free wi-fi on board, only after the flight.  From the double-cancellation to late notifications, the organization of Air France‚Äôs communication is messy.

A comedy of errors,Dallas,Paris,International,"Our trip through Paris to Portugal had so many problems, it's hard to know where to start.  The plane was a 787 Dreamliner.  We were in coach, a couple of rows behind the premium coach seats.  Surprisingly, there were no overhead ventilation nozzles.  None.  So we couldn't control the airflow to our seats.  And that became very important because there was NO air conditioning in our cabin.  We roasted (it was worse because we were on the ""sunny"" side of the plane...more on this later) and had no way to try to cool down.  It was too hot to even attempt to sleep.  Add to that that the seat in front of me was broken.  The guy in it kept leaning it all the way back (I don't think intentionally) so the screen and the back of the headrest was a mere 6 inches from my face unpredictably.  Because it's the Dreamliner, it does not have manual window shades to pull down, but rather the windows that darken.  Well, they had those disabled for a good portion of the flight, so we could never shut out the sun. So...harder to sleep yet again.  And, once we finally got on the ground at CDG, we sat there for quite some time for no ostensible reason (at least none that was given to us).  We dashed across the rat's maze that is CDG and just barely made our connection.  Of course...our bags did not.  Those didn't show up until the middle of the next day.  All in all, a very frustrating trip.

Disappointing Experience: Air France's Business Class and Last-Minute Flight Cancellation,Tbilisi,Paris,Europe,"We made a reservation for two business class tickets with Air France for a round trip from Tbilisi to Paris (departing on 12 June 2023), continuing from Paris to Geneva (on 17 June 2023), and finally returning from Geneva to Paris and then Paris to Tbilisi (on 23 June 2023). However, we were thoroughly disappointed and taken aback when we boarded our flight from Tbilisi to Paris and discovered that the quality of the business class seats was noticeably inferior compared to certain low-cost airlines. Adding to our disappointment, there was no entertainment system available, and the seats offered a meager 5-degree recline despite the flight's duration of nearly 5 hours.

In addition, to exacerbate our frustrations, our scheduled flight from Geneva to Paris (Air France AF 1843) and subsequently from Paris to Tbilisi (AF 3030) at 12:00 pm on 23 June 2023 was canceled on the very same morning, without any prior notice. This unexpected cancellation had a significant impact on our entire travel itinerary.

Upon being notified of the cancellation, we were rebooked on an exceptionally inconvenient alternative itinerary, which we find entirely unacceptable. The new itinerary required us to travel from Geneva to Paris, then to Amsterdam, and finally to Tbilisi. Departure from Geneva was rescheduled to 9:45 pm on 23.06.2023, resulting in a prolonged connecting time of over 10 hours in Paris until the next day for the Paris-Amsterdam leg, which departs at 8:40 am on 24.06.2023. Furthermore, we were allotted a mere 40 minutes of connecting time in Amsterdam, adding further inconvenience and potential stress to our journey.

To seek resolution for the disrupted travel plans, we promptly approached the Air France ticket counter at the airport. Unfortunately, we encountered a lone attendant who informed us of her imminent closure and assured us that someone else would be available to assist shortly. Regrettably, despite waiting for approximately 45 minutes, no further staff members arrived. The check-in staff themselves were astonished by the situation but expressed their inability to provide assistance as they were subcontracted employees from another company. In disbelief, we even took a picture of the deserted ticket counter as proof of the bizarre situation. It was a stark reminder of the uncertainties and unexpected challenges that can arise during travel.

Because of the flight disruption and the lack of customer support and viable alternatives presented by Air France, we were compelled to book a full-fare flight with another airline to ensure our timely return home. This unexpected expense, coupled with the emotional strain of the entire ordeal, has caused considerable inconvenience and distress.

This was our first experience flying with Air France on this particular itinerary, and based on this experience, we will not take the risk again.",2023-06,2023-06-25,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0
Horrible time keeping and customer service,Vienna,Johannesburg,International,"Air France's time keeping and customer service just keeps getting worse.  None of the 4 flights on our recent holiday trip was on time.   Our flight from Vienna to Paris was delayed for more than 2 hours, causing us to miss our connecting flight. If only they could place an information board where you exit, to inform you immediately that you missed the flight, with steps on how to proceed, it would make things easier.  Instead, the pilot tells everyone that you should go check and see if perhaps your connecting flight is also delayed. What nonsense. Then, if it it the middle of the night, as happened with us, allo the customer service kiosks are closed, except one. You have to trudge across that vast airport (CDG) and ask cleaners etc where the CS kiosk is. As it happens, you have to leave the secure area to get to it.  There, everybody who missed their AF flights are queueing to be re-routed, with one or two AF agents to help. It is a complete disaster, people were ready to grab each other by the throat with everyone so tired from flying, running around the airport in the middle of the night  looking for the CS desk, and people jumping the queue, and AF's agents didn't seem to have any empathy with the customers predicament. Next, they told us that the airport hotel is fully booked, and we could go to ""K21"" to sleep. They gave us each a bottle of water, a comfort pack with T-shirt, toothbrush etc and sent us on our way. What they did NOT say is that to get to K21, we had to go bachk through security.  There, we were litereally chased away like dogs, by a person that could not or would not tell us why in English. We went back to the customer desk, where they said they knew their job and we must go to this K21. Only when challenged, one of them walked with us to the security. The rude little man there said we could not go through with the water that the AF desk gave us. To someone else he said they have shut down the machines for the night. All this while the customer service desk keeps sending people to him! Finally we were allowed to go through, but not before the security people rudely pawed through our suitcases (we were scanned in Vienna before flying to Paris, so this was completely unneccessary.) And what did we find at K21? A bunch of plastic and aluminum stretchers on the floor!!  No blankets or pillows.  Sleeping facility my....  Really a horrible experience.

Wonderful in the air but very inconvenient itinerary changes before flying,Edinburgh,Newark,International,"Flights were Edinburgh to Paris, Paris to Newark airport on a Boeing 777-200.  Both flights were on time and arrived early.  Service was impeccable in the business class cabins.  Cabin crew were welcoming and attentive.  We appreciated that on the Paris to Newark segment we were personally greeted by the chief purser as top tier frequent flying members of Flying Blue.  The food served was amazing, very tasty.  Would happily fly with Air France again. The reason I haven't given an excellent rating is that both our flights were changed prior to the trip and we ended up flying a day earlier than we had originally booked to avoid a 10 hour layover in Paris.",2023-06,2023-06-22,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0
Uncomfortable,Birmingham,Havana,International,"First time flying with this airline, downloaded the app joined the explorer club
was looking forward to flying.
i had to fly to CDG Paris then connect for Havana.
Birmingham to CDG pleasant but the 10 hour flight to Havana not so.
Boarding was a shambles, late leaving with no explanation other than some passengers were late boarding so i assume flight missed spot.
Return flight was terrible, i chose my seat and paid extra beforehand, Someone sat in seat in front of me and reclined which ok they are entitled to do so, but it left me with very little room and the tv screen was far too close for me to watch, i am only small build so for me to complain of no room is unusual.
When i mentioned this to cabin crew member she was very dismissive and rude, 
she actually knew the passenger. 
For a 10 hour flight it was unbearable the seat was also uncomfortable.
I wasnt asked if i wanted a drink when she was serving, i had to call her back.Breakfast was a hard bread roll,most crumbled when i tried to break it open and a yogurt,
I could not wait to get off.

It's the end of my 10 day vacation and I still don't have my luggage.  I told them to leave it in Paris and on my last day it may be in Cairo or it's in Paris.

I thought it was going to be the easiest since it wasn‚Äôt a cheap airline. People were frantically running back and forth moving things around to be weight compliant. It is a horrible thing for a traveller to get used to a standard of baggage and then run into an absolute scam of an airline. 100euros to check a bag if you do not meet weight. So 200 euros for my wife and I if we did not wear 3 layers of clothing. Disgusting and symmetrical to our experience of Paris as well.

Worst customer service and lack of professionalism,Paris,Singapore,International,"We got a 2 way ticket from Air France for our trip to Paris from SG for a holiday trip. From SG to Paris, it was smooth however from Paris to SG was shockingly awful. 

1. It seems like not all staffs are aware of SOPs or dealing with issues at a professional level. We had a transfer from Palma and arrive in CDG Paris at 930am and we enquire in person at the counter if we are able to check in our luggage early despite our flight back to SG being a 850pm flight. First they say yes we can check in the luggage, asked us to head to counter 4 to do it then after which another person at counter 4 said to go counter 10, then went to counter 10, another person said counter 4. Like what? Eventually talk to the agent at counter 4 and she let us through because it was doable to drop off the luggages early, so we walk through the queue to the counter drop off and got stopped by 2 ladies whom check our boarding pass and said we had to go counter 10 because they don‚Äôt do drop off luggage this early, told them that their agent at the front said we can but insist we can‚Äôt and go to counter 10. Went to counter 10 again, and the agent told us it is indeed counter 4 and send a message through walkie talkie after giving our feedback on this chaos madness (she was really nice and helpful though so am really grateful for that) Went back to counter 4 eventually and told the 2 ladies they gave us wrong information. All they did was said sorry and just let us through. So are these people aware on what they should do especially when we are entrusting our luggages/belongings with them? 

2. We are aware of the lounge amenities available at a fee through the AF site and was interested as we had 10 hours to kill but was unable to purchase it online even through our account under ‚Äúmy bookings‚Äù as stated in their FAQ page on the lounge. Went to the lounge personally in hoping to get access into the area since the AF site said we could pay for the entry at the desk, we got denied and said it‚Äôs full when the area looks 30-40% full. We told the staff, we been trying to buy the access online as instructed through the AF site and they told us ‚Äúoh our website for that lounge payment/access is down, that‚Äôs why you were unable to do it‚Äù. We even ask if there is a waitlist system or what so ever and straight up said no. Soooo is it really available for purchase in the first place tho? Let me know if it‚Äôs a genuine IT glitch/down on the purchasing.

Excellent team work and many thanks to one particular helpful flight attendant!!!,Paris,New York City,International,"I was on board of flight AF0016 on June 12th 2023 from CDG to JFK. Prior to boarding, while I was waiting in line, I realized I lost my Apple Watch. I decided to quickly go back to the airport bathroom where I last remember seeing it. When I couldn‚Äôt find it, I came back to the waiting line. As I was boarding, I notified the 2 welcoming flight attendants that I lost my watch. One of them was Mrs Laurence Cavaillez. They both showed empathy and immediately notified the crew that was left in the boarding area about the incident, and indicated my name and the seat where I was located just in case. Shortly before take off, Mrs Cavaillez asked me if I used the Find My Watch app. I couldn‚Äôt believe that I forgot to use it. Clearly, I wasn‚Äôt thinking. She took upon herself to help me find my Apple Watch and we both sprinted back to the boarding area. We looked for a few seconds around where I was sitting. Nothing was there. The Find My Watch App all of a sudden showed that the watch was located i side the plane. We sprinted back inside the plane and I started to look for it while MrS Cavaillez made a public announcement using the speaker to notify all passengers that if they find my watch to notify one of the flight attendants. Shortly after, I found my watch that was deeply buried in my clothes. I felt horrible for stirring so much disturbance. I immediately notified the crew and everybody was happy and cheerful. No one made me feel bad. Quite the opposite. Mrs Cavaillez in particular and all of the crew members of Aifrance flight AF0016 were exceptionally accommodating and made me feel welcomed. Thank you so much to all of your kindness and support! You made my trip very pleasant the entire time from start to finish.

The representative then told us to move along. In addition, we were offered a 250 euro voucher for the delay, which they then downgraded to 150 euro.

The flights were ALWAYS 1-3 hours late, the worst was from Paris to Cancun when before the 10 hours flight  they made us board then wait in the plane for 2 extra hours without any clear reason. The food was also horrible, worst I ever had on a long distance flight. They are also scammers‚Ä¶ In their app on the boeing 777 they say that the duo seats are NOT next to each other and that the middle seat is not there. I almost bought it (around 50 eur plus) but luckily did some research and realized that it is actually just 2 seats next to each other (not 3) - and it‚Äôs the most expensive in economy. So you can avoid sitting in a row of 3 this way but keep in mind there are 2 seats next to each other there (no space in between). 
This was also the only flight which tried to make me to check in my carry on, it was obviosly essential for me to have it with me due to the huge amount of lost bags they have + short transfer times. Anyway, pro tip: most people just accepted it and then took off the sticker from their carry on in the corridor before entering the plane so they could take it. 
So yeah it was cheap long distance but short distance it is not, it is just horrible.",2023-06,2023-06-12,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0
Not a business class experience.,Mumbai,Boston,International,"Out of Mumbai, I paid for an upgrade from premium economy to business class. The business class was circa 1990s.  Wow, I haven't seen such old business class seats in a very long time, especially on long haul flights.  I have flown business class on other international flights and haven't seen a business class this run down.  When they offer such business class seats, they should not be charging any extra money for the seats.
The service was just as poor.  Nothing special.  Very limited menu especially for a vegetarian. They do not even provide linens to sleep on like other airlines.
This was my first time on Air France and very disappointing.

When I booked my flight on airfrance.com I paid extra to choose my seat and selected a seat at extra charge. At the airport, Delta informed me that the seat is no longer available and I could not select a seat on their flight last minute. Apparently Air France contracted this flight with Delta without informing the passengers.

Lovely AF experience,Paris,Atlanta,International,"We would like to share our beautiful AF experience.
We did fly on May 25th from Paris to Atlanta with AF on flight AF0688.
We had reserved duo seats on the first raw by the exit and got extra charged for it.
AF did last minute replace the Airbus 350 by an old Boeing 777. We found this out arriving at the airport. We couldn‚Äôt get the duo seats on the first raw with extra legroom as reserved, and there was no one from AF able to help at the airport.
We filed a complain after the flight and asked to be credited for the extra charge as there was no zone with extra legroom on board of this aircraft. AF answered that our seats were in the zone with extra leg room and denied to credit us for the extra charge.
We didn‚Äôt get the seats we reserved and paid for, but AF offered us extra tape on our seats as you will see on the pictures attached. Our seats were not the only one taped and some seats were broken.
To top it of our luggage was not loaded in Paris and it took 5 days to receive it.
It‚Äôs a shame to see that AF customer service is inexistant, and to fly on board of aircraft‚Äôs that you would expect to find in third world countries.

"Good flights, but for my original return flight I was denied boarding",Prague,Saint-Denis,International,"Nice short flight on a new Airbus 220 from Prague to Paris CDG. The seat comfy, with clever gadgets such as mobile phone holder, USB charger etc. The crew amicable and efficient. A small chicken or veggie sandwich provided together with cold and hot beverages. 

The second leg from CDG to Reunion was quite good, the food tasty but the portions get over years smaller and smaller. But AF still offers glass of champagne as aperitif or digestive with coffee. Drinks at the rear galley with some small snacks between the meals as self service.Friendly and relaxed crew. It was overnight flight and the crew  let us sleep till the  last hour  before landing when they swiftly served cold breakfast which was nothing to write about.

Do not use AF Whats-app as it is waste of time, they replied after 3 days with just generic message. I asked for compensation.

Another flight (return to Helsinki) was flyed by Airbus A220 type, interesting new version. We liked it's seat arrangements (2+3 at rows)>, we booked 2 seats beside.

Simply didn't care less about us,Paris,Toronto,International,"We were delayed for 2 hours while sitting on runway. When we landed, there was no directions to find our connection flight as to make things easier for travelers. Despite we booked our travel through Costco, supposedly with ample time for connection, we still missed our flight. Apparently Delta was not informed of the delay and was surprised to see us. We were sent back to Air France. While we wait in the long line of people checking in, my husband spotted a side counter suddenly was manned, so I went over there with my booking information. I was ignored for like 15 minutes. Eventually the guy simply said ""my colleague will help you"" and walked away. When she came over, not immediately, she brought patrons with her.

From bad to poor,Tel Aviv,Paris,International,"Another delayed AF flight  - delayed by 1,5 hrs both departure at TLV and arrival in CDG. Fortunately I took it in account, and hat booked an airport hotel at CDG, continuing the journey next morning, instead of the same evening.
Food quality was slightly better than at the onwards flight, but still ruined by wooden cutlery. This time I moved from my extra legroom seat to the empty window seat one row behind, not only for the better views out of the window, but also for having a tray table in front of me to fold down for better support of arms and of own electronic devices. 
After an otherwise uneventful flight, and continuation of the journey home to DUS, also on AF, I had to realize that the baggage handlers had mishandled and completely destroyed my Rimowa suitcase - cracks on every corner, and one of the 4 wheels almost broken out of its bed. Total damage due to mishandling. It looked like the suitcase was thrown forcefully from height or over a distance.
I claimed justifyed compo from AF for the damage, and added a detailed statement from Rimowa customer service, but it happend: Nothing over a period of several month. After I sharply insisted, after another couple of weeks, meanwhile Oct/Nov 2022, I received out of the blue a phone call from AF, and we agreed to a compensation sum, but again nothing happened. After another complaint, several weeks later I received another call from a different AFagent, opening the news they would have re-thought the case, and would void the former agreement, but lower the compensation sum!? At this point I was just fed up with AirFrance, that I decided to safe the energy and not to go to the court, but just get rid of AF/KLM in the future. despite Gold status I cancelled my FlyingBlue account for good,. AF would just see me one more time on a flight to Costa Rica, after Christmas, where AF served the first and last leg between DUS and CDG, and which I couldn't cancel. But it's over now. I forget about AirFrance and KLM in the future from now.",2022-06,2023-05-31,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0
"Then end of the world is near, when ...",D√ºsseldorf,Tel Aviv,International,"Flown this route at least once or twice a year with AF from DUS to TLV via Paris CDG  for years now, usually in Business Class. But since their pricing scheme went rediculously sky rocketing in 2022, I took advantage from my Skyteam Gold status, with lounge access and better cabin bag allowance even in Economy Class. Check-In and bag drop in DUS took half an hour queueing in the Priority line (only one AF/KLM Prio counter was open, not sufficient to serve all the queueing Prio Pax).
After boarding in DUS we could only take off after a 40 min delay, and arrived CDG Terminal 2G with a +50 delay, which made it almost impossible to reach the connecting flight from Terminal 2E, which required a bus transfer and looong walks between 2G and 2E. (Those who know CDG, know what I'm talking about). Not walking but running almost the entire trail, while shlepping my 2 cabin bags, I made it the very last minute to the departure gate before gate close.
After I made myself as comfortable as possible in the seat with extended leg room next to the doors, which I splurged having extra paid for.  To be honest, I would not pay for it again. The legroom was very good, but... Not only was the ""window"" seat missing a window to look out, instead of the massive cabin door. There was also no appropriate storage space for this seat. One had to overhead locker it during start and landing, and during the flight just to put it on the carpet in front of you. :-(

AF catering was always a pleasure - not so anymore. Not only that the inflight meal was just barely edible. AF ruined even this by the crazy idea to provide wooden ! cutlery with the meal, but from the poorest of poorest quality! Meeh! Not polished but with a rough surface haptic like a log of wood. The spoon and fork would not slip in and out the mouth, and at the same time you receive a mouthful of wooden taste, instead of a taste of food. I'm not exaggerating. I can't remember that I ever had such a poor catering in the recent 10 yrs. And this from a FRENCH ! Airline. What a shame! Red wine was served from little green plastic! bottles, to poor into plastic cups.  - To be fair,  kudos to the crew who were friendly and tried to make the best out of this awkward situation.

To complete their failure: Of course, my luggage didn't made it at CDG onto the connecting flight to Tel Aviv. So I was from Friday afternoon with only the clothes I had on myself, until I finally after a lot of trouble got delivered  3,5 days later on Monday evening , on my last day in Jerusalem before moving on. There is more money and time damage to this story, and also other flights before on AF/KLM but it's not worth to report it here.

Buttom line: One more failure like that, and AF/KLM will see me from behind in the future.",2022-06,2023-05-31,2.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0

Horrible all around‚Ä¶,New York City,Casablanca,International,"We booked two business class tickets from NY to Casablanca, flying through Paris. In October 2022 for travel in May 2023. The tickets cost @$8,000.  In April, AF notified us that the plane for the  flight from Casablanca to Paris had been changed and they could no longer give us a business class ticket.  Although they allowed that we could change our flights, we had a connection and could not extend our trip.  So we flew economy.  Although the difference in the actual cost of the tickets was @$800 AF gave us a credit of $136. The food service on the Paris to NY flight was awful.  Serving an ice cold egg dish, with cold and hard bread and canned pears is not what one expects of Business Class service. The seats were uncomfortable and had barely been cleaned.  This is not the Air France of years ago. Notably, they didn‚Äôt send the usual customer survey request.  They must have known.

Pre booked seats not honoured . Treated like cattle on the bus from airport to aircraft,Paris,Birmingham,International,"As a family of 5 we paid to pre booked our seats but this was not honoured - refund process via WhatsApp impossible to navigate .
Airport waiting area for the passengers was not air conditioned , it was like a sauna . Unacceptable in such a big airport 
Bus  used to transfer us to the aircraft was unsafe, number of people on one coach was like cattle being forced into a lorry . The second bus only had 6 on it - appalling management of how we were treated. The check in staff allowed the bus driver to determine the number of people on the bus , he did not speak English so there was no option to speak to him about the aircon and number of passengers . He really did not give a dam , he clearly had not considered the safety of the passengers 
No aircon on the bus. Left in the bus at 23 degrees whilst the aircraft was made ready , ten driver stood outside in the shade whilst we were left crammed on his bus , why load us onto the bus  if the aircraft was not ready

"I paid to Fly to Dublin, they delivered me to Vienna and refused to refund me",Dubai,Dublin,International,"I booked a weekend trip to Dublin for a friends wedding -of which I was a member of the bridal party. 
I had booked a flight which connected in Paris, and would arrive in Dublin by 8am, as I had an afternoon dress fitting booked in with the bride. 
Unfortunately the flight was diverted due to a crew illness - which in itself was not an issue as the main concern was ensuring the person got the medical care that they needed. The problems started once we got to ground. 
We diverted to Vienna, and were sent to the terminal. Nobody could tell us where to go or what to do. All Air France staff disappeared, and we were shuffled through passport control. We then spent over an hour being sent from desk to desk , terminal to terminal and back again -nobody could tell us what was going on. I had already missed my connecting flight at this stage, and had no idea if or when I would be rebooked. 
Eventually an airport employee was able to send us to a gate where a different airport staff member had been allocated to coordinate for AF passengers. 
We were told that our flight would continue to Paris at 2pm (we landed at 6am) and that we would not be rebooked for connecting flights until we arrived in Paris. They could not even guarantee I would be rebooked for the same day - and they could not book us onto an earlier flight leaving Vienna, so that we could catch earlier connections. After looking online, I could see the only connecting flight I would be able to catch from Paris would be at 10pm that night - meaning I would not be able to fulfil my obligations to the wedding Party. This is the wedding of my oldest friend. I had left my baby for the first time, in order to travel to this wedding, so missing it was not an option! I was advised by the airport representative that since I was travelling only with carry on luggage, I could book myself a flight from Vienna to Dublin as I had time constraints, and that I would be reimbursed for the additional Flight, so that is what I did. I had to book a last minute flight for 250Euro, in order to reach Dublin on time for my commitments. Eventually - 3 hours after I landed in Dublin, I received a new ticket from air France with a rebooked flight that would add 2 additional stops to my journey and deliver me to Dublin at 11pm that night, 14 hours after my flight was scheduled to land -Not great when on a 3 day trip! 
When I emailed air France they were incredibly unhelpful. They claimed to pride themselves on customer service, but then went on to say that since they had no legal obligation to reimburse me for my out of pocket expenses that they would not refund me, for the flight that delivered me to the wrong country, or for the additional flight I had to purchase - despite being told that they would before I booked it. They have no concept of customer service. 
A legal obligation should not be the only reason that they will take care of their customers. It is not unreasonable to request reimbursement for a flight that did not take me where I paid to go. I paid for a service I did not receive, I was left out of pocket and they care only for legal obligations over customer satisfaction. 
They have since ignored all emails from me. It is impossible to speak to a human on the phone. 
I had flown previously with this airline, and had been really happy with everything, but this experience has lost them a loyal customer and made sure I will tell as many people that will listen about my experience. 
Air France - do better! Train your team about what customer service actually is. Simply meeting bare legal requirements and leaving your customers in the wrong destination is not how you do it.  Your customers deserve more than the bare minimum.",2023-04,2023-05-25,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

COMPLAINT ON FLIGHT CANCELLED BY AIR FRANCE WITHOUT ANY INTIMATION,Florence,Chennai (Madras),International,"For many years, My family and I have been loyal customers of Air France, and not once have we experienced such bad service and rude behaviour from the team. Even though there are many cheaper and faster alternatives, We still choose Air France for the quality of service and hospitality offered. However, the turn of events this time will make us rethink multiple times before choosing this airline ever again. 

I had booked a round trip from Florence(FLR) to Chennai(MAA) on the 13th of May, 2023. On making the payment (Money had been debited from my account) and finishing the booking I received the following mail from the company. Upon ensuring all the above, any customer would hope their job is done in securing a ticket for their travel. In order to check a few details I logged into my account again on the 20th of May, 2023 and to my surprise found out my tickets are no longer visible.

I immediately tried calling every helpline I could and Air France Germany was the first to help out. They mentioned that there was a delay in the payment reaching the company, but they have received the payment and only my tickets are yet to be issued. Hence asked me to call Air France Italy and request them to issue my tickets. I also called up Air France India to confirm the same. By now I had also checked with my bank and they mentioned that the payment has been debited from my account but the airline is yet to claim it. 

I finally got hold of Air France Italy through WhatsApp and a call, only to find out my tickets have been cancelled without any notice. The lady who spoke to me even had the audacity to say, ""Please book your tickets with another airline if you do not like our service, we can not book you any tickets, you must do it yourself and we also can not guarantee the same prices.""  I have never dealt with such rude and pointless customer service staff. The WhatsApp conversation went as follows and that too was not solving any problem. 

The following are my questions to you :
1. Why was I not informed immediately if my payment was not received by you?
2. Why was I not informed about my booking being cancelled? 
3. Do customers have to plead with airlines to issue their tickets every time? I have never ever come across such a system. 
4. Why are different Offices of yours giving different information to the customer? Are you scamming us? 
5. Why was there no assistance from your end to help book an alternative flight? 

I am a student who was hoping to go home for a few days before I start work. Now that my money is trapped and your flight rates have gone ever higher I will not be able to see my family. It is a shame to see airlines as big and loved as yours treat customers like this. It would be great to see more empathic assistance and apology from your company in the future. I do not know if I will ever get a reply, but we students know how to take this to higher authorities and hope that this mail can act as a way to document my horrible experience with Air France.  The travel industry is responsible for connecting people across the globe and must know that there is so much at stake for travellers, a lot more than you can see. The least you can do is treat your customers right. Shame!

Air France - Poor customer service - Go for KLM or another airline,Sofia,Bogota,International,"I had used up all my savings to buy my parents tickets to come see me in Colombia.  I got my tickets on Kayak with Air France and KLM, as it was the most affordable as well as conveniet flight on the net in January this year.

A month later Air France cancelled my original flights and I was forced to change flights as I had arranged other flights as per the Air France dates to take my parents around Colombia. 

My initial ticket had only one single layover,  and after that forced change, I ended up having a ticket with three layovers each way as Air France had cancelled my original flights, which were supposed to take only one stop once again. 

I am saying that I was forced to accept the change as I had no other money to spend on new tickets with another airline as I had already spent all my money on Air France and they take up to 60 work days to return your money. And it was impossible to miss the rest of my flights as I had bought them as per the Air France tickets which were bought first. 

Customer Service and management staff ignored my reasons and claims altogether. They would speak back rudely on the phone and at the airport in France.

We didn't have any boarding passes or whatsoever as the app wouldn't issue them. 

 There was no kiosk or a service desk to help us get a boarding pass so an airport member had to make an exception to let us in with the e-ticket and look for help. 

Partnerting airlines on our reservation were ITA and Tarom which were absolutely dirty and unpleasant. Tarom's plane felt like a tractor and filthy. 

The reservation says that meals are included and partnering airlines seem to skip or ignore that bit as we didn't get all meals that had been included. 

 They seem to be turning a blind eye on you. 95 per cent of customer service agents are grumpy and impolite. First and last time on Air France. Please, avoid it.",2023-05,2023-05-20,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"If you are a POC, consider a different airline.",Florence,Paris,Europe,"My family and I had a wonderful trip in Italy and had to catch an early flight via Airfrance to Paris and then catch our connecting flight back home to the U.S. I am a black woman traveling with my white boyfriend and my black younger brother. We were treated differently from every other passenger on the flight. The reception from the flight attendants was very cold and harsh. But worst of all was towards the end of the flight when the attendant SCREAMED (not an exaggeration, but indisputable fact) at my brother to turn his phone off before landing. He had fallen asleep on the ride with his phone in his lap and upon landing had missed the announcement to turn off his phone. Other passengers had made the same mistake and I watched the attendant politely ask passengers to power off their phones in a kind, even voice. But the moment the attendant noticed my brother's phone in his lap she actually SCREAMED at him to turn it off, multiple times. She continued to repeat herself at the same aggressive volume while jabbing her finger at the air towards him as he calmly complied without any protest. He even apologized about not hearing the announcement! She then asked him if he was even capable of turning off his phone thus insinuating that he wasn't smart enough to do so. My brother is very intelligent and very mild mannered. He was absolutely horrified/embarrassed about the interaction. She was so loud that it caused other passengers to turn in their seats to stare. The way she was screaming at him, you would think our row had committed a crime. It was incredibly belittling, utterly horrific, and beyond inappropriate. I will never fly with this airline again and I will advise all of my other friends/family/acquaintances to never ride with Airfrance or support this business. I'm not typically a person that will complain or write reviews, but I felt haunted after the experience because it was so ugly and so unreasonably aggressive. How disgusting.

"Problems encountered during my trip on flight AF655 on Friday, April 14th from Dubai to Pari",Dubai,Paris,International,"Due to the health issues of the captain (thankfully, I heard he's doing better now), we had to make an emergency landing in Vienna, where we were disembarked by bus at Terminal 3 around 4 a.m. Upon arriving at the terminal (there was no Air France representative to welcome us or keep us informed), an airport employee told us to go to the Air France counter at Terminal 1.

At the Air France counter, the hostess told us to go back to Terminal 3, where an Air France hostess would assist us. So we returned to Terminal 3 (after spending over an hour queuing at security) only to once again find no Air France representative.

I called Air France customer service multiple times, asking to be transferred to another flight (there were over 6 Vienna-Paris flights in the morning, including 3 Air France flights with available seats, as I checked on the internet). After being told that a seat was being reserved for me on the 10:05 a.m. flight, I was later informed that it was no longer possible but that I would be called back. However, I never received a call back, and despite my reminders, no solution or alternative was ever offered to me, nor was I kept informed.

I spent over 10 hours in Terminal 3 during which time I was never contacted or met with an Air France representative, and most importantly, I was never kept informed about the progress in resolving the issue (which prevented me from making alternative arrangements). Five days later, I received a generic letter from Air France with vague apologies, congratulating themselves for doing their best to resolve the problem and minimize its impact on passengers. It is a shame, and I recommend Emirates, which has a daytime flight, avoiding the need to spend a night on the plane, and, above all, treats its customers well.",2023-04,2023-05-17,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,4.0

Worst experience ever,Winnipeg,Bengaluru,International,"I had booked a flight from Winnipeg - Toronto - Paris - Bangalore on May 4th. Somehow I missed my connecting flight from Toronto. I ran to the Air France counter and there was no one. I asked a few friends of mine as well as I called Air France canada to check where my luggage was, and we were informed that the luggage was on the flight for final destination.

.There was no flight in the next few days and I had to get to india as there was a family emergency. So I ended up booking the next air India flight and got to Bangalore. When checked with the Air France staff in Bangalore, they did not have my luggage and denied to create a report as I was a no show on the flight and the luggage must have been off boarded in Toronto.

It has been a s**tshow since then. both Air France canada and Bangalore were not even taking the responsibility of the luggage, did not even raise a complaint even though I reached out them almost every day. Finally I was able to convince a friend of mine to go to the air port and talk to the Air France guys. He was allowed to go to the baggage arrival area and he found all four of my bags there. The Air France staff mentioned that they are not going to take the responsibility for the luggage and would probably be thrown somewhere in the lost and found. They offered him to take the luggage home if he wanted as the luggage was not safe there and they won‚Äôt care for securing it. The manager on duty mentioned that if their was a request raised, he could have helped until then he can‚Äôt do anything.

I escalated the issue though my travel agent company (Flight hub). I believe they pushed on the issue and Air France finally raised a report for me. Guess what, I called Air France to ask them if my friend can drop the luggage to the airport, it still has all the tags on. Previously the agent started to say that the duty manager had asked my friend to keep the luggage and once a ticket is raised we will see what can be done. Later once the ticket was raised, the agent on call says, it‚Äôs has already been 7 days, so we can not act on the request anymore. I was startled, I have been calling Air France canada and Bangalore location everyday to request for the last 1 week to raise an incident and they did not, they kept pushing me towards one another and the agent from Air France canada says that we had the ability to create a report for you, you must not have asked for it. I know it sounds ridiculous that I begged them to help me out to locate my luggage, stayed on calls with them 2-3 hours almost everyday and then they pin all on me at the end that I failed to ask to create a report. And now I have to post about $3000 to get my stuff couriered to me. It‚Äôs just so ridiculous.

Never with a dog in cabin!!!!  This company hates animals,Los Angeles,Paris,International,"If you want to take Air France with your pet, run! This company is inhuman to animals. Our little dog (miniature poodle) was on board with us, very calm and adorable on the flight LOS ANGELES - PARIS (AF 069 - departure 6:20 p.m.).

Right from the start, they attacked us when we boarded the plane with an unpleasant comment, but we didn't pay attention. We had taken the Duo seats so as not to disturb anyone. They still intentionally told us that opening the bag so the dog can breathe is forbidden (very aggressive tone again). Our dog was adorable and endured this treatment throughout the flight without making any noise for 11 hours. 

Two hours before landing, they turned on all the lights as if we were arriving when there were still 2 hours of flight! Of course our doggy started crying to get out and getting a little anxious in the bag. We then opened the bag slightly to pet him, comfort him and let him breathe - but still left him well in his bag -. The staff insulted us, threatened us, and even called the captain! These people are inhuman and don't care if your dog cries or is stressed or even chokes !!! They will tell you: it's not our problem, zip up the bag!!! On the other hand, to charge you a fortune for your dog on board, there is no problem.  No need to say that seeing our doggy so miserable for the last hour when he would still have been so calm if they had left us pet him (you cannot even pet your animal!), was torture. 

Apart from this persecution of people who travel with animals, the service is deplorable for all. No drink service for 12 hours. You don't see any attendants all flight. The food is inedible. They claim a menu choice, not at all. They serve you what they have and period. The seats are so uncomfortable and extremely tight, like in a low cost company. If you get the duo you hear the restroom flush all flight.  Restrooms are disgusting by the way.  

It's unacceptable for a ticket of 2200 euros per person and 200 dollars for your pet! My daughter then took the connection to Milan, and they made her put the dog down on the floor (forbidden to keep the bag on your lap!). This company is the enemy of animals and should be prosecuted for its inhumane behavior, including those in the hold where your animal can die.  Know that.  I tried that with my previous dog and they could not find our dog when we arrived in Roissy!!!  We had to wait an hour, and we got our cavalier back in a state of indescribable stress.  We thought ""never cargo again"" (but unfortunately, the cabin is not better).
I also heard horror stories from people who work for the company.  They specifically told me that it is not true that they check on dogs who are in cargo.  They say that to reassure the owners.  And that ""accidents"" happen.  So go luck if you want to try this route.

As to customer service, I specified that we were Gold Status as we travel a lot for work (the flight attendant said he ""doesn't care"") and that we will never travel again on Air France.  True:  They can't care less.  The french government always saves them from bankrupcy anyways.

Premium Economy is barely worth the premium,Toronto,Paris,International,"We've flown Air France Premium Economy a few times over the years, but my goodness, have standards ever slipped! OK, the check-in is fast with the Priority lineup. The problem is the aircraft and the food, which is what one pays for, especially in Premium Economy.
Air France has recently chosen to use Boeing 777-200's on the flights between Paris and Toronto. Here are the problems:
1. The seats do not recline! They kind of shift/articulate forward an inch or two, presumably to give one the impression of reclining, but they don't! And mine didn't ""shift"" at all! On a night flight to Europe, it is hard if not impossible to get comfortable and sleep.
2. The Premium Economy section is located right beside the massive engines that power the aircraft. The noise is deafening!
3. The food on the flight to Paris was almost inedible, both entr√©e choices. Imagine a child-sized package of Kraft Cracker Barrel cheese as your the accompaniment for a stale bread roll, or burned risotto.
For this we paid a premium? I hate to think what Economy was like!
I complained online to Air France and asked for compensation consideration. Of course, they said, ""No"". (""Non""). I was given 2 phone numbers for follow-up. One was an inoperative number in the US (I was in Paris), and the second was apparently in Kazakhstan judging by the country code. I asked for a French number so I could speak to a human.

Delightful trip,San Francisco,Paris,International,"SFO to Paris May 2nd 2023. 777 ER 300. 
It was a delightful trip. Tho I still love the old 380 they used to use with the double decker the entire length of the plane. 
Business in the 16th center row was very comfortable. Plenty of storage for all my carry on which is all I bring. The overhead bins are gigantic. You can over stuff any bag and put it on its side and still get it in there. 
The service and food were excellent. Yes excellent. The mostly male staff have a friendly attitude and know their job extremely well. Flight 083. The food was plentiful and tasty. 
The restrooms were alway kept clean and this is a rarity these days. I changed into a lounge suit and slept almost 6 hours. The cabin was quiet and dark after dinner and until about two hours before landing. It‚Äôs an 11 hour haul. It‚Äôs a quiet and spacious plane. Easy getting through passport control at CDG. We jumped a taxi and made it to St. Larare train station in time to get an earlier train to Bayeux / Normandy. We made the 1pm and landed at GDC at 10:40am. we had bought a flexible ticket on the non stop to Bayeux and it was easily changed to the earlier train by a young french man who works in the ticket office by the schedule board. We were scheduled for the 4pm 2.5 journey . We arrived in Bayeux by 3:15 which we truly appreciated after our long journey. We are staying at Hotel Tardif Noble in town.

The worst flight ever!,Paris,Accra,International,This was the only time in my life I felt the need to start yelling ‚Äúblack lives matter‚Äù on an airplane. I was on a flight from Paris to Ghana. The flight attendants were rude and disrespectful. They ignored my request for assistance by just shutting off the assistance notification button. The children in front of me were watching a cartoon produced by some French studio that was filled with racist imagery. This was a terrible experience. I was triggered for most of the flight. They spoke only in French and would not translate into English so you end up just not knowing what is going on for most of the flight. I will hopefully never have to use them again. Ugh!!!!

KLM/Air France defraud their customers,San Francisco,Warsaw,International,"We had our original return flights booked for November 2022 (we live in the US now). Our flights were cancelled. During our call with the call center we asked if we could also rebook the flights to April 2023 and add our newborn baby that had just arrived. We were told we can do that free of charge since our original flights were cancelled and we booked the flights during COVID special rebooking conditions. We received new schedule confirmation email (including flight details for our newborn girl) and were able to select out seats online. All that happened in October 2022. Fast forward to April 2023 when checking in we are prompted to call the hotline for check in. There we are told that we have to pay roughly $2k in rebooking charges and that we couldn't take the flights as booked since there was no space for the baby (despite her being on the confirmation from 2022). Since we had no other choice we had to pay up and rebook hotels and other flights we had booked on other airlines adding to the damage.

We were never told that there would be additional costs for rebooking (we explicitly asked and were told that everything, including adding the baby, was free). We never received any information about additional charges or an invoice. We only received new flight itinerary confirmations. If KLM/Air France would have informed us about additional costs we would have just opted to get a refund for the flights they cancelled and booked new flights ourselves.

Upon filing a claim with air France we are just receiving canned responses of regret but refusal to compensate out damages or refund the additional charges.

my experience was pretty bad,Tel Aviv,Mexico City,International,"On April 1, I traveled from Israel to Mexico by Air France. It was the worst decision I made since I was flying with my dog. (3kg mini toy poodle). Due to his weight and size, he travels with me in the cabin. The first 4 hours of flight to arrive in France was a very calm flight but the tragedy began on the flight from Franco Mexico, where the flight attendants told me since I entered the plane why I did not send my dog ‚Äã‚Äãfor luggage that my dog ‚Äã‚Äãwas bothering However, a few hours later in the flight, my dog ‚Äã‚Äãbecame very nervous and wanted him to take his head out of the bag to calm down, which was impossible because they would not let me, they even stayed by my side threatening me and that was the case during the 11-hour flight. There was one worker in particular who believed she had the right to yell at me, she even hit my arm in her madness. I took a photo of her and there were 2 hours left to get to Mexico and when she realized that I had taken a photo of her, she told me that I had to give her my cell phone. unlocked which did not happen and then I call the flight attendant who arrived 45 minutes before landing, it is worth noting that throughout the flight I asked to speak with him and he never came to my position. He only came to threaten me saying that if he didn't delete the photos he was going to send a report to have my dog ‚Äã‚Äãtaken from me and sent to quarantine as soon as I got off the plane. He asked me for my cell phone very insistently and when he saw my refusal, he began to yell until other passengers sided with me, telling him things until they went to the kitchen and there they continued yelling among themselves. It was the worst flight so far. I have not received an answer to my claim, which I made when I got off the plane. My dog ‚Äã‚Äãis 11 years old and has traveled to many places with the same number of flight hours and I have never experienced anything as disgusting and derogatory as on that disgusting airline I did not mention the food and entertainment during the flight and not to mention the state in which my beaten and broken suitcases arrived in which they also charged me a fortune for overweight. my flight number was AF975

Racist cabin crew,New Delhi,Lima,International,"We travelled AF0225 DEL-LIMA on 4th April 2023. This meant two long haul flights DEL-CDG and then CDG-LIMA. We expected the crew to be friendly and competent.

The crew on both the flights was visbly racist. They were very friendly to those from their own country, getting things for them from Business Class. For us, the snacks and teh dinner were interchanged: they gave us snacks at the time of dinner and dinner the next morning!

On CDG-LIMA flight the crew was friendlier. However, there was one member of the crew, a person of colour, who was very racist. He was serving ladies sitting next to us, stealinmg things from Business Class and serving them. To us, he was denying even a glass of water!

This was exceptional behaviour on a long haul flight. I have never faced such an experience before. So it was pretty unsettling.

This was definitely a changing moment for me and my fear, and will most likely make it easier for me to fly in the future. 

If you are like me, a nervous flyer, this is an airline that will take good care of you. They did this on both my flight to Paris and my flight home, which had different crew members. The experience was the same!

NEVER FLYING WITH AIR FRANCE EVER AGAIN,Johannesburg,London,International,"Worst flight ever. It started when we got on the plane in South Africa. They double-booked our seats, which we paid extra for because of the extra legroom. So, we had to move to different seats with standard legroom, and we were not given any compensation or reimbursement of any form. 
In addition, the staff of Air France were so rude. They were only nice to French people, so if you spoke English they just ignored you.
When it was time for food, they ran out of beef so there was only the vegetarian option left, and they didn't even try to sound apologetic. Also, I don't know what they put in the food but I experienced the most terrible heartburn for the better part of 2 hours. There was only one air hostess who was kind enough to get me some Gaviscon and a bottle of water. I had such a terrible sleep that night because of this.
We landed the next morning in Paris, as we had a 10-hour layover before our connecting flight to Heathrow. We were not allowed to leave the airport, so we were stuck there for the whole 10 hours, only to find that there was an earlier flight to Heathrow that they could have put us on, but they didn't because they didn't care about what was best for us, their customers.
In the airport in Paris, the staff only spoke French and did not want to help us. Our boarding passes did not say what gate we were supposed to go to, so we had to scan them at a machine to find out because no staff would help us. The machine told us gate K57, so that is where we went.
When our boarding time came, we were surprised to find that the flight crew was not at our gate yet. We waited 15 more minutes, and still no crew came. So, I asked a fellow passenger where this plane was flying to, and they tell me it's flying to Manchester. WE WERE TOLD THE WRONG GATE.
Our gate for the flight to Heathrow was K36. At this point, it was 15.45 and the gate was closing at 15.50. WE RAN. We got to the correct gate just in the nick of time, and when we get there, the staff try to make it seem like it was our fault for not checking which gate we were supposed to be at, when we were instructed to go to gate K57. There were no screens around showing our flight, and they said that we should keep checking with staff because the gates change all the time - how is that our fault?!
Eventually, we make it on the correct flight. But, when we boarded the plane, we found that our seats had been taken by other people. THEY MESSED UP OUR SEATS AGAIN. We ended up finding other seats ourselves because the air staff were no help. And we were not the only people who's seats were messed up - many passengers were in the wrong seats because of the airlines error.
We eventually got to Heathrow, but in a terrible mood because of our awful experience. This was such a disappointing end to the most wonderful holiday in South Africa. What made it worse was that we had such a wonderful flight with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines going to South Africa, so this experience with Air France was completely rubbish in comparison.
We are never flying with Air France ever again, and I would not recommend it to anyone at all.

The worst flight crew ever known,London,Freetown,International,"Judging by how high the percentage of poor reviews are for this airline, it‚Äôs clear that customer care is not high on their list of priorities. 
We travelled to Sierra Leone using Air France as it‚Äôs one of 2 airlines from the UK that currently fly out to Sierra Leone, therefore this appears automatically rule out any room for special treatment as there‚Äôs no competition. We flew premium economy for a bit of extra comfort and quite frankly, we may as well could have put the money we paid towards another holiday, because we received zero in terms of extra perks for flying premium economy.
At the start of our trip, the check in team at Heathrow airport were amazing, well organised and we thought this was the start of things to come. The flight from Heathrow to Paris was short, but the crew were polite and helpful. This all changed once we boarded the flight from Paris to Freetown. Drinks were rationed we were made to feel like we must not make choices, something which was promoted as part of the premium package. 
The worst was our return from Freetown to Paris - the air steward did not offer him the choice of meals they had available, but instead proceeded to tell him, he would have pasta. Thankfully, we had paid to use the airport lounge in Freetown so we weren‚Äôt hungry, but I felt extremely disappointed for my husband and the way he was treated by the air steward. 
We travelled overnight and legroom was limited. We were extremely uncomfortable throughout the flight. In the morning, we had cookies plunked in front of us and were offered tea, coffee or water - we weren‚Äôt offered anything more. My daughter asked for orange juice and she was firmly told they only had tea, coffee or water and the stewardess moved on. The most appalling customer service I‚Äôve ever encountered. I hope in time, other airlines would really take a chance on flying out to Sierra Leone and hopefully their customer care would be better than the customer care provided by Air France. To add to my misery, I paid for Wi-Fi, which never worked. Poor quality service.

Worst Airline to travel with Baby,Mumbai,Paris,International,"Worst Airline to travel with Baby.

We were three family member including the baby. For the conveince and comfort we booked 3 seats using option of Baby in seat. This is were our nightmare starts:

1) During the time of booking there was no reference of that we can only book baby in seat option if we have baby seat with us.
2) We had a FAA approved harness which is allowed for baby above 1 year which our baby is. This was validated by Air France team at BOM airport still no one had any objection that we do not have baby seat. All was good as we had the baby harness.
3) The momemt we started setting our baby so that we all can travel in comfort once the plane was in air and seat belt sign was off we were told we need to carry baby on lap as we do not have car seat.
4) Not just told we were made to carry baby on lap inspite of we had baby seat and baby harness.

Question: If the policy is baby in seat can be allocated only with baby seat than that should be clearly mentioned while I was bookign the tkts.

This chaos also applied to boarding, the same ground crew at the check in chaos were managing the boarding, they were totally chaotic and could not organise a P***up in a brewery!!  It does need sorting.

Once on the plane the flight crew were excellent and very accommodating throughout the flight.  The seat was comfortable and you were supplied with comfortable pillow, blanket and slippers for the journey.

The food and beverage were good, with the food being presentable and tasty at the right portions, of course there was a good supply of wine if you required it.

There was also a great selection of snax should you want further nourishment during the flight.  The good thing I noted was that there were always two/three attendants in the food area and walking about, not like they all cleared off to sleep after the meal service like on some airlines.

The IFE was not the best, with a poor selection of films and a lot of the visual stuff being in French and dubbed. There was a good music section, for my choice, and I listened to this most of the flight.

The lounge arrangement in HND could be improved and the F&B selection was very poor, however, at CDG it could not be faulted, although as it was small, it became quite crowded at the 0800 flight time.

"Crap food, crap attitude, crap airline.  Nothing more to say.",London,Bangkok,International,"What an absolute shower.  Flights delayed, missed connections (despite our plane being at the gate for 30 minutes while we were standing ready to board).  Their ground staff are belligerent and arrogant.  Plane food was really poor, to the point of being inedible and the plane was not clean (there was a ladies bra in my seat cupboard!).

An Utterly Dreadful Airline,Birmingham,Tokyo,International,"This was a flight from Birmingham to Pars outward bound, with a connecting flight to Tokyo for a touring holiday. The trip inbound was from Osaka to Paris, connecting to a flight to Birmingham. Each of the legs of the journey ran late so much so that the connecting flight from Paris to Tokyo left without us! 

We were re-booked onto a flight 24 hours later which was the time that was shaved off a very expensive 11 day trip. 

We were not advised what to do on arrival at Charles De Gaulle Airport at around 11pm even though it seemed inevitable that we had missed the flight to Tokyo. At that time of the night the Airport was essentially shut down and no Air France staff were present to advise us as to what the situation was i.e. we had missed our connecting flight to Tokyo. 

Somehow we happened onto the Customer  Services Desk

We had to endure a very uncompromising group of awful Air France staff operating as Customer Service representatives. They were collectively rude, dismissive, arrogant and not the least bit interested in listening or understanding any issues that the passengers had. There were about 8 of us. 

That it was the failure of Air France to bring us from Birmingham to Paris in a timely manner was of no consequence to the Customer Services Staff; I was met with a blunt ""you didn't manage to catch your plane. It is gone."" (shrug shoulders / could not care less) Little or no help o advice was offered. No acknowledgement or apology on behalf of Air France

Without any compromise seats were booked on a flight the following day - 24 hours later. Take it or leave it! No matter that we had paid for preferred seats on the flight that we had missed at ¬£52 each in Premium Economy we were allocated 2 seats in the middle of the back row - seats we would never have picked out of choice. Again shrug shoulders and a case of tough luck Buster for a flight that was going to last 13 hours 

In the interim, an inedible snack box was issued  in lieu of an evening meal together with a bag containing a tee shirt, toothbrush & toothpaste sand a razor. Vouchers were given to us for a train shuttle to an airport hotel the station for which was a 20 minute walk away. The Airline woman pointed vaguely to the far end of a long corridor to indicate where the station was, failing to say that the station was on a lower floor. We had to find the hotel ourselves which looked as it it was one of perhaps a dozen hotels in the dark - perhaps 300 meters from the shuttle station. 

Also 2 meal vouchers were issued valued at 15 Euros each to pay for breakfast and lunch. So basically the vouchers were to provide meals and beverages for a 24 hour period! 

This is the first and last time I will travel with this horrible airline.

Since Air France and other European carriers earn a lot from Indian customers, it is advisable that they have on board at least one Hindi/Punjabi speaking crew to assist those passengers.

Fly with anyone else but Air France,Vancouver,Barcelona,International,Flew from Vancouver to Paris and arrived at 8:00am and had connecting flight to Barcelona at 10:00am. Arrived in Paris to find AirFrance cancelled my connecting flight and could not get me on another flight until 10:pm. No reason or explanation. After asking with deaf ears what my options were we were advised to get our luggage and leave the terminal and go to there office located on the departure side of the airport. After about a half hr of back and forth we were finally given a couple of food vouchers. I told them we had been up for 20 hours and it was now about 4:00 am our time and we were exhausted and asked them if they just expected us to hang around the airport for another 10 hours waiting for our flight and that we had booked a hotel in Barcelona. They gave us a form and told us they would cover a hotel for up to 120 euros each but would have to pay for it then make a claim when we got home which is what we did. When we arrived back home 2 fo our pieces of luggage were missing. We were at the carousel with about 30 other people who's luggage was also missing. We were told to be patient as multiple planes were arriving . We all waited for about 2 hours and then went to their missing baggage dept. They asked us for our baggage claim numbers and they had a printed out sheet and informed us all that our luggage was still sitting in Paris. Could you not have informed us of that instead of making us all wait 2 hours. Four days later I woke up to find my luggage sitting on my front porch for anyone to steal. The bags looked like they had been thrown out of the plane. One suitcase was ripped in 3 spots and the handle completely ripped off. I made a claim and attached several pictures as well as the receipt for our hotel. Never heard anything back for almost one month and finally received an email about how busy they were and were looking into it and wanted me to resubmit all my pictures again which I did. I sent roughly another 5 emails over the next 3 months and never once got a response. Finally about 5 months later I got an email saying that because we did not need to spend the night in Paris they would not cover our hotel even though their customer service advisor at their office in Paris told us to do this and handed us a form with explanation of how to go about making a claim. They then wanted me to resubmit our pictures of our luggage and a receipt of purchase of this luggage. It is a few years old and who keeps receipts like that. Resent all pics and said I think the case was worth about 100 dollars as it was a couple of years old so I thought that was fare. It has now been almost 9 months since this claim was filed and still have not been reimbursed one penny.

Never again with Air France / Sky Team Partners,Paris,Zurich,Europe,"Never again!
AF managed to loose my luggage twice in less than 12 months.

This time from Shanghai via Paris to Zurich.
No one (at airport, at callcenter, via E-Mail) will be able to tell you details.
No one cares.
No one at AF seems to have empathy for their customers.
You will end up in endless callcenter loops talking to people that hardly speak English  and cannot tell you anything about your case.
You will also end up filling out terrible online forms with poor usability and zero value add for yourself.

Missing Baggage,Paris,Athens,Europe,"I would be negligent if I didn't warn others regarding Air France customer service when it comes to missing luggage. My first trip to Athens was almost ruined due to their negligence and lack of concern regarding my baggage. I arrived at Athens only to discover that my baggage was still in Paris. It was not lost and I was never given an explanation as to why it didn't arrive. At the baggage counter I made a missing baggage report and was told that my baggage would be on the next day flight and it would be delivered to my hotel. Mind you I had no clothing, shoes, underwear, toiletries, etc. and I was told to get what was needed and file for reimbursement. That was the beginning of the lies and horrible customer service I experience with Air France. 

So there I was in a foreign country on a Saturday evening not knowing the lay of the land. I was able to get a few things by the grace of God. Then next day my baggage arrived in Athens but was not delivered. So another day goes without my baggage with no explanation as to why it wasn't delivered. I get a few more necessities. That Monday afternoon I receive my luggage and the rest of my time in Athens was fantastic. I get home and make a claim for the items I purchased while my baggage was missing for 2.5 days. I submitted all the receipts that I had for the things I purchased to Air France. The customer representative for Air France determined that I was eligible for $20. I was absolutely livid when I received that email and responded that $20 was an insult to my integrity and DO NOT deposit that amount to my account. I thought that would be the last communication with Air France but they actually deposited $20 to my account as if that was great customer service.

Told as economy customers we mean nothing,Manchester,Santiago,International,"Absolutely shocking! To start with we are delayed by 24 hours! In total the journey will be taken roughly 48 hours! When we finally arrived in Paris we had to queue to sort out connecting flight and hotel for the night. For some reason the guy decided to split us up and put us both in middle seats. After we'd originally booked to sit together. Usually we wouldn't mind. But considering this is our honeymoon we hoped to spend the 14 hour flight sat together. This is after he asked if we wanted separate rooms at the overnight hotel?!? We did mention how it had been an awful start to our honeymoon. We finally get to the hotel for 330am, so not really over night. Nobody told us they stopped doing shuttle buses back to the airport the next day. So we had to get a taxi (we'll be demanding compensation for this) and if we had got the last shuttle back we would have then had to sit around at the airport for 12 hours. We aren't the type to complain and really do try and look on the bright side. But the way we've been spoken to in France by the Air France staff has been shocking. They are rude, dismissive and have zero sympathy. Twice we was basically told that because we was economy customers we could expect nothing except food vouchers. And it continues, just when we thought it would end. My wife has now had one of her food vouchers rejected. When I went to question this and admittedly I got frustrated, when the response was, ""well, you'll just have to try again"" and I said ""so my wife goes hungry. The Air France staff member just turned away to another disgruntled customer. She's now just left her post and no one is there to sort our issue. We are now waiting on the inevitable rejection when it comes to boarding, just to top it off.

This was on Christmas Eve. They gave me a ticket for the next day and said if I checked in early, they could make sure my bags got on the right connection. I came back to the airport early the next day to make sure everything would go smoothly, but sure enough, when I got to Morocco, one of my bags was missing. I waited around for 2 hours to try to get someone to talk to me and finally the agent said I would just have to file a claim. So I did, hoping they would find the bag and send it to me while still in Morocco. They didn‚Äôt even try. Then their system deleted my claim, so I made another one. No one ever contacted me, so I filed a missing bag report. No one ever got back to me so I tried calling. I would wait for hours to try to get a person and when someone would answer, they would say they couldn‚Äôt help and  transfer me to a dead line. Time went by and this missing bag claim got deleted as well. I filed yet another missing bag claim and they finally wrote me back saying that since it‚Äôs been longer than 21 days, the claim is invalid so my bag is gone and they are sorry but I won‚Äôt get anything for it. What manipulative, diabolical policy is this?! This has been a terrible experience. Because of this one bag and their absolute carelessness, I hate this airline. I will make sure to take a different airline even if the prices are double, because I have no trust in them.",2022-12,2023-03-30,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

My friend and me were travelling with a wheelchair.
When booking I was told I had to book one of the front seats because my friend can't walk far without her wheelchair.
After checking in we were rushed to go to boarding, so we had no chance to eat, drink or smoke.
When at the gate, Air France completely forgot about us at let everyone board while we had to wait in a box made of glas than was lifted to the back entrance where we were refused entry before everyone else had boarded and seated.
I felt like being in a zoo and we were the animals. We were then let in last and everybody stared at us when we came in. Due to the entrance in the back, my friend had to walk all the way to our seats in the front (which I never wanted to have as I prefer sitting in the back)

5 days before departure they just cancelled the flights and offer no adequate alternative. Just a new flight that arrives 4!!! days later saying we dont have anything else.....Default response is we can refund. When you go on their website oh wonder they do have available flights on the original dates but at a higher price point.....I feel defrauded honestly, absolutely terrible.

Missing baggage,Istanbul,Houston,International,"I had the unfortunate experience of having lost baggage while flying internationally with AirFrance to the wedding of a friend. I was informed on arrival that my baggage was left in Paris and it wouldn't arrive in time for the wedding. I was told costs would be compensated for any purchases necessary and given a brochure about how to track my bag and how to submit receipts for reimbursement. I ended up having to call daily for 18 days in order to track down my baggage and was told contradicting information during most of those calls. It did finally arrive 18 days later, but AirFrance has refused to provide any compensation for the costs of clothing and toiletries needed while waiting. They claim I never responded to their email, despite proof that I have each time anything was requested. 

Lost baggage happens but typically airlines make sure it is delivered as soon as possible to the customer's requested address. After this experience, I really could not recommend AirFrance, especially if other airlines (even if more expensive) are available. If you do choose to fly with AirFrance, please consider getting travel insurance to compensate if something goes wrong. I really wish I had.

Of note, the flight itself and the flight staff were great. Even the attendant who informed me of the missing bag was kind and helpful. The issues were all with customer service after I left the airport.",2022-10,2023-03-23,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

You couldn't make it up!!,London,Rome,Europe,"Air France failed to advise us in advance that service could be affected by a strike in France, if they had we could have changed to a direct flight. So we flew to Paris, the flight was late, we missed our connection to Rome. Their solution was to transfer us to KLM and fly us from Paris to Rome VIA AMSTERDAM??!! When the flight to Amsterdam was also delayed by the strike and we knew we would miss the connection to Rome they refused to have any more to do with us, saying it was now KLM (their partner airline) who would deal with us and give us overnight accommodation in Amsterdam.  They told us if we wanted to stay in Paris and get a flight from there to Rome the next morning they would not pay for it. Many upset and angry passengers at the desk and four ""customer service reps"" hiding in the office at the back having a chat, leaving two overworked staff to deal with it. The agent we eventually saw admitted that we'd be better off leaving France as the strike was expected to continue the next day.  The only useful communication we got from them. So we went to Amsterdam, and eventually got to Rome after 28 hours of travel. Bad enough, but on the way back 3 days later (no strike now) the same thing happened, the flight was 45 minutes late leaving Rome and we were advised to ""run through the terminal"" and we might catch the connecting flight home. Guess what? The connecting flight was actually on time, and despite getting to the gate 10 minutes before, they refused to let me on. I was at least given accommodation in a CDG airport hotel, but finding your way out of the terminal is a nightmare, inadequate signage, nobody around to help, I eventually found 4 red jacketed ""helpers"" standing in the station having a chat and the helped me find the shuttle. The only pleasant experience of the day was the kind guy behind the Ibis check in desk, but guess what? He was English!

Air France lost my belongings and their remboursement policy is just a joke,Paris,Florence,Europe,"AirFrance has lost my baggage and didn't provide me the slightest support when I called the earth team at Charles de Gaulle airport. Moreover they corresponded me a compensation which, not only is ridiculously inferior to the real amount I have lost, but that I will also never receive as they transferred the money to the WRONG BANK ACCOUNT. I believe that AirFrance reimbursement policy is only a fassade and I consider myself absolutely dissatisfied with this treatment as:
 
- AIR France only accepts paper receipts as proof of payment, no card movements or bank statements are accepted.  I would like to know why in 2023 are bank statements not an acceptable proof of payment, given that they include my full name and my card number they are q more solid proves of my personal purchases compared to a nameless receipt. Anyways, if this is the rule you should the victims know from the beginning. Failing to do so, naturally, jeopardizes their capacity of receiving their due compensation.

- they asked me to provide paper receipts three/four months after my baggage was lost. How do you expect people to keep paper receipts of any kind of item for months after they were bought? 

- air France transferred the forfeit reimbursement to the wrong bank account, as they didn't check my bank details first.

The Worst Airline EVER,Washington DC,Paris,International,"On Wednesday 2/22/23, my boyfriend and I were scheduled to travel back to the US from Paris, France. Due to the lack of help, direction, understanding, and competence of the Air France employees, we missed our flight home. 

Upon arrival there was a lack of communication regarding where to check in and what we had to do for the tax refund. The check-in and the refund process took longer than expected due to lack of direction from airport employees. When we finally arrived at the TSA line I asked the TSA employee if we would make our flight due to the time. We were told by 3 TSA workers we would make our flight, and they refused to move us ahead of the line. 

Once it was my turn to walk through the scanner, my bag was pulled for further search. The elderly woman ahead of me had an issue and made a scene because she was going to miss her flight. 

Instead of continuing with TSA searches most of the TSA workers stopped working to tend to the elderly woman. In the middle of this drama I told a TSA male worker I had to go or I'd miss my flight. He aggressively told me it was not his problem and I have to wait. All of the workers refused to acknowledge my concerns and ignored me.  

My boyfriend went ahead of me to the gate to explain the situation to the Air France boarding team. A black male worker (unsure if he was management) rudely dismissed my boyfriend when he tried to explain the situation.  My boyfriend proceeded to show him on Facetime what was going on at the TSA search. The Air France workers were now fully aware of the situation.  By the time I arrived at the gate, they closed the doors and refused to let us on the plane. 

We asked why they didn't say from the beginning we wouldn't be let on? We also question why they were so aggressive and mean to us. At this point the workers became aggressive. My boyfriend approached the black male worker to ask his name for this report. He refused to provide his name and told my boyfriend, ""don't worry about my name, I have your information"". The manager on duty proceeded to get in my face, point his finger and yelled telling me to shut up, to behave and not act like an American, and then threaten to call the cops. 

They then refused to help us at the gate with ticketing. We were sent to 5 different locations throughout CDG to try to get our flight rebooked. Every ticketing booth gave a new reason as to why they could not assist us. 

My boyfriend ended up calling Delta directly, which is the ONLY reason we had a flight for the following day. 

We had to pay for the flight change and hotel. I also had to use my last sick day at work due to this inconvenience.

We flew home business class which was FILTHY! Considering the amount of viruses and the amount of money spent to travel in business class; I was shocked at the amount of dirt and filth on our seats. I have pictures and video of the seats and dirt I cleaned off.

Jointly and separately my boyfriend and I travel often around the world and throughout the USA; we've never been treated this way, let alone threatened by people who are supposed to make travel safe.

This is my first time doing this type of report. I feel strongly about this and believe the air travel department should know Americans are not welcomed or treated well in Paris; more specifically CDG airport. 

I would like this entire situation investigated. I have an image of the manager who threatened us. I‚Äôm sure the airport has cameras to validate my story. 

I would also like a refund considering the conditions of the plane and how we were treated.

Air France  Stands above the Rest -!!,Madrid,Paris,Europe,"Superior Experience

My review on my first Air France flight, from Madrid to Paris! 

I have flown millions of miles in first class, premium class and coach, and have achieved Ambassador level status at major hotel chains, and while I‚Äôve had the pleasure of experiencing excellent service, AirFrance stands out above and beyond all of my travel experiences!

From booking, through the most amazing check in experience, to the people and airplane, 100 out of 10 experience !!! WOW WOW WOW! 

Superior Flight Check In: The check in process and web design are both flawless, intuitive, easy and fast! It‚Äôs so good, I never want to fly another airline again! 

Superior Team: I believe the gate agents and flight attendants deserve to be titled Humble Airline Executives. They are professional, wildly competent and intelligent, and exude both leadership confidence and humbleness simultaneously. They are truly a level above any team I‚Äôve experienced in over 30 years of travel.  

Superior Plane: the isle is wide enough to pass effortlessly with a carry on behind you, the seats are comfortable and the plane feels modern and fresh! 

I don‚Äôt know what more anyone could ask for on a flight !

"Missing Bag, costumer service and airport services.",Canton of Geneva,Miami,International,"We flew from Geneva to Miami with a connecting flight in CDG Paris. 

We flew on Sunday the 26th of February. Before landing in Miami, we were informed our bags were delayed. 

An employee from AirFrance was waiting for us to take our info and provide the claim number. He stated that the bags were located and were going to arrive next day. 

The following day, we received 2 bags out of 3. As logical we contacted AirFrance as soon as possible through all possible channels to inform them we were still missing a bag. To be sure we decided to pass by the airport, to make sure they were informed, it looked like they didn‚Äôt. 

Next day, we called again same response no news as where the bag was. As a result, we decided to pass by the airport again. We spoke we the same employee that received us when we landed and incredibly he didn‚Äôt even know that we where missing a bag (he is the guy in charge apparently for missing bags). Even though we called and went to the airport. His response was that we were doing everything wrong, that the costumer service for missing bags is not for that..

Lost luggage since 9 months,Mahebourg,Paris,International,"Worst experience ever !
9 months that we have been waiting for a 23kg luggage.
My husband and his grandpa both had a LHR layover from MRU to CDG last year. Both lost their luggage. Thankfully, after so many calls, complaints and visits to the airport, a month and some days after his grandfather got his bag back.
My husband's though, which they said they would deliver the next day never came. It is full of stuff we hold on to emotionally. We call them everyday, some days without answer and when they do, they are so mean and unhelpful.
Worst customer service ever experienced ! They should not be allowed to operate with so many failures in delivering customers their goods.",2022-06,2023-02-21,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0
Double standard,Nairobi,Montreal,International,"I recently flew with AirFrance from Nairobi, Kenya, to Montreal, Canada, with a 12+ hour layover in Paris CDG. The service on the plane was mostly courteous though on more than one occasion, I did overhear some of the flight attendants openly complain about some of the passengers. I expect more professionalism from an airline of this grade. 

For my long layover in Paris, CDG, I opted for buying a day access to the lounge. When it was time to pay, around 79 Euros, the lounge receptionist suddenly changed her mind and notified me that the lounge was full; priority was to be given to business class travellers. It was around 6:30am on a Saturday and I could clearly see the lounge was only at about 10% capacity. I don‚Äôt know what made her change her mind but from thereon, there was no reasoning with her. She did offer me to change my ticket for a business class ticket for close to 600 Euros, which I declined.  

I am a frequent user of the Air Canada lounges around the world and have never experienced what I can only attribute to snobbism. I had already been quoted a fee for access to the lounge. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Fantastic overall experience. Amazing food and service. 5 STARs,Florence,Washington DC,International,"I flew Air France in Business Class last November.  From the moment we arrived at the airport in Florence, IT , connecting in Paris and arriving at Washington Dulles, the entire experience was incredible.  Airport staff was friendly and efficient. Service onboard each flight was professional, attentive and friendly. True professionals the way flight attendants used to be in the '60s and '70s.  The food on both flights was as fine as a 5 star French restaurant.  Simply amazing. I've been in the travel industry for over 45 years and experienced in-flight service on many different airlines in all classes over the years.  I have never experienced such perfection as these Air France flights. This is not the Air France I remember from the '80s. They used to be awful.  However, if this is the new Air France,  I will fly them whenever I can in the future.",2022-11,2023-02-17,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
Awful airline with the worst customer service!,Manchester,Rio de Janeiro,International,"Air France lost my baggage on both outbound and return flights. Both were returned in 48 hours however this happened to a lot of the other passengers on both flights. The staff at the airport didn‚Äôt seem to care that peoples luggage was lost and I believe that is because it happens so frequently!

They made me pay ¬£400 at the check in desk. I had changed my outbound flight weeks before flying and had paid the difference and my new ticket was sent out to me. However when I got there they said I had not paid and demanded the ¬£400 else I could not fly. 
The worst part is the complaints service they have, they reply with a generic sorry and then close the complaint meaning you are unable to reply. I have sent several complaints, made several phone calls and sent several emails however getting nowhere. No one seems to know how to handle complaints efficiently, I‚Äôm still waiting to talk to the right person let alone receiving my money back!
Absolutely awful customer service, with no regard to their passengers! Would not recommend at all to anyone thinking about using this airline.",2023-01,2023-02-17,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
HORRID EXPERIENCE,Nairobi,Paris,International,"Air France could care less about their customers. We purchased upgraded seats a week before our departure, and when we went to check in online, we found our seats had been sold to someone else... We were forced to repurchase upgraded seats and contested the initial upgrade charge with my CC company. And good luck trying to talk with someone on the phone. They politely say, ""Sorry, I don't know what happened"". Yet this happened to 9 out of 10 of the people traveling in our group... And their website is useless from a phone. You have to use a computer to get anywhere. I will never use Air France again.

Please Read and Sea the photos,Paris,Dubai,International,"I will never travel with Air France again! They lost my suitcase and sent it back to me a day after, completely damaged and smashed! I sent them an email and complained right the minute I received my broken case which I bought just a year ago, so still kind of new and in a perfect shape. They replied to me after almost 3 months asking me for the purchase receipt and a form called DPR  which up to now, I still have not been able to receive from Air France here in the UAE. I absolutely hate the fact that they are not taking any responsibility, they are the ones who have not provided me with a DPR form even though I asked and have been following up. They are now saying they are unable to take the case further. I am really really disappointed and angry. Please do not travel with Air France. they need to learn how to deal with their customers. They don't even have a contact number to call and speak with them! I continue on my claim even if i have to pay more than the cost of luggage.

Smh,Paris,New York City,International,Where i begin. They lost my luggage. They then broke my luggage. I want my money back. The air hostesses were rude to me and ignored me when I asked them for some water. One of them had their bum in my face every time they stood up. She told me to sit down when was trying to have a wee. Jack rich kept farting. It stunk. There was skid marks in the toilet. And they smelled like p1ss. I was sat next to the biggest npc ever aka Samuel Whisspere I love him rly. The plain was too small. It crippled me. I was asleep and one of them tough my shoulder to wake me up asking if I want some water. She did this twice. After the second Rhine I told her to go away. I will never fly with this air lains ever again and I am going to sue them for damage of property. I also spent my last flight slagging them off thank you.,2023-02,2023-02-13,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
DISAPPOINTED - DO NOT RECOMMEND,London,Tampa,International,"The flight for 3 were booked in advance and confirmed. 24hrs before I tried to check in, but couldn't due to an error. Checked the airline website and seem as it was down. The website advised to check in at the airport. The day of travel on the way to the airport, I tried to check in again, but same issue. Then decided to contact the customer service, on the call the 1st agent said that the booking has been processed for refund. I asked when it was requested and they said 1 minute before. I clarified that there must have been a mistake or system error, as 1minute before I was trying to call them and no one else had access to the booking. The agent repeated himself couple of times and when I asked for resolution or how Air France can help, they said to call the complaints department and they will answer in 24/48hrs. I requested many times to cancel the refund and allow us to fly and asked how this would help when the flight was in 4hrs, but the agent said he could not help and hang up. Whilst on the call, we then received the email for refund!!  I called again and the 2nd agent said that it was all confirmed with the booking. 

When at the airport, we had to clarify everything at the check in desk but they were not able to help and advised to contact the customer service. None of the agents were able to help its customer or offer a solution and kept mentioning to buy new tickets. When asked for availability on the same exact flight, they said that it was fully booked. Therefore, we are 100% sure that they overbooked and made false statement that we issued for refund. This is truly disgusting system and behavior from Airfrance. Own up to your mistakes. 

Plus I have already filed complaint and compensation for the stress caused. Not ideal when we are flying for special occasion and have to deal with this ordeal. Additionally AirFrance said they can only refund for the taxes.. couldn't believe this, they make the mistake themselves and expect this from us. Nope, full refund is the minimum they can do, in this situation.",2023-02,2023-02-12,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
"Horrible, abusive airline",Toronto,Paris,International,"First we have the famous French customer service: the staff is rude and lazy. They get mad at the passengers when their isn't enough room in the overhead compartments instead of charging reasonable rates for checked bags or allowing passengers to check roller bags for free as other airlines do.

I'm 5'11"" 155 lbs and I couldn't fit in the seat. It's inhuman. 

Finally they forced us to pay over $200 to check our bags even though they fit well within what most reasonable airlines allow. 12kg between both carry on items is insane.

Premium economy : no value for money,Buenos Aires,Paris,International,"No value for my money with premium economy

I took the premium class between Buenos Aires and Paris: very disappointing with a hard and uncomfortable seat, a disgusting meal (tasteless pasta with mushrooms), almost identical to the eco class menu. And there I am ashamed to be French with such a showcase. The staff is charming and well educated but I would not travel again at this price in premium for a lousy service. Airfrance has, recently, a tendency to cancel flights and to modify the schedules a lot (10 hours on the Buenos Aires flight). And they actually cancel my flight to the Seychelles 1 month after buying it: is there a pilot in the Air France operations department with so many changes? And I took Emirates; and I didn't want to, and finally there was a good surprise: their economy class is as spacious as airfrance's premium class for much less. The meals are simple, copious and correct and more balanced than those of Air France which are junk (fat, sugar, pizza, pasta, not a lot of good proteins whereas I ate a chicken fillet on Emirates). there are also more drinks and you can refill. You have an omelet, fresh fruits.. for breakfast with emirates when you have a box with only junk food at the breakfast in premium Air France. So I would use Emirates next time for African or Asian destinations. I already give my feed back to Air France but no change. For sure,the airfrance accountant is choosing the menus (the cheapest possible) and also the seats (hard but cheap)",2023-02,2023-02-11,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,1.0

Best Airline Yet,Edinburgh,Paris,Europe,"Frequent flyer of Air France for over 20 years and although I have heard some negative comments, the airline has never let me or my family down. Customer service by phone and Messenger is great, and the booking experience is easy. Flying Blue is very rewarding and love being able to switch with Virgin Red points and vice versa. Level of cleanliness on the flights and at Paris CDG has always been good, and staff make you feel very safe while on the flight. Diversity is encouraged, which I definitely appreciate. Cabin crew are usually friendly and helpful, had a few bad experiences in the past although all resolved by AF after the flight. Food on-board is okay, although for a free short flight is quite impressive. Airport facilities at Paris CDG are very magnificent and sleek, had good experiences other than at border force, attitude from border staff is terrible compared to the UK and Spain although this isn‚Äôt fault of Air France. What really has impressed us is when things do go wrong, how well Air France handle it. Due to reasons out of their control, our flight got cancelled and we were upgraded to business for free to get home and airport hotel and 3 course meal was paid for - for economy class. That‚Äôs just amazing service. On another occasion, lost luggage was located after Manchester Airport had some handling issues and paid for one damaged suitcase to be replaced, even though it was just dented and got them back to us the next day by staff in a taxi. Another occasion, emergency landing Air France again provided great accommodation and upgraded to business from economy to get us home.

Excellent service from start to finish,London,St Martin / St Maarten,International,"After reading some of the reviews about Air France we were somewhat worried about our trip. There was no direct flight from the U.K. to St Maarten so we were booked with Air France. It is a shame that people only seem to write about the bad stuff on these reviews. Our flight from the U.K. to Paris left on time and even on the short 45 minute flight at 06:20 we were served a hot drink with lovely biscuits. The crew were all very professional and friendly. It was a bit of a rush in transit. Even though we flew into T2E and left from there it involved a monorail, security etc so make sure you allow plenty of time or stay overnight in Paris? We had 90 minutes but it was not enough time for shopping! Walking or rather rushing past the Louis Vuitton shop I was gutted. The AF498 from Paris to St Maarten left late but caught up some of the time. Champagne is complementary even in economy and they were very generous with it. The meal was excellent and we had a snack about an hour before landing. The inflight entertainment was very good too. The staff were lovely. On the return we had a night flight. Again all was very good but our connection only gave us 1 hour in Paris, this was only just enough to make the gate as the flight was called. I presume you would be put on another if you missed it. Only 1 of our cases made it back to Heathrow due to the short transfer time. We filled in a form, handed the luggage label to be scanned where they were able to see it was still in Paris. We had very good communication via text about when it arrived back in the U.K. and the delivery.

Disappointing Experience,Dublin,Sao Paulo,International,"Quite a disappointing experience from what I had considered a good airline.

Flight experience in general was average, food/beverages were fine and entertainment options poor. Staff were suprisingly quite rude, certainly the least approachable and helpful that we have come across. 

On top of that they made an error with our seats and tried to shift the blame to us which was dreadful behaviour. We had paid extra for seats and they weren't provided due to an error at their end, we asked to be upgraded as compensation and the attendant literally laughed as the next level seats were ""a higher tariff"" - the reality that we  were in ""lower tariff"" seats to what we had paid for didn't seem to matter. Mistakes can be made and we were very polite with our approach but the way this was dealt with and the general attitude of staff was disappointing and set our holiday off on a bad start. Trying to claim a refund now for the extra options and of course it's proving hugely difficult. Overall very disappointing.",2023-01,2023-02-01,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0

"In flight was fine, mediocre food.  Good movie selection.",Seattle,Rome,International,"I traveled for Christmas from Seattle to Rome to be with my fianc√©'s family.  I arrived but my luggage did not.  I was assured that my luggage would be delivered to me the next day.  My luggage did arrive on the next flight then was transferred to a courier service who held my bags for three and a half days.  Apple Air-tags are very handy devices.  All of my clothes, all of the gifts for family were in those bags.  When I finally did see my luggage the man who delivered handed me a piece a paper and said sign it, I looked at it and the paper stated he was delivering the suitcase three days prior.  My fianc√© spotted the scam and told the man that we would not sign the document as it is not accurate, the man then threatened to take my suitcase back again, which I was not going to let happen,  My dear fianc√© changed the date on the document, we signed and handed it back to the man who then began to shout profanities at us.  I thought for sure we were going to need the police, luckily the man kept walking albeit still shouting profanities at us.  I get my suitcase to my room and open it up, excited to start handing out gifts.  Turns out someone had rummaged through my suitcase and took all of the gifts.  A total of about $250 worth of items, not a huge loss monetarily speaking but I was so upset, violated that someone had done this.  I contacted the airlines immediately through the website and filed a claim.  I checked in on that claim for a little over a month.  Finally I received an email that told me that Air France is not responsible for stolen property while it is in their care, that I should file an insurance loss claim.  So travelers beware, Air France evidently has the right to take any item they want from your suitcase they want without repercussions.  This is a absurd response to a real life drama that occurred to me and my family because of  complete neglect on your part Air France.

"Auto-cancellation of booking, no refund and exceptionally poor service",Copenhagen,Paris,Europe,"On 07 FEB 2022 I made a reservation for my wife and our two kids to go on a trip from Copenhagen to Paris and back. After completion of the booking process, I received the message ""Your payment was successful! Your booking is now confirmed. We have sent a confirmation e-mail to: [my email address]"" and I received the confirmation via e-mail minutes later (kept a screenshot of the initial message from Air France for later reference, which I am very happy I did today). On this basis I believed everything was in perfect order and we went on to book hotel and plan the itinerary of the vacation.

However, when I wanted to verify the booking less than 48 hours before departure I found the following message in Air France‚Äôs booking system: ""Sorry, all the flights in this booking have been cancelled"". As we had at this point in time already booked and paid for the hotel in Paris and made plans for our stay, we couldn‚Äôt just cancel our trip with such a short notice. Hence, I saw no other alternative than to rebook the original tickets right away. However, at this point in time the price of the exact same tickets was suddenly 470 EUR higher, which I was of course not willing to accept.

Already the next morning (Tuesday 15/03/2022) at 8 am I therefore called the Air France Service Line and thankfully I got to speak with a very service-minded agent by the name Brenda (after waiting in line for most of an hour!). She looked into the case, got help from colleagues and called me back with the message that the strange and un-announced cancellation of the original booking was caused by a system bug / technical issue on the side of Air France. In brief, Brenda informed me that my original booking had been ""auto-cancelled with no notification""! Therefore, according to Brenda, I would indeed qualify for a refund of the price difference between the original booking and the new booking I had to make the preceding evening, i.e. I should qualify to get back the before-mentioned difference of approximately 470 EUR.

I straight away followed the instructions by Brenda and filled an official claim to get back the difference in price between my original tickets for Paris and the new tickets, which I had to book due to the system bug in Air France‚Äôs booking system. Along with the claim I provided my screenshot of from the original booking as well as a detailed description of the story (as provided here).

On this basis one should think it would be easy for Air France to deal with the case but once again they disappointed badly. When they finally answered my request on 31/10/2022 (after 230 days!) they wrote:

‚ÄúOn an internal audit, it seems that your initial payment was not successfully transferred. Please allow me to explain that when you made the booking, the authorisation code was generated and forwarded by the banks via their automated systems. Unfortunately, on this occasion, I note that your booking was confirmed, and the payment got cancelled. Whenever a booking is made, payment is blocked from the bookie‚Äôs account, which then gets validated by our robotic systems. Regrettably, the original authorisation code generated for approval of your payment was expired, and in the absence of payment, the tickets were never issued. However, I would like to clarify that as per our policy, we never send a reminder of payment or confirmed ticket until and unless the ticket is issued.‚Äù

This seems to be a rather longwinded way of saying: ‚ÄúYes, we did indeed experience an IT glitch on our side as your booking was confirmed both on screen and via email while our IT systems malfunctioned, and we therefore didn‚Äôt manage to withdraw the payment. However, rather than contacting you regarding this issue we chose not to notify you in any way and rather than thanking you when you found out our auto-cancellation yourself and made the required rebookings we chose to charge you more than twice the original price. Too bad - you chose Air France yourself‚Äù

It is not that the amount is that huge (I ended up paying 786 EUR rather than 313 EUR) but the lack of professionalism exhibited by Air France and their lack of customer service is appalling. And surely, I feel cheated big time. My family and I have always enjoyed going on vacations in France (we have been there 7 times over the past 10 years and in the past I have both worked and studied there) but unless I receive my money back as well as an apology I will do my outmost to avoid Air France in the future. Their conduct in this case is blatant cheating combined with absolutely sub-standard customer service. 

So if you want to take my advice then avoid Air France if you can in any way! Their booking system apparently suffers from random IT bugs and technical issues, which can basically lead to your booking being auto-cancelled with no notification! And their willingness to help and reimburse in case of errors on their side is non-existent.",2022-03,2023-01-28,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Increase in ticket prices - decrease in quality,Paris,Santiago,International,"I understand that with the pandemic crisis, the war and other current factors everything must have gone up in price, but why does quality have to suffer?

To begin with, the staff seemed to be always annoyed.
Then, it was very cold in the cabin and the blanket they gave us was ridiculously thin and not warm at all.
The final straw was the meals. Dinner was served very late.
The printed menu no longer exists; the portions are ridiculously small and the quality just cheap. I tried it and had to leave it.
Breakfast... they gave us a little bag, no tray. It looked like a children's menu, like MacDonald's happy meal.
A warm and wet brioche with a weird cheese, a tiny ciabatta, a square of butter, a liquid yogurt, a bitter orange juice, a fruit salad that looked like fruit pulp. For some reason the bottom of the paper bag was wet, consequently the napkin and the useless wooden cutlery as well.
I had to hold the coffee with one hand because, having no tray, it slid across the table, the same with other things. I ended up laughing, it was too absurd.

Edward Yeo,Paris,Johannesburg,International,"Worst airline experience ever. I flew from Casablanca to Johannesburg via CDG recently. 

The first flight was late and served one soggy roll over 3 hours. 

The second flight was cancelled due to mechanical issues after sitting in the plane on the ground for 5 hours. EU citizens and visa holders were taken to hotels were they had warm meals, a shower and a private room. The small group of us without visas were told that the in terminal hotel was full and that we were to just sleep in the terminal. The hotel was in fact not full, some group members booked in privately and said there was loads of space. Seems non EU customers aren‚Äôt worth the housing requirements as set out in Air France customer bill of rights. 

We were given food vouchers for a convenience store so at least we could buy sandwiches of cool drinks. 

Myself and several other passengers had missed connections in Johannesburg and so Air France booked flights to the various connections. Upon arrival in Johannesburg, the connecting airlines had no record of the bookings. Air France had just printed fake tickets. As if we wouldn‚Äôt try use them or anything. 

At this point most passengers still needing connections had been traveling for almost 2 days and were in no mood for Air France. Which is good because the Air France counter was unmanned and help lines were not open. 

Seems like most, myself included, booked our own tickets home and will definitely be emailing a frenzy to be repaid.

"AF lies, resells seats you purchase, denied 30 people to board even though there 100 minutes prior",Antananarivo,Paris,International,"Air France is not only unethical and unprofessional, but is  the worst airline we have ever flown in the world.

HORRIBLE - DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE,New York City,Paris,International,"I recently flew with AirFrance from New York to Paris. This was for my husband and I‚Äôs honeymoon. My experience with the airline was horrendous from start to finish.

Firstly, our flight was delayed from 11:55pm to 1:55pm, however, the flight originally came up as cancelled. This sent us into a complete state of panic. We came to realize that this also happened to other passengers on flights departing at 11:30pm and 11:55pm. We were already at the airport early, as suggested, and waited around at the gate. The gate changed about three times. We ordered food with a voucher from the airline that did not even cover what we ate. 2:30pm comes around and we still have not boarded the plane. We did not end up taking off until about 10 minutes to 4:00am.

When we landed in Paris and headed over to the baggage claim we came to realize that they did not have my husband‚Äôs luggage. We waited around to see if it was recovered and it was not. Hours later, we had to file a claim for the missing bag. This left my husband with no clothes or belongings for the trip. We had also missed one of our planned excursions and dinner reservation. I sat on the line with the airline the next morning. This call took over an hour to go through. The man who answered was completely rude and I heard his colleagues laughing at my distress in the background.

We spent the next day shopping at lower priced stores to get clothing for my husband. These were not clothes that we would normally buy, however, we did not know what our limits were for spending and wanted to be respectful.

I spent many more hours on hold with AirFrance to receive very little help. When we went to the airport for our return, they still did not have answers about our luggage. They even tried charging us for an oversized suitcase until I broke down crying. We had to pack my husband‚Äôs suitcase with extra clothes in order to get our belongings home. They finally relented.

It is January 18th and our belongings are still not recovered. I was told to file a claim for our delayed flight. After spending time filing this claim and going back and forth with a customer service representative, I was told that we were not eligible for the reimbursement. I tried to email the representative back and he stopped answering me. I have filed a claim for the clothing we bought, which does not come close to what was lost in the suitcase. I have not received a call or any reimbursement for this horrible experience. AirFrance‚Äôs lack of consideration, efficiency and assistance completely ruined our honeymoon. We will never get this experience back. I am hoping that something will be done about this. I cannot spend more hours of my time on this issue. I wrote to the NY CEO of AirFrance 2 weeks ago and still have not heard back. They don't care about their customers.",2022-12,2023-01-18,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

No one responsible in a Code Share.,Boston,Bengaluru,International,"My family  travelled roundtrip from Boston to Bangalore India this month. It has been the worst travel experience in my life. It was KLM ticket with no KLM flights, but just Delta and Air France operated flights. Boston to Paris was Delta operated. I forget my cell phone on the plane. At the gate to onward flight I let Air France staff know about it and asked if they could help. Their answer was that I should report it at the end of all segments of the travel.  A standard answer to get rid of me.   When I tried to report it at the end of journey, the answer was I should have talked to Delta staff in Paris. There is no way Air France staff can help.  I never got my phone back. I guess it was my fault that forgot it. 
Trip back was even worse. Online check in is not possible with code share in place.  When Air France staff check us in they moved my wife ticket out of the group. I had not realized this until I reached New York( we were put on flights to NY then on to Boston from Paris). W were given boarding passes only till Paris. When in Paris we were told that we would flown to NY(JFK) and then to Boston.  When we reached NY(JFK) Delta staff told us that my wife is not in the group and that she would need to buy a ticket from NY and to Boston.

I understand that sometimes these things happen and due to the safety of the passengers we had to get off the plane but it is what happened afterwards that made me not want to fly Air France ever again. 

We were told to go to a new gate, once we went there the staff were confused as to why everyone had questions and why we were there. One staff member told us that our boarding passes had 11 Euro vouchers on them but when we all went to get food the vouchers did not work. We had to go to another Kiosk to get the vouchers. We then started informing other people because the staff did not care to make any announcements telling people anything. 

We then asked again when boarding will begin because the sign says 4:20 boarding but we received our vouchers at 4:23...which didn't leave us time to even get the food. We were assured there was enough time so we did but then they started shuttling all passengers to the new plane. They made all the passengers carry their items down the stairs outside with no assistance to buses. 

The buses took us to the new plane where we had to carry our items up more stairs. No assistance was provided for any passengers. Elderly people had to carry their items and passengers started helping eachother. 

The new plane was very dirty, it seemed they didn't have time to clean it before we got on. 

Once we got on the plane no apology was given by the airline.

I live in Czech Republic and I have spent 1 month in Spain. I had to take casual and business clothes with me, as well as gym clothes. In consequence, I do not have clothes to work tomorrow, neither for my gym session. Additionally, I have my winter jacket in the missing baggage. Being in Prague and being in winter, I can not go anywhere without it.

For this reason, I am going to buy at least some business clothes and gym clothes so I can make it through the day tomorrow. AirFrance does not want to compensate for any of the costs involved on this as they say I have a permanent, and not a temporary address.

I do not care what the policy say, this is going to cost me money and make me waste time.

Being such a well known company, I always trusted AirFrance. The whole experience of missing a baggage starts on the airport, where you are waiting for longer as your bags do not come. Then filling all the paperwork on the baggage claim desk. Afterwards, having to call the company and waiting for customer service to answer so you can get to follow up your case with disappointment to hear that it is not going to make it on the right time. Followed by wasting time shopping things that you already have.

How is possible that a customer can not be compensated for such a cost, waste of time, and bad experience?

I will not use AirFrance anymore. Big disappointment.",2023-01,2023-01-08,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0
Vacation,Cincinnati,New Delhi,International,We arrived in Delhi on a Friday. We waited 1.5 hours at the carousel only to be told our luggage did not arrive. No explicable reason as to why as we arrived at the airport in plenty of time and there was ample time for transfer of luggage at Paris to Delhi flight. We were told luggage would arrive the following day on the same flight. 72 hours later we still have not received the luggage as per AirTag location still shows luggage has not left Charles De Galle!,2023-01,2023-01-07,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
Amazing airline amazing service,Vancouver,Paris,International,"Air France is among the best airlines I have ever flown with. The airline provides the best inflight service ever. Air France provides complimentary champagne in economy class! 

The food was amazing! One of the best airline food I have ever tasted in my flying experiences. 

The flight was delayed, but Air France handled the delay with a lot of professionalism and kept us informed, the fact that the airline maintained the flight due to the weather conditions was amazing. 

Inflight entertainment is good, not exceptional but you won't feel bored when flying with them.

The worst airlines,Dallas,New Delhi,International,Our flight from CDG to Delhi was cancelled on day 1 and it was delayed by more than a day. All passengers have to sit on the terminal.

A  pleasant experience overall!,London,Osaka,International,"We flew from London Heathrow to Osaka via Paris and back in December.  It was an enjoyable experience from start to finish (a little hectic at CDG Airport re wheel chair access and transfer to terminal).

Quick check-in and relaxing break in the lounges available.

On time departure.  Return journey was four hours longer due to Russian airspace issues and we had to fly from Japan via Canada, Alaska, Greenland!  However, we were well looked after by the crew.

Delicious French food and drinks served on all flights.  Champagne before take off. Snacks and drinks available on request during the flights.  Hot chocolate requested was absolutely divine!

Comfortable seating / bed made for a stress free journey.  Coats stored in the cabin hold.  Good quality entertainment.  Wi fi available. Very clean all round.

Outstanding cabin crew on all flights.  Multilingual.  Professional but friendly service.  Our thanks to all.

On our return flight one of our cases was not loaded on the plane at Paris airport.  As soon as we landed in London we received a text informing us of this and we were kept in regular touch as to the whereabouts of the case which was delivered 3 days later.  Slight inconvenience was caused but we appreciated being informed on time.

THE WORST! AVOID. LIKE THE PLAGUE!,Douala,London,International,"From booking to ticket office to check in to flight, staff are CONSISTENTLY rude, impatient, lie, make things up, give conflicting advice and then claim they know nothing about it.
After paying over ¬£2000 for a long haul flight claimed we weren't guaranteed hang luggage, even though they had let others on with massive bags. When we tried to ask why, we were told to move so they could deal with other waiting passengers!

Very rude uncaring staff. Never again.,Paris,Osaka,International,The staff behave shockingly rude and hardly smile. Treat customers like something in the way.  In every aspect of the flight the were rude. If you ask for some water for example the cabin attendant rolled her eyes and reluctantly asked what my seat number was and would bring it to me. Even handing out meals was done with an attitude and general disgust of the passengers.

Flight delays on Christmas eve,Milan,Monterrey,International,"Facts:
Flight Milan-Paris delayed 3 hours
I arrived at my final destination +24hrs (I expected to arrive on the 24 in the morning to celebrate Christmas eve with my loved ones; i arrived the 25 in the morning)

Negative outcomes of the situation:
- High levels of stress, resulting in a visit to the Medical centre for 3 hours (almost losing my rescheduled flight on Christmas eve)
- Use of credit card for unexpected expenses at the airport
- Family reunion was lost (the purpose of my trip)

Positive aspects of the experience

- The airline did not lose my luggage",2022-12,2023-01-06,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0

Air France Horrible,Paris,Atlanta,International,I was very displeased with my flight. My party included six people while all their bags made it to Atlanta my bag was left behind in Paris. They gave no notice of my bag being left behind. I will not trust my bag being checked again by this airline. I would think twice before booking with this airline.,2023-01,2023-01-03,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
Take NO repressibility for their mistakes and the inconvenience and loss they cause.,London,Bangkok,International,"I flew with them in the summer. My luggage was lost for 4 days. ON arrival their agent told me it will arrive that evening, and I can buy whatever I need, and after I asked, he said I can then file a claim when I arrive back to London. 
The luggage did not arrive for another 3 days.
When I got home I made a small claim for few items I bought, which was rejected because they relied on terms and conditions I did not read, that require filing within 21 days. But since my holiday after 3 years of covid was for 28 days, they simply declined. Relying on clauses that let them off. The claim was for about 5% of the purchase price of flying tickets. If they are as petty on such small claims and from business class, I would argue they will do anything to avoid liability, rather than care.
One more point. We had a connection flight with them. My suitcase also didn't arrive with us on the way back. But this time the delay was only 24-48 hrs, and there was no issue of compensation as it was a flight home. But really think twice before you book them with a connection.",2022-07,2023-01-03,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,1.0,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
Economy class surprise,Singapore,San Jose,International,"A drop in the ocean given the number of reviews but had to voice up. Im a Brit that usually pays a premium to travel non-western airlines such as Singapore Airlines (SIA).  But took AF for this very long family trip.  So impressed with the service and catering. It is now so much better than SIA (which partly also reflects SIA cost cutting since COVID).  AF film selection a tad too limited for non-french speakers compared to some other airlines but the service, pilot communication and economy class food were all excellent and hopefully a sign of a new, era for the airline.",2022-12,2023-01-02,5.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
2 000 Euros for a lost/ stolen bagge,Basel,Brisbane,International,"So, I paid 2 000 euros to fly from Basel Mulhouse to Paris, then Paris to Singapore and Singapore to Brisbane. I've decided to go before the Christmas season because AirFrance had planned to go on strike and I was meant to start work early January so I didn't want to miss my work opportunity. I modified my flight ticket, took my three flights and saw no luggage.
It's been 15 days now, and I've been trying to contact AirFrance through every way, but nobody is replying to me. They ignore me on Whatsapp, don't reply to email. They are not taking responsibility for it and want me to contact Qantas because this was my last flight. However, my baggage was last seen in Paris Charles de Gaulle. So, I believe one of their employee simply stole it as it vanished.
I also need to add Allianz insurance hasn't replied to me and their online form didn't work. So, it's been 15 days, I've had no financial help and no replies from anyone.
I've used AirFrance only  three times in my life and every single time, I've had an issue. Flight cancelled, flight date modified, luggage lost. You don't get an apology, the customer service is inexistant.
2 000 EUROS LOST. Christmas not spent with my family due to your strike and no apology. I will never use AirFrance AGAIN.",2022-12,2023-01-02,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,5.0
Why did I have to check my carry on bag. I feel like I was discriminated and will not take this airline again.,New York City,Mumbai,International,"I always travel light and purposely bought a carry on so that I could carry it on. But I was forced to check my bag. I then saw that most of the other passengers had much bigger bags than me. I was very confused by it and felt that I was discriminated against. This feeling of being unfairly treated makes m assured that I will never take this airline again.

Always loose customer's bag,New Delhi,Washington DC,International,"AF always loose customer's bag. We travelled through this airline in Aug from India to US via Paris and they lost one of our bag. We filed a claim but we haven't received our bag. Than later we found that it's not only me but thousands of people lost their bags. They are still loosing people's bag. It seems there is no authority to punish them hence they are taking this granted. When we call customer service and ask for help, we get very rude response and when we tell them that we report it to US DOT they proudly say that yes we can go ahead and report to US DOT.

Wish I had a no work job at AF,Asheville,Vienna,International,"We, but not my luggage, arrived in Vienna on the afternoon on 12/23/22. No worries, the luggage was located and placed on the next flight from Paris to Vienna and was to be delivered to my hotel that night. Unfortunately, the luggage rescue flight arrived after the lost luggage office was closed. Guess what, no one was there today, 12/24/22, either.  No one would answer the phone, an email, a text - I even opened a twitter account trying to get my luggage. I offered to go to the airport and pick it up. No luck.

It would be impossible for me to run my business with such blatant disregard for my customers.  These clowns could care less and one must assume that the average person you interact with at AF has no clue or simply can‚Äôt be fired.  

Oh well, I purchased a clean shirt, but unfortunately, while I was waiting for my luggage, Vienna shopping closed down. Hope I can go outside without freezing.

How crazy. If I should make an error, tough luck.  If AF stumbles, it‚Äôs still my problem.

Disrespect of American woman,Paris,Miami,International,"They will speak smack about you in French. My GF caught them talking crap. Don‚Äôt fly this airline if you have the chance. We flew for business, and we were told to go to the back of the plane to get alcohol. My girlfriend goes to the back of the plane, and she is bilingual. She asks for a drink in American, and the hostess calls her an alcoholic (this is her second drink); they also call her names I will not mention due to vulgarity. My GF then turns to speak French and surprises the hostesses due to her being bilingual.

they didn't fly my luggage to west africa,London,Freetown,International,"Not sure what any sane person would expect, but flying business to AFRICA from Heathrow Airport, I expected to have (silly me) my luggage containing PPE for the 7 day work trip on a mining site and basic hygiene items delivered to the destination. Especially since it was all paid. To my shock and horror, my luggage didn't move from Heathrow except to be changed from T3 to T2 on day 3 of my arrival in West Africa, where lovely weather and friendly mosquitoes, which bite even on the fingers becaused you may want to dare wash your hands every once in a while and so you also wash off the little repellant you had in your liquids bag. Horrible experience and even worse customer service from AirFrance. I have returned from West Africa and even on my arrival, despite having an Air Tag that showed the exact location of my luggage, nobody wanted to help. Even paying you're not getting the value of the services paid. What a despicable thing AirFrance does!! After contacting them in many occasions, via twitter, their own website, filing the lost luggage form, over the phone from the airport, AirFrance has fully ignored my request and has only deemed to blame it on the baggage handlers. Talking to the baggage handlers they send me back to AirFrance. And have done that on the day on my return from West Africa, for over 4 hours at Heathrow Airport.

Upgrade didn't work out,Detroit,Paris,International,"I had to go to Hamburg on short notice and booked flights via Delta Airlines from Detroit. Tried making this short trip to Germany as comfortable as possible for myself and got an upgrade to the Economy priority class, which made a very expensive ticket even more expensive at the time of booking. The seat I got assigned by the airline was not the seat I was in when I arrived at the plane. Nobody informed me that my confirmed window seat was given to someone else. That was irritating and uncomfortable. I appreciate the entertainment system and the general condition of the airplane, though. The crew was nice and the flight was okay otherwise. On arrival in Paris the transit gate was swamped by arriving passengers and unfortunately the upgrade didn't warrant a visit in the Air France lounge either. After a delay of the connecting flight the Air France hop captain made time up and actually got us to Hamburg on time. If possible in the future I'd rather avoid Air France and going via Paris. This was my first time flying with them. I used to fly KLM before and on the way back to the US.

Air France lost an entire flight‚Äôs checked in luggage,London,Paris,Europe,"I am due to have spinal surgery in Jan, this trip to Disney was my last chance to make memories with my little girls and husband.

The status said luggage in stand by. We eventually found an Air France rep who said that the whole flight arrived from Heathrow with no checked in luggage. How does that even happen? Plus why did they lie about not being to close the door to the plane due to luggage? My young children and myself and husband had nothing when we arrived in Paris only a small amount of hand luggage which they had tried to force us to check in (thank goodness I didn‚Äôt agree) I suffered all holiday with no medication and their phone lines just rang and cut you off many times.

Balarama Thavanati,Boston,Bengaluru,International,"Paid for an extra bag during online check in. During check-in at Boston airport, all 5 bags are checked in, but the staff at the counter only affixed 4 tags to the boarding pass. It was our mistake that we didn't cross-check.
At Bengaluru airport, we only got four bags.
We reported the claim, but there was no follow-up for more than 3 weeks. I gave all the details required at the airport.
Because the bag was taken in at Boston airport, I assume that during cross-checking with the system, they would have left the fifth bag at the Boston airport. 
But the Airfrance Bengaluru staff doesn't want to pursue this! They kept saying we sent an email to our Paris office and waiting for their response. No claim number or anything to track it.
And it is nearly impossible to get hold of the Bangalore Airfrance over the phone. And their excuse is that there are thousands of baggage inquiry calls.

SCAM with Airport Officials involved,Paris,Los Angeles,International,"US passport holders are directed to a separate line where their hand luggage is weighed by an airport official.  The personnel asked me and others in front of me to place our luggage, handbag, shawls, and even papers on the scale.  12 Kg limit. The woman in front of me had a weight below 12 Kg for all her belongings.  The man asked her to then put her shawl and Jacket on top.  Then he promptly asked her to pay 100 Euros and check it in.  Mine was above 12 Kg and was red-tagged.  As I went to check it in, there were some people who looked like immigrants that told me that I had to pay them the money to check it in.  The person who was weighing the bags was in conversation with them in French and knew everything that was going on.  So I believed them and gave them cash.  Then they put me on the wrong line.  By the time I found out and went to check in, it was too late.  They made me throw away most of the things in my hand luggage, without telling me that it was too late to catch my flight.  Then they made me go through security to re-book a flight that was only 2 hours later.  They could have been helpful at the check-in counter and told me to check in the luggage for the later flight and re-booked me.  To say the least, they were inimical towards passengers from the US.

Air hostess can be rude and unhelpful,San Francisco,Bengaluru,International,"It was long haul flight with stopover in Paris. Of the 4 flights we were in during the trip, 2 were fine. But the first leg was a bad experience. We are vegetarian and they wouldn‚Äôt serve vegetarian under kids menu and you can‚Äôt change a kids food option online. Usually airlines provide veg food inflight. Here the air hostess started talking at the top of lungs when we asked if we can get anything veg. We were polite with our request and not offensive in any way. But the lady shouted at us ‚ÄúWE GOT NO VEG‚Äù and just stormed off. We adjusted with what veg they served to me and my wife. But what was disturbing is the way she behaved with us. She was normal with most others it was just us she seemed not to like. We were armed about racist crew on Air France and felt we encounter one such person and decided to just keep low. 

However the next leg of the journey was pleasant with the crew being polite and helping us the best they could. 

For the return journey crew was good but they reassigned our seats without any intimation. Our tickets confirmation mentioned seats I had reserved but when the gave me boarding pass it was different. They couldn‚Äôt change it back as the other seat was already assigned to someone else. Now the problem was we were traveling with a small kid.

Worst experience,Punta Cana,London,International,Family of six travelling with a young Grandson. First time ever flying with Air France and definitely the last. Flight was delayed to Paris so was a rush then my Daughter got stopped at Security in Paris when our connecting flight was boarding. Took a very unfriendly person a very long time to open the sealed duty free bag & check her toiletries purchase. We then had to run for the plane. Flight crew were very nice food awful. Coming home flight from Dominican was on time but still a mad rush for connecting flight at Paris. My husband was stopped and bag searched very slowly again by a very unfriendly person. Me and my family felt so stressed out that we would miss our connecting flight for London. The worst was yet to come as only 3 out of 6 of our cases landed at Heathrow. It was chaos with many travellers not receiving their luggage from the connecting flight. My case was delivered two days later & last night my Daughters cases were delivered but to the wrong addresses.My husband had to travel into London today  to retrieve and swap cases. I would never fly Air France again not even if someone offered to pay for our flights.

Unfavorable,Singapore,Paris,International,"Having flown premium economy on other airlines, I can say my experience with Air France was the least favorable. The seat was slightly larger but did not recline! Only the leg and foot rests were adjustable, not the seat itself which remained upright for the entire 15 hour flight. Not being able to adjust the angle of the seat for a flight that length was truly painful. I flew back I plan economy, and was more comfortable.

One of the worst,Istanbul,Detroit,International,"I have been flying to and from DTW to IST a couple times every year. Delta is our main carrier in DTW. Unfortunately when Delta  cancelled the direct flights to Istanbul , we had to make a stop in either AMS or CDG because of the partnership. I have been trying to find a flight with KLM stopping in Amsterdam, but it is not possible every time.  AF is the only airline I fly without entertainment in flight from Paris to Istanbul. Several times we couldn't get our luggage in Istanbul, because it was not on the plane. They arrived a couple days later. It is kind of accepted fact that your luggage likely will not come on time if you fly with AF. Food is always very average. At my last flight they did not even bother to show safety measures, and did not pick the trash at the end of flight. 
What can I say about CDG. HORRIBLE , HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE. Even if you look at their website you will be lost. Signs says nothing. Connections are a nightmare. You have to pass security again and again. Trains are operating outside the security, if you would like to lounges, you have go outside, pass the security again. If you ask somebody your way, good luck. They are mostly rude not helpful.

Delayed our flight by 7 hours and then flight cancelled. Left to ourselves with no help.,Manchester,Paris,Europe,"Delayed our flight by 7 hours and then forced us to stay on the plane. Gave us no explanation, lead us on saying the flight will leave and only gave us refreshments until the end. Very disorganised company and very disappointed with the service I received. You‚Äôd think surely they would have the decency to give us the money back that we had to pay for transport and Hotel. They didn‚Äôt, instead they offered to pay a little amount compared to the costs and stress we endured due to Airfrance‚Äôs disorganisation. Forced us to stay in a tight cramped space with other people and crying babies for over 7 hours and were just left to sort ourselves out with a hotel late at night on THE NIGHT with no help. Very unhelpful and very upset with Airfrance. Will never be flying with them ever again. If the flight was cancelled, we should have been told in advance NOT ON THE AIRPLANE WITH A DELAY OF 7 HOURS! But they didn‚Äôt. They‚Äôre not even offering us the full compensation for the LEAST amount of costs we had to endure due to Airfrance‚Äôs disorganisation and indecisiveness. They ruined the rest of our holiday and I don‚Äôt want other people to make the same mistake.

Please avoid Airfrance. Awful company with no understanding from the customer‚Äôs end. You can fly with cheaper brands like Ryanair and Jet2 for better value for your money. They‚Äôll make you pay more for no reason",2022-12,2022-12-20,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
Discrimination Against Disabled (& English!) Passenger(s),Male,Newcastle upon Tyne,International,"Where to begin in this catalogue of disasters?! First up - I am disabled, visibly disabled, with crutches, requiring assistance. I booked special assistance throughout the entire journey, yet the only airport organised and ready to support me with the relevant equipment to hand was the smallest, Male.

I upgraded our flight to business from Paris to Male, and upon check-in at the lounge we were made to feel as though we did not belong. Repeatedly being asked if we had booked business tickets, and insisting on seeing our tickets.

Our brand new purchased suitcases arrived in Male significantly damaged, to the point of no repair. This is the first and only time we‚Äôll be able to use both suitcases, which were brand newly purchased especially for our trip.

Treatment by cabin crew on the return flight from male to Paris was appalling. Upon boarding the aircraft I asked whether there were any payable upgrades available in business or premium. We were ‚Äòshooed‚Äô onto the aircraft and abruptly shouted at by another crew member, whom we were not even speaking with, there were no upgrades available. I reiterated I was not looking for a free upgrade, I was quite happy to pay and the reason for wanting to upgrade was medical. Again, we were met with hostility and hurried to our very cramped (and broken) seats.

I approached a seemingly friendly crew member to ask whether the flight was full, or if there might be alternative seats available, as the ones allocated were extremely cramped. Furthermore, my seat didn‚Äôt recline so as soon as the person in front out their seat back, the conditions were extremely uncomfortable.
I explained my reasons, again informed I‚Äôm happy to pay (just as I was on the outbound journey), the crew member told me the flight was full to Colombo and the crew would change there, however she‚Äôd pass this request on to the new crew.

I asked three times during the flight to Colombo if the crew could stow my walking crutches as I couldn‚Äôt even put my tray table down. My requests were ignored. I was left unable to put down my tray table and had to physically hold them for over 6 hours.

True to her word, I seen the friendly crew member who informed she‚Äôd pass on my request to the new crew, doing just this, and being sure to know the crew knew who I was, introduced me. However, for a fifth time again, as we departed Colombo (where we were delayed, meaning the flight back to Paris was fifteen hours), I asked the new crew about the possibility of changing seats or paying for an upgrade, and I was simply ignored, like a second class citizen.

I asked again if the crew could stow my walking crutches, so I could at least put my tray table down - I was completely ignored!!! Literally just walked past like I didn‚Äôt exist.
In the end, my wife got annoyed that I‚Äôd asked so many times and been ignored and she physically took my walking crutches to a crew member, handed them to her and asked for them to stowed for me.

Much to our absolute disbelief and disappointment, despite asking 5/6 times if we could either pay for an upgrade, or being moved to a more comfortable option in economy, that would be a more suitable option for my disability and medical needs, we were blatantly discriminated against as our polite requests were completely ignored, and 12-15 French passengers were proactively approached by crew around us and offered more favourable seating options, including upgrades!!! Is this really how you want to conduct business Air France? Outright discrimination against an English disabled passenger?! Favouring home grown passengers? I am nothing less than disgusted by this. This is especially terrible given I needed a more spacious seat for medical purposes, because I am disabled. I was left cramped, uncomfortable and in physical pain as a result of your crew ignoring my individual needs.

Furthermore, the crew as a general rule were very unattractive, unless of course, you were a French passenger. The rest of us more or less had to fend for ourselves. Water was offered twice in fifteen hours, and even then, it was half a cup - what good is this? otherwise passengers were forced to go to the back of the plane and help themselves to water. The crew call buttons were ignored if not a French passenger, I literally waited 40 minutes after pressing my button for a glass of water to take essential medication, whilst crew members passed my seat to see to another passenger‚Äôs needs of ‚Äòwine‚Äô. I will never fly with AirFrance again, I am disgusted and appalled to have been treated this way. At one point my wife went to the back of the plane to get me a drink (again for tablets), and because I needed sugar, she asked the crew for a cola. The crew member signed in her face and rolled her eyes! What kind of service is? Not the five star I expected, I wouldn‚Äôt even give it 1 star.

Discrimination against a disabled passenger, and discrimination and blatantly favouring French passengers over others?!

When the special assistance eventually bothered to show up at Paris, it was unfriendly and unwelcoming. The person who essentially ‚Äòhelped‚Äô me, talked negatively about me to her colleagues in French, completely unaware of course that I understood. It was a horrible unfriendly experience and has frankly put me off wanting to visit Paris altogether. She was on her mobile with one hand and pushing my wheelchair with the other, not paying attention, I felt unsafe.

The return flight from Paris to Newcastle was cancelled and the replacement was moved to the next day, requiring a stay overnight in Paris. This was changed quite some time back, however AirFrance informed I could claim this cost back, which I submitted via the required process upon return. Three weeks ago I received a remittance advice informing this would be credit to my bank account 02nd December, however the bank details listed are not my details! I have flagged this NINE times via Air France Customer Care, AirFrance WhatsApp Customer Support & have raised two cases with Resolver, and surprise surprise, no one from AirFrance is interested in helping, or have bothered to reply, nor do I have my refund! AirFrance WhatsApp?! More like ‚ÄòWhatAWasteofTime!‚Äô ‚Äì fobbing me off, won‚Äôt help because Customer Care need to handle, who can‚Äôt be bothered to even respond!

Terrible service!!!,Mexico City,Paris,International,"I contacted AirFrance by Messenger to request an aisle seat and I never got an answer to my request which was extremely important for me.

The app wouldnt allow me either to chose my seat even though I was willing to pay for the seat I wanted. I ended up getting the worse seat at the airport in the very back of the plane. I got to sit besides a guy that was constantly and phlegmly coughing right besides me.

There was another aisle seat empty and the cabin staff did not allow me to change seat, with NO EXPLANATION as to why.

Since the staff wouldnt allow me to take the other aisle seat I went back to my place. Some hours later and since this man wouldn't stop coughing I requested to be changed, this time, wherever. The flight attendant told me that it was no longer possible to change my seat since people were sleeping. I asked her to please change me or I would just stand the rest of the flight. She told me to then go look for a seat my self and wake up whoever was there so I could come in (middle seat).
I said NO and only then did she come and help me.

Midflight I ended up being changed to a middle seat which at this point was better than sitting besides a clearly and obviously sick person.

The service provided on board was terrible. This was the worse ever experience I have had in the 20 years i have been traveling. 

AirFrance accepted a clearly sick person in the flight and seated him besides me!! Imposible that they didn't notice this man was sick since he was coughing every 2 minutes! 

AirFrance never collected the PCR-test from me or from anybody else. This is NOT caring about the safety of their passengers.

I tested myself with a PCR-test before flying and it came up negative. I tested myself home after arriving and the test came up POSITIVE. Meaning I got Covid on the AirFrance flight from that sick man that AirFrance accepted on the plane and that they seated besides me.

Canceld and delayed flights without any notice.,Santo Domingo,Dubai,International,"Well my experience started in Dubai when I reached to the check-in desk and I was told that the flight was canceled and no one knew what was going on so I kept moving from a desk to another until they transfered me to a different terminal and provided me with different airline and different timing and I had to stay at the airport for 7.30 hours as I was not le to go back to abu Dhabi, I ended up flying Emirates which was very confort able and provided great services as usual. Landed in Madrid which I was not comfortable with as I did not know if they needed a transit visa, the flight from Madrid to Santo Domingo was hell as it was operated by some europairline I and. Not sure.

Hell was on the way back where I had 4 hours dri e from POP to Santo Domingo and the flight got delayed (what a surprise at least not canceled), when arrived to the airport of course you cannot pass the security gate as priority since you have a flight to catch buy the surprise was when I reached the gate the lady said that she has to change my flight as I cannot board anymore because I WAS LATE üòÇüòÇüòÇ.

I explained that it is the other way around thief flight was delayed and let me tell you she did not like it. I was transfered to the customer service who arranged another flight 10 hours later ( what you will be doing during those 3 hour is non of their business.

I ask for the name of the lady who was assisting me because she was super rude, unprofessional and I wanted you to know that you are putting some wrong people to assist your customers. But she refused üòÇüòÇüòÇ. Again I am not really sure what happened as the first rule in cs is to interducw yourself üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ.

Don‚Äôt fly except there‚Äôs absolutely no other option,Lagos,Ottawa,International,"AirFrance is the airline from hell. I flew them with my entire family in September. My husband, I and 3 kids. We had a stroller with us because the kids are all little and it‚Äôs hell travelling with little kids and no stroller (2 connecting flights). In Lagos, they told us we‚Äôll have to check in our stroller and get it back at our first stop over in France. We handed over the stroller to them. 

Several minutes later they came back to inform us that we‚Äôll only be able to get our stroller back at our final destination  in Ottawa. It was a terrible trip having to carry our hand luggage and kids and no stroller but we made it all the way down to Ottawa. Got all our luggage out but still no stroller in sight.

We got to Ottawa at night, airport looked deserted and with crying kids and tired parents there was no one to ask about the stroller. It took about 3 days to recover from this trip from hell, set up internet and then I made a report online asking about my stroller. When I made the report I got assigned a file number then there was absolutely no response from the airline for 3 whole months.

3 months later, long after we‚Äôve purchased a new stroller and moved on with our lives, the airline contacts us, claiming they want to reimburse us for the lost stroller. She asks for my details and I send her everything then she asks for a non existent reference number. I gave her the file number I was assigned when I made the complaint and she says I was supposed to have yet another reference number assigned when I made my complaint and since I didn‚Äôt have it she can‚Äôt do anything about my stroller.

This is the worst customer service I ever received in my life. Why wait 3 whole months to tell me this? I had already forgotten about your incompetence then you contact me three months after to remind me and annoy me once again.

Worst experience ever,Prague,Malaga,Europe,We just got into Paris from Prague and due to the late arrival of the plane in Prague we missed our connection to Malaga. This can happen. What cannot happen is the customer service at the Airport in Paris by Air France. Nobody I mean nobody was at the gate to guide customers to the help desk. We had to ask a security guard for directions. We walked from terminal 2F to terminal 2E and back. The shuttle bus was not to be found. The vouchers for the restaurants could not be used because everything was closed. The guy at the help desk was very very rude so was everyone else at Air France. I will take a flight back to Malaga tomorrow and if I can help it it will be my last flight because it is just no more fun.

Review for Air France airline,Amsterdam,Paris,Europe,"I do not recommend this air line. I book with KLM from LAX to Paris, KLM reserved from Amsterdam to Paris with Air France and told me they are same, but they are not. I paid for premium economy from Amsterdam to Paris 6 months ago. Air France cancelled the flight and don‚Äôt bother to tell me until I called them 3 months before flight and find out , then they said they don‚Äôt have seat avail in premium economy as I paid and they gave me cheaper seat and did not bother to give the difference back to me. 4 days before flight, I called again to confirm the seats that I got second time, they said those seats are not available and they gave me even worse seat, again didn‚Äôt bother to offer me to pay the difference that they charged me. I don‚Äôt recommend them and you have to watch them. It seems they are not honest and also if KLM offers segment of the trip with Air France, do not accept, Air France is not good air line to travel, take it from some one that travels very 4 months from USA to Europe. This was not my first time experience, I stopped using them long time ago but this time I listened to KLM rep. Do not travel with Air France until they bring their service to the quality of other good air lines like KLm or Birgin Atlantic or Lufthansa or even Turkish air line is much better than air France",2022-12,2022-12-09,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

Our 9 hours!! seating in Amsterdam for our next leg was ok, BUT they put us in an old 737 airplane dating back to the 60's . The seats were umconfortable as hell and we had paid for lie flats sears, imagine that? 
The service on KLM is far superior to Air France in Business Class, the return flight was in Business Class, and once again , we were stuck in a massive airport in Paris , without a decent Air France help for 2 senior with luggage. 
After our return to Canada, we requested compensation and after 30 days of waiting around, the final answer came back , sorry nothing we can do , you are not EU citizens so the compensation policy DOES NOT APPLY to you , as you are Canadian citizens.

Was at the information desk at 7.05 but was too late anyway. The lady said I was given enough time so they cant do anything. According to them 55 minutes is enough. Gate closed  at 6.52 so I actually had only 37 minutes to get to the other terminal and pass all check. My luggage was checked in to Amsterdam but AirFrance people said it was in CDG.

I hope I ll never have to fly with them again,Belgrade,Punta Cana,International,"This is the company I would never again fly with! So start from the begining.. We booked a trip from Belgrade to Punta Cana via Paris. First of all, when we came to Belgrade, they told us flight is overbooked and they wouldn‚Äôt let all passengers on board even though we all had reservations!!! We had to check in all luggage even cabin ones, when I told them about lost luggage problem in Paris airport and that all my stuff is in my cabin luggage, they told us we need to check in all of them even small ones because they dont have space! We were one hour late in taking off from Belgrade because staff  choose some random pasangers and didn‚Äôt let them board! 
Flight from Paris to Punta cana‚Äî another story!!! I checked in online and even though im flying blue member I got last and the worst seats! Of course I wanted to pay for priority seats or upgrade and I tried that online- didn‚Äôt work even though there were other seats avalible that time!  ‚ÄúTechnical problem- call the support..‚Äù Then, I  spent more than one hour talking to your manager via mobile phone and they told me I can upgrade on airport! I came to airport- they told me flight from Paris to Punta Cana is overbooked too!!!! I couldnt upgrade! Ok.. we waited, we got on plane one hour later than we should because everything was late!!!  Too many people!! On board- very unplesant staff!! They only served alcohol for 3 hours and our flight was more than 9 hours!! We wanted to pay- they didn‚Äôt give it to us! They said they only serve tea, coffee and Soft drinks!
Finally when we arrived they told us plane was late and we couldnt leave plane for 30 minutes! Also they didn‚Äôt get us water, didn‚Äôt let us go to toilet, Children were screaming‚Ä¶ very awful situation!!! We waited actually 60 minutes on Plane!!! 
 All that because gate was occupied- Because we didn‚Äôt arrive on time- (Like that was our fault! ) I had arranged transfer to my resort which I ofc didn‚Äôt make it on time..!!! OFC i had to pay for another transfer!!! Who is gonna make it up to me?! Obviously you wont!! This is embarassing and I will never fly with this company again!

Best flight of this European trip (7 total),Paris,Boston,International,"I am surprised by so many negative reviews. On this trip to Europe I endured seven flights on four different airlines. Air France was by far the best! Everything about them far surpassed the other experiences. I found all aspects favorable, though I did find downloading my boarding pass confusing. The crew was friendly and accommodating, the food was good and the security was easy and efficient.",2022-10,2022-11-27,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0
"Indifferent stewards, bad attitude.",Paris,Vancouver,International,"I've flown air france on 2 occasions. The Online registration is smooth, but change in flights from yyj to yvr screwed up my registration that caused boarding delays. 
In flight service, do I even need to comment? The first time I flew , the steward forgot to hand me the meal and then didn't even bother apologizing when I reminded him.
I decided to let it go... as such things do happen. A year later I flew again, and this other steward completely ignored me when offering drinks. This is the only airlines where the crew feel obligated to offer services, LIKE DUDE THAT IS YOUR JOB. I'm not spending thousands of dollars for this. 
The only reason I even use these airlines is because Canada has super limited choices for international travel. I'm skeptical about visiting France now given my first hand experience with these guys... one suggestion - BE NICE. It's  really not that hard",2022-11,2022-11-25,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
"Never Again! First trip to Paris ruined by Air France.
Avoid row 35 duo seats A&B",Paris,Miami,International,"I purchased premium economy tickets that indicated I could change my flight. When I tried to change my flights, I couldn't. A message it said I had to phone Air France. I called Seven times and spoke to seven different people. I emailed them and got No Response. On the seventh call I was able to change my flight for a fee of $373!!! And they switched my flight to economy instead of Premium Economy without telling me.

Then I had to pay another $80 to get a seat on the wing.

On my return flight I paid another $84 to move from the back of the plane to behind the wing. 

One of the members of the crew moved a paying customer out of the seats in from of me to accommodate their pass-riding staff ""so they could sit together"". One of them kept her seat reclined the entire 10 hour flight even for meals. Some of the crew catered to them in excess. When I asked if the she could moved her seat up just a little, she moved it back even further. I complained to one of the crew members and was told she was causing problems in the back and that's why she was moved there. I complained to to supervisor about what was happening and she said the passenger could keep her seat reclined and looked annoyed at me. 
I was crunched between the wall behind me and the reclined seat in front of my face. She did nothing about it.
What a miserable flight!

By the way, there were Very Few US Citizens exiting customs on that flight. No wonder why!!!!",2022-11,2022-11-25,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
Air France LOST MY PASSPORT at the boarding gate IN FRANCE,Paris,Chicago,International,"At the boarding gate for flight DL 8494, I scanned my passport, and there was a notification to see the gate agent. I was told that I had been selected for a random explosive screening along with several other passengers. The gate agent took my passport and handed it to an Air France employee who told me to follow her. This was the last time I saw my passport. My belongings were searched, and a brief explosives screening was performed. When it came time to return the passport to me, they told me they could not find it. After 30 minutes of processing other passengers and accusing me several times of losing it (even though I was already behind the boarding gate and they were the last ones to have it), a few employees began to search for it frantically. 

Not once did anyone apologize, reassure me they would sort the issue out, or reimburse me for MASSIVE inconvenience and cost. The staff was extremely rude and hostile, especially Leila Boutoukrine, manager r√©f√©rent de la culture client. The employee who was last seen with my passport was not even present to assist in the search. She disappeared after everyone was alerted that they had lost it. 

My wife and I emptied our backpacks and pockets three times to show them that we did not have my passport. I did not even have contact with my wife before the explosive search, and there was no possible way she had it, but we remained compliant. I requested they watch the security footage to show that the last time it was seen was in the hands of an Air France employee and recommend that your team do the same. I even had to suggest that they ask all the passengers on board to check if they had been given the wrong passport after being screened because the Air France team was completely mismanaging the situation, losing vital time in locating my passport and doing nothing to solve the problem they created.

Although the situation was a complete nightmare and made me have multiple panic attacks, my wife and I remained kind and cooperative. Not once did we raise our voices or treat the employees of Air France with disrespect, yet we were not given the same courtesy. 

Leila Boutoukrine spoke with the U.S. Air Marshall, who cleared me for travel. She handed me the phone to speak with him but rushed me off, taking her phone before I was done asking questions. I got to speak with him for only a few minutes during one of the most stressful moments of my life. Luckily,  I had a photo of my passport and a driver's license to prove my U.S. citizenship, or I would have been stranded in France indefinitely. Leila Boutoukrine never apologized or provided us with updates. She spoke in French every chance to ensure we could not understand what was happening, and she did not ever clarify. She walked away, never returning to the gate, and did not tell me what would happen next. She acted as if the entire ordeal was a huge inconvenience for her.
They delayed our original flight by over an hour and then still would not let us board, even though they lost my passport and the U.S. Air Marshal cleared me for travel. 

The only Air France employee to help us was Karine Alibaye. She worked tirelessly to get my wife and me on a flight to our originally intended destination, Chicago. Hours later, we boarded flight AF 378 to Detroit. At the boarding gate, Air France selected my wife, Emily Parker, for the explosives screening, and she was required to give Air France her passport. This was an incredibly unnerving experience considering everything that we had already gone through. Flight AF 378 was late, and we still had to manage to deal with customs and baggage claim. We spoke to border agents, who eventually granted me entry into the United States. As we proceeded to baggage claim, our connecting flight to Chicago, DL 2566, was boarding. On top of it all, our bags were not at baggage claim. So we obviously never had a chance at making that flight considering all of these circumstances. Even passengers aboard AF 378 with checked luggage and passports were concerned they would miss DL 2566. 

 At this point, we had already missed our most crucial commitment in Chicago, had no luggage for the unforeseeable future, and now had the daunting and inconvenient task of replacing my passport before our upcoming international travel to Mexico. We asked the Delta agent to send us to Atlanta, Georgia, so that we could begin the process of replacing my passport as soon as possible. 

Since Air France lost my passport and would not let us board our original flight (even though the plane had not left and our bags were on board), we never made it to Chicago for an important family event that took place on the evening of October 04, 2022, and we missed a week of commitments. This disaster caused us to cancel our entire trip. We had to cancel flights, lodging and missed events to which we had purchased tickets. 

This entire catastrophe caused by Air France continues to cost us time and money. I had to go through customs with no passport, our bags were lost, and we were without them for three days, and we missed the connecting flight to Chicago and had to wait for the next available flight to Atlanta, which was not for hours. What was supposed to be a 12-hour travel day ended up being 30+ hours of nonstop travel and hundreds of dollars on a new passport, administrative fees, and non-refundable commitments. Not to mention the HUGE amount of time I now have to invest in getting a new passport.  Lastly, we will need to postpone our upcoming trip to Mexico. Even with expedited shipping, I will be unable to receive it in time. 

Air France REFUSES TO COMPENSATE ME FOR FLIGHT, BAGGAGE FEES, PASSPORT FEES, MISSED TRAVEL COMMITMENTS, MISSED WORK, AND NONREFUNDABLE EXPENSES. Not to mention all of the time and energy this entire situation continues to demand. 

Not a single person has contacted us since this took place. We are very uncomfortable that the staff presumably either stole the passport themselves or handed it to a random person boarding the plane to Chicago. We have also requested that AirFrance check the camera footage on that gate in hopes that the passport can be tracked down, but they refuse to do so. It would be nice to have some reassurance that my security isn‚Äôt at risk, but they could care less.",2022-10,2022-11-23,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
For Gamblers Only,London,Seoul,International,"I never left a review for airlines, but Air France deserves one, because no one in their right mind should ever use their services.

I bought a return ticket LND-SEL. Two days before the outbound flight I got a notification that my flight was cancelled and that someone would be in touch. No one got in touch. I spent all day trying to get through to a human, as the useless online system obviously wouldnt let me rebook on my own. No matter the waste of time, at least I was able to get an alternative flight on the same day that would get me to my destination. 
However, I also got a notifcation that my return flight in December was ALSO CANCELLED and they put me on a flight on a different day. The new flight doesn't work with my schedule at all,  So I request a refund. Few days later I receive a refund of a laughable ¬£40 for my ¬£700 flight. 

I can put up with subpar service and uncomfortable seats for the right price, however, if an airline can't ensure their core service functions as advertised, they rly shouldn't be in the business. If I buy a ticket, I expect to fly on the dates and time I paid for, and not gamble for a ""close enough"" alternative. I have travelled all my life all over the world, this is the first time I came across an airline as unreliable as Air France.

Flight cancellation refund,Johannesburg,Newcastle upon Tyne,International,"Air France left me in Johannesburg at the boarding gate without any form of information or support in November 2021. This was due to South Africa being added on the Covid Red-List. They left us at the gate with no support or advice. I had to find somewhere to spend the night. I was stuck in Africa for a whole week and had to buy a new ticket with Ethiopian Airlines, who offer a better service by the way.

I filled in a refund form in December 2021 with all my expenses and receipts attached. They emailed me back about ten times asking for evidence of my expenses which I had already provided. Total expenses was over ¬£4000. They have offered me ¬£85.
¬£85 for all that I went through is a slap in the face.

I booked 2 round trips from Paris to Berlin for next Dec. and the website returned the wrong departure and return dates.

"Poor service, horrible food (had tummy issues for 4 days)",Mahebourg,Paris,International,"The ground staff did their very best to mess up things and make it as complicated as possible for travelers.  Or this is at least how it looked to me.  THREE hours of transit time weren't enough - the flight was delayed by over ONE full hour, simply because of messed-up procedures.  And then they had the nerve to chase my butt when I arrived at the gate, totally out of breath.
The service during the flight was poor, very poor.  I'm used to lack of service in this post-covid time, but honestly, getting a sour face when you ask for a glass of water ??
The food was horrible - simply inedible.  My grandmom had pigs, and what she served them was better than what I got.  The breakfast (except for the hot chocolate) was returned mostly untouched.  I had stommach issues for 4 days and it started a few hours after dinner.

Pay over ¬£3000 to get covid.,Manchester,Osaka,International,"My name is James Barton and I had the misfortune of being on your 1320 flight from Paris to Osaka. We are traveling to Japan specially to see my elderly Father in Law who suffers with a life inhibiting serious lung disease called COPD. I feel the safety and welfare not only for myself but my 3 year old son was completely disregarded by the entirely of your staff from the Captain all way down to the Air Stewardesses. Keeping in mind we are still in a pandemic and Japan has only just reopened its borders to foreign tourists imagine my shock apon arriving to my seat (20D) when I noticed a sick looking couple sat directly behind me, my wife and my 3 year old son. Less than a hour into the flight the couple started coughing and sneezing (my family were all wearing masks, this couple wasn't), obviously the air was dry and maybe that was a contributing factor. Then the coughing and sneezing got much worse. A quarter into the 13hour flight they complained about overheating and sweating profusely, this is when the male started stripping his clothes off to his under garments and taking temperature readings with a thermometer, this is all less than a 2 feet away from my son. He then called the steward who informed the safety member to see him. It is when I believe the couple asked him to talk to the captain (I don't speak French). The safety member then came back with a big tray of medicine for the couple and then blasted the Air conditioning above the couple to max which resulted in me, my wife and toddler having freezing cold air blown more or less directly on for the remaining half (roughly 6 hours) of the flight, they also had they lignts on during 'sleep' time when everyone else had theirs off and we couldn't put our seats back due to this couple being stretched out fully and coughing non stop (i could feel it on the back off my head). At the moment the couple were requested to wear masks which they did after about 6 hours. I took one of the Stewardesses to one side and explained how I wasn't happy with how the situation was being handled and would like more help regarding the safeguarding of my son. The air Stewardesses simply struggled, rolled her eyes and stated there's nothing she can do. I explained about seeing my Father in Law who is vulnerable and again the incredibly rude member of staff rolled her eyes and shrugged (she must have done that no less than 5 times throughout the conversation). The male part of the couple was much worse and about 3 quarters into the flight the man (who was stripped off still) had his wife wrap his head up in the provided blanket like a mummy as some sort of make swift quarantine. We went the entire 13hour flight after already being up from 3am without any sleep and I feel I spent nearly ¬£3000 on these tickets just for my family to be given a potentially deadly disease. On departure of the airplane I complained to the captain and Stewardesses who was seeing us off that I was incredibly unhappy. The captain said he was unaware of any medical incident which I don't believe. The captain also said that I should have complained earlier which I stated I did about 7 hours prior to no action. The captains said they will log an in-flight incident report which I would like to see. Also I was shocked to see the same passengers in KANSAI international Airport train station, they somehow made it through quarantine, doesn't the airline need to tell the quarantine staff that there was a passenger displaying severe covid symptoms on the plane? I think its disgusting that you put even more people at risk with these complete disregard for covid. We all tested negative last day we were home, now we are all coughing and intend to get tested as soon as possible. I know medical emergencies can't be helped but they should have never been let on the plane or at the very least the couple or ourselves moved. I hope you take this matter as seriously as I am and I await your reply. Also I am genuinely disgusted how the couple wasn't at least quarantined to be tested at the very least.

Excellent Airline,Manchester,Paris,Europe,"We have just used Air France we set off from Manchester 16/11/22 to Charles de Gaulle AF1269 6:00 and returned 19/11/22 AF1268 21:00.

Air France was an excellent experience from start to finish all the staff are friendly and helpful with free refreshments and cookies going and then free refreshments with sandwiches coming back. 

Charles de Gaulle airport is a super airport everywhere was clean and tidy with plenty of facilities... Even down to the free arcade machines for us to use whilst waiting and even a children's area which kept our little ones happy.

The checking in and luggage was all done with ease with plenty of security to keep everyone safe and we hardly waited which with 2 young children was great.

The best thing I thought was as we left the aircraft on both occasions the pilots were there to say goodbye and wished us well.

Thank you so much Air France for our great Disney experience we will definitely use your services again in the future.",2022-11,2022-11-19,5.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
Discrimination Against Less Abled,London,Singapore,International,The booking process with Air France is appalling! I need a carer to sit with me on flights to help with my eating and bathroom needs. I spoke to an Air France agent who told me if I want to ensure my carer is sat with me I would have to pay a fee! This was confirmed by several other calls. It is not just a want but a NEED to have someone with me as I am unable to do these tasks for myself. I have NEVER experienced this with another airline. Even budget airlines are very helpful when you contact them around a disability. I will NEVER be flying with this sham of an airline again. The planes are all old. They are falling apart.

Premium Economy Experience,Toronto,Johannesburg,International,"Efficient, pleasant and obliging cabin crew with no ""attitude"" as is common on many airlines. Seats were comfortable on the Airbus 350 but less so on the Boeing 777-300. Meals on both flights were only what was served to economy passengers, so this was a let down as the food was mediocre at best. Such a shame for the French airline considering the country's culinary expertise. No spirits were offered during the flight except cognac as an aperitif. I asked for gin and the attendant said there was none on the cart but he would get me one from business class. Very nice of him but very poor for a large airline like Air France considering all it's major competitors offer a full bar service.

Paid for business class and was denied access to business lounge,New York City,Tbilisi,International,"I flew business with AF (the flight was great, wonderful food as expected). I arrived at 5am and had a 7 hr layover at Charles De Gaulle. Because I was continuing to Tbilisi with AF, my next flight was in a different terminal than where there was a AF lounge. Not a problem, I had PLENTY of time so I went to the other terminal and they would not allow me to go to the lounge. I was flying alone so I couldn't even use the restroom without bringing my bags with me. I paid a lot for this ticket and I was really angry. I tried to contact AF customer service but by the time they could do anything it was time for my next flight. Even though there was 7 hours to transfer my bags, they lost them. So I had to go buy new clothes in Tbilisi until my luggage arrived just in time for me to leave. I flew from there to Amsterdam via Paris and again, my bags did not make it and I missed my flight because they only gave me 1 hr between flights which is impossible at CDG. Not a good experience. The flight with code AF was run by Georgian Airlines... which had placeholders for ashtrays the plane was so old.

Customer Service untrained properly,San Francisco,Venice,International,"I have not flown with Air France, but I am writing a review based on the customer service I have been provided.
First, their website for booking flight is, I must say, fair enough, compared to JUST FLY site.  I had to call Air France's Customer service just to make sure I would be getting a good deal.  Unfortunately that is not the case since, I have to be charged another for the return flight after selecting outbound flight.
As I was trying to book my flight, I had to make another call regarding information on passengers.  I made several calls, spoke to several agents and was given  different answers with the number of calls I made.  Just when I thought I has being serviced properly, This Customer service decided to transfer my call to a department that was already closed for the day.  Others just decided to hung up on me
Over all, their customer service sucks.
This will be my first time flying with Air France, and I can only pray it will be better than their Customer service I have experienced (I am mindful how others have already read bad reviews about the airline itself).",2022-06,2022-11-17,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
For the food - Air France or British Airways?,Montreal,Barcelona,International,"Last time I flew AF business class about 5 years ago, the food was a highlight.  This time, I can only wonder if I picked the wrong menu choice.

Nothing wrong with the duck breast appetizer.  Main courses were tenderloin, snapper and chicken stuffed with foie gras.

Don‚Äôt order the chicken.  It had the texture of ground meat, the foie was well hidden and the overall impression was not up to any business class standard, let alone from the national carrier of a country that prides itself on culinary quality.

The subsequent 2 hour flight featured a piece of no name fish barely thawed and flavourless.  The flight attendant didn‚Äôt even know what type of fish‚Ä¶

In the business class cabin of British Airways, the short haul meal was a very acceptable tandoori chicken, not even overcooked.  On the long haul flight, I chose the short ribs and was quite pleased with them.  The small meal, an hour before landing, was a barbequed chicken sandwich that was worth eating.

So, from the food perspective, I choose the British over the French national carrier.  Is the rest of the world this topsy turvey?",2022-11,2022-11-17,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.9329363835788156,5.0,3.0,3.0

Really poor and not customer oriented service,Budapest,Bangkok,International,"I've purchased 2 tickets back in 14th of June for a flight from Budapest to Bangkok on the 12th of November and Bangkok to Budapest on the 5th of December. In the meantime we got great news that my wife is expecting. So we attended the regular medical appointments where the doctor said that she is endangered and she cannot fly. He wrote a verification about her condition which I forwarded to Air France on the 10th of September (2 months before the flight) asking them to refund the tickets out of equity, fairness, reasonableness. First they answered that they have forwarded the request to management, but they have denied it. As we paid $2000 for the tickets I obviously didn't leave it that so I've asked what are the options here. First they answered that I can request a cash refund for some of the services which would add up to a total of $200 or I can request a voucher refund for the total amount. The voucher can only be used by the two of us, within 1 year of the issue. Flying with a less than a year old baby is not really an option. We have exchanged a couple of emails then the conclusion was that we're not even entitled to a voucher refund anymore. 
I'm asking, what kind of service is this...? Freaking RIDICULOUS!
So I waited perhaps the flight will be cancelled (1 in a 10.000 chance) as that was our only chance getting our money back, but that didn't happen until today so I went up to Air France's website and I've asked a voucher refund which I just got.

AF customer hotline is worst than a placebo, they offer you nothing other than frustrating you and making you feel helpless and despair.

Going round in circles not being listened to by' customer service' and we're supposed to fly in less than a week and still non the wiser as to whether we have a flight? Where my money is? Or am I going to have to rebook for twice the price for a fault that is not my own?

Created an account to share my horror story,Washington DC,Paris,International,"I don't leave reviews. It's not my thing. But I have to put this out online because Air France think they are above the law and above the minimum of customer service required. 

After cancelling two flights back to back we had to stay an additional night in Washington DC, booking a last minute hotel room at our cost. 

We arrived late to Paris by 2 days, missing our luggage so had to buy a bunch of toiletries etc. 

3 months on after chasing them multiple times I have given up trying to get my money back. The online agents direct you to the phone lines, the phone lines have you wait for 2 hours then drop off. 

If you get through to someone they direct you to the online claim form (mine has sat unreviewed for 3 months). 

They can't even do their legal minimum to reimburse me - how could I trust them to do the legal minimum maintainance on their aircraft or staff training.

Business Class Service Failure,Cancun,Paris,International,"What a disappointment of a company! If I could put 0 stars I would! 
First of all, as a travel agent in a big travel concierge company, I'll make sure, I'll spread the word around the travel industry regarding the business class experience that one of the passenger's received today on board!

Business passenger was humiliated on AirFrance today just because she asked for a glass of Prosecco. Unhappy stewardess - Lily Rosevel, gave the passenger a huge attitude as she was forced to walk 7 meters and look for that glass of prosecco. The passenger received her drink with the following remark: ""this is first and last prosecco you will get"". Which is a little strange for business class. 
Right after that, the passenger asked for a glass of water and after waiting for 40 minutes for it, she was forced to go and look for the stewardess in the kitchen to remind her she was still waiting for her water. After another 10 min, the stewardess finally got her half a glass. The passenger asked for more water and received not only the attitude but a letter that the French police will meet the passenger in Paris and that the staff won't serve her going forward. All passengers in business class were forbidden from talking to the passenger and she had to sit quietly on her sit scared and humiliated until the rest of the flight. 
What a shame! 
I would recommend everyone who wants to experience real business class treatment to avoid AirFrance and book with Emirates!",2022-10,2022-10-28,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

Asked them to vacate our seats and they decided to take the pillow and cover with them. Really quite rude. Luckily it was an overnight flight so didn't need to endure the students too much but this was in between the seats being lowered and raised numerous times, making it difficult to keep tray stable and use inbuilt TV. Food was not good, I tried to contact airline via online booking to order a vegan/non dairy meal (as with Delta whom had this facility), but was given a choice of pasta or chicken, took the pasta which had egg and cheese in it - a medical incident could have ensued had I not checked the ingredients.

The hotel tried calling Air France multiple times on both a mobile and fixed landline, but there was no answer. The connection at CDG was a nightmare, one hour is not enough to go from gates 2F to gates M. There was a lot of confusion, I had to run and even so I arrived almost last minute. After departure, the staff were professional, the entertainment system is good but the ground experience ruins the entire trip. CDG is like an airport from a third-world country, old infrastructure and grey decrepit buildings.

Worst airline ever,Antananarivo,Munich,International,"On our outbound flight our luggage was mit delivered with us (can happen). However, it was very complicated to get help from the customer service. It took us two days to receive a confirmation about how to get our luggage. On our flight back home, the original flight was delayed, so it was not safe that we would geht our connecting flight. So Air France rebooked us to a new (really bad) flight at the next day without our confirmation and without oportunities to choose other options. We were noticed 7 hours before original departure. They sent us a link in a very unserious e-mail, where we were supposed to get help, but the website of the link was not available. Also the customer service was unreachable via phone. At the airport the Air France staff told us to buy a new ticket. We complained about this, since we did not rebook ourselves. It took them around 4 hours (without communicating with us) until they gave us the confirmation, to take our original flight. 

Overall we have to say that things like delayed luggage or flights can happen. But the way the customer service of Air France handled the situation, was the worst service we have ever had!! 

Who would have thought that Air France would be the worst transport company (Tsaradia Air, Cotisse Bus, El Condor) on our three weeks journey through Madasgacar.

When we began our descent into Paris, I did ask the Purser I see you checking your Ipad before you decide to greet or welcome anyone in Business Class. He was embarrassed and  said yes I start with our highest priority Air France Customer and work my way down. Often times I do not have time to greet and thank everyone on the list. I said its a pity the flight is only 10 hours long possibly he would have had time to at least say hi.
The meal service is so so
on the second flight from Paris to LAX I spoke with the purser and said thank you for saying hi. I would like to share with you that you and your team are as great as the last flight was poor. They did such a great job.

On one of the biggest International Airports in Europe! After a delay of 6 hours we finally arrived in Hamburg, where we recognized that all our 5 Baggage pieces went missing. We immediately made an AHL Report and headed to our Vacation home without any clothes. We made necessity purchases over the 17 day vacation because our baggage still was nowhere to be found. I made a Claim on the Air France Website for those necessity purchases on day 14 of the vacation. After 21 days I made a claim for lost baggage because the baggage still hasn‚Äôt arrived. After 28 days 3 of 5 baggages arrived at our home. The remaining 2 haven‚Äôt arrived now for over 3 months.
The customer Support took forever to just answer and asking simple questions about data that already has been send over and hasn‚Äôt payed any compensation yet. They also write mails in which they said you have been on a totally wrong flight on a wrong date. For example they wrote we have been on a flight from Paris to Havanna on October 11. Somehow they even closed the claim for the missing baggage although 2 pieces are still missing and on the date of the claim 3 pieces have been already missing for over 21 days. Their Website states that after 21 days you‚Äôre baggage is supposed to be lost and you are qualified for a compensation.

Anti-Child Stroller Policy and Inflight racist experience (Bad service),Mumbai,Atlanta,International,"I have never had a cause to write a scathing letter to an airline until this one. That‚Äôs not to say that things haven‚Äôt gone wrong on my travels over years but this was a hurtful and stressful experience unlike others. This post is longer than I would like it to be but I had to document this one on social media.

11 Oct 2022 @ ~11.00 PM ‚Äì BOM airport, Mumbai, India
This is my recount of a very frustrating, inconsiderate and a discriminatory travel experience that I had with #airfrance along with my 2-year-old toddler from Mumbai, India to Atlanta, USA with a 5.5 hour layover at Paris (CDG). It all started at the check-in counter in Mumbai where I was told that Air France  now has a change in policy requiring strollers to be gate checked but only to be handed back at baggage claim once we reached our final destination in the USA. I continued to remind them that I was travelling alone with a toddler and had no friend or family to assist through transit and security checks at Paris or through final immigration at Atlanta, USA. This whole process would be time consuming and incredibly stressful to manage without a stroller. To which I was assured that there would be a temporary child stroller available for transit at Paris airport. However, they had no answer to how one would manage through the immigration check and a walk to baggage claim at the final destination i.e. Atlanta, USA. At this point I realized that it was futile to reason or argue beyond this and began proceeding towards security check.

12 Oct 2022 @ ~8.10 AM ‚Äì CDG Airport, Paris, France
Once we landed at Paris there were no strollers in sight or staff members available to assist me in the right direction to secure one. I walked around and found a staff member who told me that a stroller would only be available once we were at the connecting terminal. Unfortunately, it defied the purpose and meant that I would have to figure out a way to manage my toddler and luggage through walks, escalators, elevators, a train ride and security check between terminals. This became way more than a mere inconvenience and a frustrating experience for a parent as I began my 30 min transit onward to the connecting terminal. What really irked me is that no thought had been given to child safety with this policy change - a deal breaker. I had a child to carry, hand hold or reign in along with a laptop bag, a diaper bag and a hand bag on me. Although my child enjoyed the multiple escalator/ elevator rides and a train ride to get to the connecting terminal, I was concerned about her safety all along as she wouldn‚Äôt let me hand hold her at all times and simply ran off. This meant having to chase her down from time to time. You don‚Äôt want children tripping and falling on escalators or in trains and getting hurt. As we finally made it to the connecting terminal (unhurt), I was clueless on how to manage her for the next 5 hours if she wanted to nap, rest or if I needed bathroom breaks. I went to a few gates looking for strollers only to be helped by a French speaking airport staff of South Asian descent. She was the only one who seemed willing to help and somehow found me a temporary child stroller that I could keep for the last 2 hours of my lay-over, which was a huge relief. Let‚Äôs leave aside the fact that the stroller was not in a good shape and hard to maneuver with worn out wheels (but this was way more than ok for me at this point). It took some convincing to get my child to sit on a stroller that she wasn‚Äôt accustomed to. My experience here may not matter to most people but an airline ought to have safe, child friendly and a positive customer experience mindset as their guiding principles for any policy design and #airfrance has failed at this. Which airline comes up with such ridiculous and poorly thought through policies? Every other airport and airline I have flown with has allowed us to gate check strollers only to be handed back (AT THE GATE) upon landing. So this was unheard of to begin with. In hind sight may be I should have asked for wheelchair assistance but that is besides the point. Now, moving on to my inflight experience.

Inflight experience AF 217, 12 Oct 2022 (Seat nos 43K and 43L)
I would like to highlight an insensitive and a discriminatory behavior by a couple female attendants on board this flight during meal service. My child was served a breakfast with eggs and sausage to which I politely requested the attendants if they could simply switch it out for a vegetarian option as it was available. Somehow, I was given a choice to pick a vegetarian breakfast but my child couldn‚Äôt have the same option. The response I was met with is what made this whole experience bitter, discriminatory and insensitive to a different cultural system and dietary preference. The flight attendant (a blonde ‚Äì don‚Äôt know her name) yelled back at me (yes, she was very loud and visibly angry) saying it was only an omelet, just an egg and my child could eat it. She repeated this a couple times. I asked her again if it was possible for her to simply switch it out for a vegetarian option ‚Äì the same meal as mine, to which she finally just shrugged her shoulders and moved on to the next passenger, leaving me confused and insulted as a person and a customer. I honestly don‚Äôt believe she would have met a French national, a US national or for that matter any other white skinned person with a similar response mechanism. I have a pretty high tolerance level and understand that not all customer requirements can be met but she could have at least obliged to check back on any extras left after serving other customers. There comes a point where enough is enough and this was one. Thankfully I had enough food on my plate to share with my toddler.

Inflight experience AF 688, 12 Oct 2022 (Seat nos 21K and 21L)
To my shock I was met with a similar experience on my connecting flight from Paris to Atlanta as well. My child was served a chicken meal and I requested for it to be switched to a vegetarian option to which the French flight attendant simply said ‚ÄúNo, it is not possible‚Äù and moved on. There was no explanation whatsoever. I was served pasta, which was vegetarian and that‚Äôs all I asked for. What bothered me is the arrogance and the lack of sensitivity the French seemed to have. Of course, they didn‚Äôt care if my child went hungry for hours. My child‚Äôs meal was untouched and I returned it back to the flight attendants which they were happy to take.

Atlanta, USA
After a 23+ hours journey, my child was too exhausted to wait in line at immigration at Atlanta, USA and literally laid on the floor through waiting lines. I was exhausted to hold her as well and physically couldn't with the luggage. Had to nudge her to keep walking and it took us over 50 minutes to get through immigration. She could have happily napped in her stroller if it weren't for #airfrance's change in policy.

Formally lodging a complaint with Air France for all the un-necessary stress and anxiety they have caused. I want them to acknowledge that their actions were appalling, racially discriminating and they would have to figure out a way to treat all their customers the right way and have sensible airline policies in place. Either what they say about French attitude is after all right or the attendants were just having a bad work day!

A word of caution to all parents ‚Äì Air France policies are not child friendly and I would urge all parents to think twice before booking Air France. I flew KLM on my way from USA to India and had a great experience with the Dutch.

My money wont go to this French airline going forward. Racism is not in my books and I take this one seriously.

Wifi quality must be improved,Tokyo,Marseille,International,"Flying eastbound instead of westbound avoiding flying over Russia took longer but flight itself was fine. French crews (or western crews) weren‚Äôt wearing masks but Japanese crews were wearing the mask from Haneda to CDG. I thought this was funny. Even though it is still mandatory to wear masks in Japan, once you are in the aircraft, most people took off masks. We‚Äôre ok as long as following the guidelines from airlines so I don‚Äôt know why Japanese crews kept wearing. But it‚Äôs good!

Airfrance/Delta Baggage issues,Detroit,Naples,International,"Airfrance/Delta lost my luggage 50+ days ago.  I have not heard a word about it or on my claims.  Their customer service center is a call center in the Cech Republic and not one bit useful.  There are 17,000 missing pieces of luggage in London, Amsterdam, and Paris and mine is probably one of them!
I will never deal with them after all this is over.  I am just one of many whom they have ruined a long awaited vacation and now I am still spending countless hours trying to get made whole again.
Delta canceled my original flight and then put my luggage on a flight I was never on through a totally different city.

"Denied boarding due to some inexplainable  issue, have not received the promised refund",Warsaw,Dallas,International,"Bought a ticket for my son (a minor) in May 2022, with assistance, flight with AirFrance from Warsaw, transfer in Paris and destination Dallas. Flight 28th June  6 am, we were at the airport since early hours, and when checking in, my son was denied boarding due to some issue that the attendant could not solve. He was the only one denied boarding, all other minors passed check-in and where picked up by the flight attendant, he was left behind. You can imagine the stress and distress :(
On top of that I was not provided with any viable explanation on why this took place, and a day later I was informed by AirFrance that they can't offer another flight for my son, and that they will return the money.
I had to buy my son another ticket with another airline and replan the dates and summer vacations all over. Air France told me that they have 90 days from the flight date to return the money. On the 90 day term end I contacted them via email (phone doesn't work, or you need to have time like 4-5 hours to hang in there), to understand when they finally give me back my money it was over 1500EUR that we're talking about here, was told in reply that I need to be patient ! now we are almost mid October, and nothing has arrived at my bank account yet.

I got to the gate when the door was about to close, huffing, puffing not even able to speak. I was greeted by a rude gate attendant who chastised me for my bag being too wide ( it fit in the overhead on the flight over) 
To make the flight worse - received a small glass of water 1 hour in. Then at 91/1 hours a small snack pack with a miniroll with melted cheese and a liquid yogurt. It was disgusting.

The CDA has no flight status boards that I could find. Boarding was a nightmare. They called for boarding @5:55 PM we waited in queue for 45 minutes waiting for the plane to be cleaned. Why start the boarding process! Airline staff clearly was asking who was French or spoke French and was giving preferential treatment. The plane looked like they pulled it out of mothballs from 1960. Tiny seat, no legroom at all and packed to the gills. Even though the flight was mostly US citizens, all the announcements were in French or garbled inaudible English. Everything was done as slowly as possible. 20 minute to leave the gate, 25 minutes to find a gate in JFK. Bags never came out.

Potential flyers beware,Los Angeles,Paris,International,"I will try and be brief. I flew from Los Angeles to  Paris business class. We arrive at CDG and our bags did not arrive. I went Air France baggage service and they told me I would have them delivered to my hotel the next day. 2 days later no bags and no word from Air France (as they has promised). I decided to go to CDG (reluctantly as very little could be done by phone or website (despite what they tout as ways to fix the issue).  Once there 
 I found out 3 bags had been sent to my hotel and should be there now. and speaking with their baggage recovery staff I was assured that they had my 4th bag and would send it to my Paris hotel. Now, keep in mind that while they said they had my bag, having been continually misled up until now I asked where my bag was. Well they said they don't really know, so at that point I said sounds to me like it is lost the. No they said they had it  and would deliver it to my hotel. Well it has been a week and I have no bag and have 
Not t been contacted by Air France on any level. In summary,  they have been lying to me since I arrived and given I really needed every thing I had in that bag including prescriptions, it has been beyond inconvenient. I will never fly Air France again (and I fly international a lot), while the inflight service was very good, their handling of my baggage was inexcusable. As it works out, while telling the hotel in Paris about my problem they said that is the norm for Air France and they constantly hear of similar stories from many of their clients. I can afford to have a marginal flight, but not arrive in a foreign country without my luggage only to find out 9 days later that the airline lost my luggage.",2022-09,2022-10-07,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0

Disastrous travel on air france,Johannesburg,Paris,International,"This air line should be so ashamed of themselves

1.	On my first leg to CDG the centre of the split between two passengers on business class was broken.
2.	I had to wipe down my chair and sides due to cleanliness , this was not up to standard
3.	The service while eating is terrible as you wait for ages to get a drink .
4.	The food was a 5/10 which is fair

On my return CDG TO JHB

1.	The WIFI WAS NOT WORKING CORRECTLY AND TO GET A AIR HOSTESS TO ASSIST WAS A MISSION
2.	The food was beyond edible, the salad was firstly off, when I complained the air hostess didn‚Äôt understand me as well as the next two that come to see, the fillet was not available , then I said chicken , this looked totally off , I would not have served that to an animal . I eventually has vegetarian which I hardly ate .  What surprises me is that they listed a list of languages spoken yet they all act stupid to my complaint .
This on a business class seat is totally unacceptable costing EURO 3941.00

Lost baggage,Manchester,Paris,Europe,"The flight was fine, only an hour and a half and got a free sandwich and drink. The problem was when we landed in paris and waited an hour for our baggage which never turned up. We had a train to catch which had already been pre-booked so we only had an hour left to get accross the airport and find the platform. We told the staff at the air france desk and they said the luggage is still in manchester and was never put on the plane. We had to fill out a claims form and give the address of the hotel to forward the luggage on too but we were only going for 4 days to disneyland paris. The woman said we could buy clothes and essentials and then claim the money back but keep all the receipts. We then had to leg it accross the airport and nearly missed our train which was very stressful.
4 days later and the case still hadn't arrived and we have now come home to manchester for them to email us and say its arrived at the hotel in disneyland. We told them on the form the date we were leaving. So we have now had to create a new baggage claim to get it back home. I doubt we will ever see our case and belongings again and will have to claim on our insurance. More time and stress!
So we have now added up all the costs of buying new clothes, essentials etc. and came to 375euros as we were in disneyland and we could only buy overpriced disney clothes and Airfrance have now said they will only cover the cost of up to 200 euros for a family of 3. Disgusting. The fact that weve wasted time shopping instead of spending time in the disney park on rides and that weve paid ¬£90 for the luggage that they havent reimbursed us either is very poor service.

Old tactic: Air France will not address your claim until you give up,Montpellier,Montreal,International,"On September 20 and 21, 2022, I had the same experience as many have reported, but in one single trip: Air France flight delay causing missed connection in Paris, rebooking on next day flight, no shuttle bus to hotel contrary to what was printed on the voucher, Duo seats paid for ($106.00) not provided, special meals not provided, wrong information or outright lies from AF personnel, busted suitcase. Two claims filed and so far, radio silence. I should also mention that my initial reservation, entirely paid for, was cancelled by Air France because a ""computer update of the reservation system"". Good thing I happen to check the status of my trip before leaving home. Just like all travellers who had the same experience, this airline will come up with lies, put the blames on someone else or simply do not abide by the regulations, just to delay or deny the reimbursement you deserve. You can't beat the old technique of not addressing justified client claims for reimbursement of expenses incurred as a result of company mismanagement, carelessness or maybe wilful attempt to spoliate the travelling public.

Avoid Air France Or You'll Be Sorry,Washington DC,Paris,International,"Air France used to be a great airline, that is no longer the case.

This past June my family and I flew Delta from Dulles to Paris. Since Delta and Air France have an ""alliance,"" The return flight from Charles De Gaulle Airport was with Air France.

The trouble started the night before our departure from Paris when less than 12 hours before our flight was to leave they suddenly cancelled the flight, sending us into a frenzy trying to find another return flight. We eventually did, but were given awful seats on a sold-out flight, making the 8-hour flight miserable.

Upon arriving at Dulles we were told that two of our three bags were left behind in Charles De Gaulle. The Air France representative assured us both bags would be returned within two days. That was a lie.

It took the airline more than three weeks to return my wife's bag, despite our providing them with its exact location in Charles De Gaulle, thanks to the Apple Air Tag we placed in it when packing. She was very inconvenienced those three weeks since all her good clothing, make-up and other essentials were sitting in CDG.

She was the lucky one.

It has now been three months and my suitcase sits exactly in the same location it was when Air France lost it July 1. I have sent them the Air Tag photo of it in CDG, made more than half a dozen phone calls to their so-called claims department, and sent more than a dozen emails, yet have gotten nowhere. They have done nothing whatsoever to returm my suitcase. It still sits at the exact same location in CDG. (I check my Air Tag locator daily, hoping for a change.)

Worse, after three-weeks I was entitled to file a lost baggage claim for reimbursement. Air France has never acknowledged the claim, much less reimbursed me. Clearly, the airline hasn't the staff to handle this situation, and, worse, is completely indifferent to my situation. They've lost more than $2,000 of my belongings and have done nothing to compensate me. The are currently in violation of the EU Montreal Convention which requires them to reimburse a customer for lost baggage.

A representative from Delta did eventually contact me to try to help. He got nowhere too, confiding in me that Air France is awful. He explained how lazy and inefficient their operations people are, and I should expect the worst from them.

Granted, air travel post-pandemic is awful with all airlines cancelling flights and delaying baggage, but Air France takes the prize. They simply don't care.

My advice is avoid them if at all possible.

Additional advice: Avoid Generali Global Assistance Travel insurance! The company is a scam. I filed a claim with them three months ago, and guess what...nothing. No reimbursement, no updates, no answered emails. I am now filing a complaint against them with the Department of Transportation.
See my full review of Generali elsewhere on TripAdvisor.",2022-06,2022-09-19,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0

‚ÄúI VISITED THIS PLACE‚Äù‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶ because I turn to Air France as one of my top line preferences of carriers. I was not disappointed- everything went smoothly and as expected for air travel in this era. 

Our flight to CDG from JFK was delayed- no fault of the airline- so an Air France representative met all of us who were continuing to TLV at the gate and escorted us through the maze of a second security inspection and boarding this flight- unpleasant but done in a good way. 

Also- the pilot aborted the landing when we were no more than a few meters from the ground (we witnessed it on the screens, and I was video recording until that very moment), and we circled for eight minutes more before landing- all of a sudden, everyone- and I do mean everyone- on the plane started engaging in small irrlevant  talk (except of course for Mrs. Place and me). We never knew why that happened.

WE were going on vacation so had no time constraints, and as Lufthansa were on strike thought this was a safe bet. We booked our flights, paid to upgrade and left on our Hollibobs :-)  The flight from DUS to CDG was uneventful and seemed to go quite smoothly, we transferred onto our Punta Cana flight, boarded and prepared for an 8 hour flight to our holiday destination. Unfortunately the screen for my entertainment system did not work but the stewardess worked tirelessly to resolve this unfortunate situation. We took off flew to Punta Cana , the service onboard was not exactly welcoming but we didn't really care. We returned to the Airport in Punta Cana for our flight back home and had a few challenges at the desk whilst booking in bit that is not Air Frances fault. My wife was not feeling too well and decided to sleep, which is normally the best thing to do. When the meal was served she was still sleeping and I did what I normally do in such cases and asked if she could get her food later, to which I received a very stern - NO - they had better things to do than serve meals later in the flight. Luckily we had bought some sandwiches at the airport so my wife had at least something to eat. Getting something to drink on this 8.5 hour flight was almost impossible, the staff were not very accommodating even though they did not seem to be run off of their feet. Breakfast was served, only one chance to get a coffee, the second time they came it was just orange juice and water, and then we happily left this flight.  Would I book with Air France again.... not on your Nelly ;-)",2022-09,2022-09-15,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0
Why on Earth would someone book a ticket with Air France,Newcastle upon Tyne,New Delhi,International,"Funny that there is a question below which asks ""When did you travel?"" . It is missing an option ""Not allowed to board"". 

When a booking is confirmed the least a passenger can expect is a suprise at the time of check in of not having a transit visa. 

I am not a resident of EU and neither am aware of rules which the local public might be aware of, so when I reached the airport (at 4 AM) and was not allowed to board because I did not have a transit visa, I asked the lady at the counter how will I know if I need to get a transit visa or not as nothing was mentioned on my flight booking or on the e-Ticket I received. I have travelled through EU many times i the past but this was my first time from CDG.

The lady kept on insisting that it is the duty if the passenger to find if visa is required or not (there is no change in terminal at CDG and I am not leaving the international space of the airport).

On checking with customer service they are asking me to pay the difference equal to the business class ticket but will be booked in Economy.

I think a certain responsibility should also fall on the airlines to atleast put a note on the booking saying ""You might need a visa at CDG airport even though you are not stepping into the French territory."" I hope DGCA takes some action some time in the future.

Service and luggage,Paris,Turin,Europe,"I flew from Toronto to Paris then from Paris to Turin. The 2 suitcases I checked in did not arrive in Turin and arrived one week later at my house. Air France had sent a message to let me know that the luggage had arrived the following day in Turin but the airline company seems to have a contract with a private courier service that doesn't care. I wasted precious time on the phone for 2 days trying to get hold of somebody. One week after the suitcases arrived at my doorstep with a huge tear in the large suitcase that I had to throw away after I unpacked. Fortunately nothing was stolen from it. 
The overall issue is that service is poor. The passenger is a number and not a person. Food was horrible. I used to travel with Air France 30 years ago and the food and service was excellent. Now it is all low grade.

When I insisted, he then said that all managers were in a meeting, and he refused to get a manager to call me back - he said I would have to ring again and try to catch them when they're available!

Fantastic Airline!!!,Dublin,Paris,Europe,"We flew with Air France on the 30th of August and the 2nd of September. I used the app to check in and found it very easy to use. The online check in through the app was super easy and our boarding passes were available immediately. I could also save the boarding passes to my Google Wallet which I found extremely useful. 

I had some issues with the app when I was trying to obtain the boarding passes for our return flights and needed to use the online chat service. 5 stars to that also. Starts off with a bot and then straight to an agent when they couldn't help. 

The airplanes were absolutely gorgeous. Spotlessly clean. So light and airy. The leg room was so much better than any other airline. It didn't feel cramped at all. I am a very nervous flyer and it is honestly the first time, in my life, I had absolutely no anxiety what so ever! The staff were so nice and friendly. Very attentive and even noticed the flyers who were sleeping when the food cart went by had missed their food and offered it to them when they awoke. The flights were on time. Smooth flight on the way over and back. Will definitely fly with this airline again when we return to France in the future.

"Utter incompetence: incapable of admitting an error in their system, which caused our ticket to be on the wrong date",Edinburgh,Paris,Europe,"The 11th of June I made a reservation for a flight from Edinburgh to Paris CDG. First thing first, their website is extremely unstable, and regularly page load fails with random ""Access denied"" errors, so despite being French I ended up in the UK website to make my reservation. Made my reservation and went to payment, all succeded. Except the date was wrong, 12th of August instead of 11th. Since I wanted to have the places at this rate, I did all the process once again, back on the french website, and it seemed to work. Then I went to ""my reservations"", and cancelled the 12th flight.

A few minutes later, I received a mail from Air France, with all the details for the 12th. Damn! So I contacted the hotline, and I talked to a very kind person who validated  the reservation for the 11th was confirmed, and sent me details over email. She said the reservation for the 12th might take a while before being cancelled.

This person failure to understand the situation cost me 660‚Ç¨ + 112‚Ç¨ of hotel + unrequired exhaustion and stress.

The day before departure, I checked my reservation online. The reservation number couldn't be found, but my reservation for the 12th was still active. What probably happened is that Air France information system is so unreliable, that they likely use an amount and card number to cancel a reservation, so they cancelled the latter reservation (from the 11th) instead of the 12th.

The day of the departure, I contacted the hotline as soon as I was able to. I hadn't figured out all that had happened but I new I had had a confirmation from the hotline that my reservation was OK. I tried to explain all of this to the agent, which refused to recognize the system might have made an error. She offered that we pay 1200‚Ç¨ to have an alternative flight the same day passing by the Netherlands. Not only she was incapable of helping me, but she failed to notice this ticket was voucher-refundable. Hopefully I checked the conditions attached to the ticket after talking to her and asked promptly for a refund to the Twiter team.

Amazing crew,New York City,Bengaluru,International,"I must say that I am impressed by the Air France flight crew.  I recently flew from NY to Bangalore with a connection in Paris with my wife and 12 month old son.  I know what your saying and I must say.  It was exactly what you would expect it to be.  A nightmare!  We had everything planned (my wife did I just follow orders) from the flight time, connection, food, sleep etc so that our child could have as smooth as a trip as possible.  From NY to Paris we we golden.  Smooth as silk.  We took off he ate and slept.  We landed and had some trouble figuring things out but we managed.  Once we got on the plane for our Paris to Bangalore slight the nightmare began.   
He started screaming at the top of his lungs before the flight took off.  Our plan for entertainment was lost during transport (ipad with pre downloaded 5hrs Cocomelon).  He was rejecting all toys and foods.  The lady behind us asked my wife "" Is he going to be like that the whole flight?""  After some back and forth with the other passenger, ourselves and the flight crew we took off.  It was a 10hr flight and he cried for 9 of them.  It was an out of body experience.  Our son has never been so miserable.  I dont know if it was sleep deprivation or his ears were bothering him but he was inconsolable.  Our friend behind us, to her credit, along with the other passengers did not add fuel to the fire.  
  The only bright spot was the flight crew.  Which is the reason for the review.  I have to give credit where credit is due.  They were simply amazing.    Very empathetic and supportive.  Asking us if we needed any support on multiple occasions and it wasnt just one of them it was all of them. Providing us with food and supplies that I didn't even know was available.  BTW did you know that there are children's eye covers?  I found that interesting and dont know why.  Anyway if it wasn't for our air heroes my wife and I would be needing immediate psychiatric therapy. We all know how difficult that is to get now and days.
My salute to the air crew that day.  You saved us and we are truly grateful.  We will remember this day for a long time not only because of the difficulties we had with our son but for the care and help we received from the crew",2022-08,2022-08-25,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

I do believe that only Air France can extend my credit, as it is Air France who cancelled the original flights and said I would have a credit.

Any modifications you make to your itinerary will have you pulling your hair out....,Boston,Seoul,International,"Holy moly. The website makes it seem so easy to modify your flight, but don't be deceived! You will be on the phone, holding to speak to a live agent for HOURS only to be told you have to call another locality. When you finally do connect to the US office, they will say you need to call the local office. When you call the local office, they will say to call the US office. 

They also advise you contact them via Messenger, Twitter, or KakaoTalk - and none of them will give you answers (or even responses). They will only tell you to call and speak to an agent. Basically, you are back to square one. 

I have wasted DAYS, trying to confirm a modified return flight, which shows up in the app and under my booking ID BUT apparently isn't ""ticketed"" until you actually connect with an agent via phone, and they have to send documents to another location to confirm and then send you a confirmed, new e-ticket. It doesn't matter if your reservation says ""scheduled"" and you go through the hoops like claiming seats, adding travel documents, and all else. Essentially, the website will make it seem like you've officially modified your ticket, only to have you show up at the new departure time and be told you are not on the list!!! They don't answer calls, they don't answer emails, they are incompetent, and they will keep passing the buck to the next office and next locality. 

I stayed on hold for 40 minutes before finally connecting to someone, and they put me on hold for an additional 20 minutes while ""confirming"" only to return and tell me that they now have to send the documents to another office, and that office will email with the updated tickets within 72 hours!

Avoid at all costs. Horrible customer service.,Paris,Marseille,Domestic,"Poor inflexible customer service, no flexibility given covid diagnosis. Would have expected flexibility given current pandemic vs nothing!!!",2022-08,2022-08-06,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,1.0,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
No Ethics,New York City,Algiers,International,"I booked a flight for my wife and canceled it within one hour. Per their website you get a full refund if canceled within 24 hours. Few days I received $20 less than what I payed. After canceling the 1st flight I booked a second one. Couple of days laters I received a message from the bank saying that my card was credited. This time the amount was full. I initially though that the whole flight was canceled because of the staff shortage in the airports. I therfore simply booked a third flight (more expensive as we get closer to the trip date. When I check online I found that the second flight wasn‚Äôt canceled for everyone. My wife spent hour on the phone trying to teach them and ask them to explain why they canceled the flight. After being put on hold forever, and disconnected twice while with a representative she was told that she did th√© cancelation. She asked for a proof of this cancelation because she didn‚Äôt. They simply told her that they can do nothing about it. She then asked why the amount refunded for the first flight was short by $20 dollars. They said she would have to make a request. When I tried to make a request for her I find out that her previous bookings disappeared from their system.
I then tried to change the last flight to have less waiting time. The website is programmed to make you pay extra whatever you do. The same flight with less waiting time would cost 30% less than what I paid if booked on third party websites. But since they already charged my card they could afford to shoot any price they want. If you try for instance to change both the departing and return it will offer a low price for the change of the departing leg. But when you go to the return it will charge an other $160 to keep the same flight. If you choose to change only the departing flight it will charge you $160 for it. The botom line is that they will charge you for the change no matter what. It‚Äôs programmed that way. The issue is that while I payed around $1800 for a total of 29 hours layover in the airports, you could get a cheaper flight with Air France with a couple of hours layover at $1150. So basicaly if you are already an Air France Customer they will rip you off even more. But if you use a third party website you get a cheaper deal.
Also, there is noway to send a formal complaint. No email to send to. Their website does not offer you any option to write a complaint and if you call them, you need a day off to afford waiting for hours (with no result). They have a terrible customer service. One of them was very rude (NY office).

Very uncomfortable flight,Yerevan,Toronto,International,"My first and last time flying with Air France. The smaller airplane from Armenia to Paris was extremely uncomfortable and had no TV screens. 

The airplane from Paris to Toronto was larger and thankfully had TV screens.  Other airlines have more options of shows/movies however. 

The plane was very uncomfortable  and the food provided was terrible.  ""Dinner"" was pesto sauce smeared on some bread. Drinks were only provided twice throughout the entire 8 hour flight!  Normally, drinks are served at least 4-5 times during a short flight (let alone a long distance flight)... I found myself extremely thirsty and had to ask for water a number of times since it was not being provided.  My friend started coughing mid trip and needed water so she clicked the button to call an attendant for assistance but no one bothered to come or acknowledge the fact that we called a crew member.

tried the customer service in almost every possible way (Telephone, Social Media and emails) but non could support even with an expected date or month.

Worst airline and service,London,Seoul,International,"I had a flight to London to Paris with an hour layover and then a 12 hour flight from Paris to Seoul booked for 24/06/22. However there was a delay in London and so consequently missed my connecting flight to Seoul. Air France booked my flight for the 26/06/22 meaning I was stuck in Paris for 48 hours. In the meantime they claimed I can get my money back for whatever I spend in Paris. The worst two days ever not knowing what was happening! Furthermore when I tried getting compensation back for the 48 hour delay and what i spent, they had the audacity to deny it! My flight was also delayed constantly on the way back to London.

Terrible non-existent customer service - no humans you can talk to directly,Vancouver,Paris,International,"My wife and I paid for direct roundtrip flights from Vancouver (YVR) to Paris (CDG) for our honeymoon trip, and that's where our first experience (and probably last) with Air France goes horrible.

To start, our direct return flight home to Vancouver got cancelled, and they tried to put us on a connecting flight a day earlier, which obviously does not work with our travel plans as we are not even in Paris that 1 day earlier. 
Secondly, our seat selections for both our outbound and return flights that we made suddenly disappeared and my wife and I got separated to seats that were not together. We had booked our flights way earlier and there were lots of seat options at the time, but because they for whatever reason lost our seats, there were no good options left and my wife and I were stuck with choosing the only remaining option left for 2 seats together that were terrible, because all the seat selections had been taken now.

I had to go through multiple several hour long phone calls with customer service to 1) get on a new connecting flight (no longer direct) for our return flight home, and 2) sort our all the seat selections for all of these flights, now that we were no longer on direct flights. What's weird is that our connecting flight home is now on Delta Airlines for both legs, not Air France??? And they could not confirm me and my wife's seat selections to be next to each other for these flights, probably because they are on Delta Airlines rather than Air France???

To make complaints, the customer service phone line does not handle this as they only handle reservations. We filled out the online complaint form on June 22 and have yet to hear back, as our flight is in less than a month now. We called their customer service line multiple times again to follow up on our complaint case #, but was told each time that they cannot do anything to help. When we asked to speak to a supervisor/manager, or be transferred to ANYONE who could possibly help, they said there is no human we can speak to directly, nobody they could transfer me to, no email or phone number to directly contact, and that I would have to wait for an email response to our complaint form, which again we had already waited for more than 1.5 months.

In summary, this is our first time booking with Air France, and we have never experience such terrible non-existent customer service. This is not a single human you can speak to directly who can help with making things right. All you can do is submit an online complaint form into a black hole of cases that will never be addressed. I've tried multiple channels to reach ANYONE who can help, but each time I was told there is nobody who can help you, sir.

The good and the bad,Paris,Johannesburg,International,"All 3 flights (JNB-CDG-BOD as well as CDG-JNB) were most enjoyable with a friendly crews and good food. The facilities in the Business Class lounge for departure to Bordeaux were outstanding. 
But...
1.	The aircraft noise level in the business class section of the aircraft is really too high. It is the first time I have experienced the Boeing 777. It is very much noisier than any of the Airbus long distance aircraft.
2.	It was totally unacceptable that we were not informed of the change in departure time of flight AF 990. Our ticket states departure at 23:25. It was only by good chance that we decided to arrive early at CDG for shopping and spending time in the Business lounge. We got there at about 20:30 only to discover that departure time had been brought forward 2 hours to 21:15!!! Surely this was known  a few days before. What would have happened if we had been booked on a train or plane to arrive in time for the last check in time (22:25) as indicated on the ticket?
3.	We received an email requesting feedback about the flight CDG-JNB, but when we wanted to respond a few days after our return home, a message came up saying the survey had closed. What on earth is the point of asking for feedback and expecting your passengers to answer immediately?",2022-07,2022-08-02,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.1219191587249426,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0

"Disorganised, chaotic, unhelpful national airline carrier",London,Pointe-a-Pitre,International,"Do not fly Air France! Ever! They are appalling.

First off they changed our flights with less than 12 hours notice. Instead of a fairly simple London Heathrow - Paris Charles de Gaulle - Pointe a Pitre Guadeloupe they sent our family of 4 (2 kids (ages 11 and 15 who has Autism and ADHD, 2 adults) from London Heathrow to Tel Aviv then Tel Aviv back to CDG and then Paris Orly to Guadeloupe. So we had to then complete a last minute Entry to Israel application whilst in the queue to check in. They failed to arrange a transfer in Paris so we had to find a taxi and pay an additional 100 euros. 
On arriving at CDG it became apparent they had lost all 4 of our suitcases somewhere between London and Tel Aviv and Paris. We arrived at Orly exactly 60 minutes after our plane was due to depart so had to try and jump the queues for security and passport control. Luckily we made it!
No thanks to Air France.

Our luggage never turned up during our holiday so we had to purchase sun tan lotion and some clothing essentials whilst on holiday in order to wear some clothes that suited the climate!

On our last day I got a message from Air France to say 1 suitcase had been located. The day after we left Guadeloupe it was sent there from Paris. It was apparently then sent back to Paris the next day and was due to be sent to our local airport in the UK 7 days ago but when I checked with that airport it has never arrived. So all I can assume is it is still Simeon CDG along with our other 3 unlocated suitcases. 

Every time I have tried to contact Air France I have been in and to speak to anyone about losing 24hours off our holiday, about losing all our luggage, about how best to claim compensation for our missing belongings. 

I have done a fair bit of travelling in my time with BA, Emirates, SAS, Iceland Air, Qantas, Virgin, Easy Jet, Ryan Air and Westjet and I can categorically say that Air France are by far the most unprofessional, unhelpful, rude and arrogant airline I have ever flown with. Needless to say they will not be getting any more business from me and I have spread this message loud and clear to my family and friends!",2022-07,2022-08-01,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
Not impressed ! Won't fly again. Only booked Air France as I was gifted the points,Manchester,Nice,Europe,"I had never flown with Air France before, which is odd in a way as I lived in France for 5 years.
Everytime I considered them as an option. They were always significantly more expensive than any other airline flying the same route. So I would always pick another airline, BA as first choice but happy with EasyJet especially on a short flight.
However as a member of the Accor loyalty program you now get Flying Blue points as well as the normal hotel points. I had enough for a one way European flight, so this seemed like the time to see Air France first hand.

Even with the points, the cash surcharge meant Manchester to Nice change at Paris CDG to Orly ( fairly straightforward ) was the same price as Easyjet which was direct.

If you want to see a full trip report on my experience there is a video on my YouTube channel, Some Bloke Who Travels a Lot ( link in bio on here )

Now it wasnt that it was terrible, it was just distinctly average. Why pay premium money for an average product.
Standard eurpean short haul, Embraer 190 to Paris CDG in 2 x 2  then A319 Orly to Nice in 3 x 3. Legroom was similar to other airlines low cost and carrier.

To my surprise, with the premium price and other options, both flights were full. On the first flight I was also surprised that only 1 crew gave the safety demo stood right at the front. Even though the Embraer 190 is under 100Pax it still has over 20 rows and you couldn't see the demo from where I was sat.
In economy there was an included snack service. A drink and a pleasant sandwich.
Business didnt seem to fare much better. How do I know ? They didnt bother to shut the curtain. I know it doesnt sound like much but its little things that. That showed me they werent even trying, even for their premium passengers.

The transfer to Orly was pretty straightforward, but it did add another ‚Ç¨20 to the overall cost and an extra hour.

Then we added another 1hr and a half for a delay. Boarding didnt seem to have any structure to it, but as I was in economy at the back, I just waited till the end.

Snack service again, which was just a biscuit and a drink. But I have to say the biscuits was delicious. I would of asked for another but the crew didnt seem approachable  in an extra biscuit kind of way !

There were 2 crew doing the demo this time but only 1 in economy at the front. Who did actually make the effort to dash to the back a few times.
Again the business curtain was not closed. So I could see business were served from the same trolley as economy ?

Cabin lights weren't really dimmed for a night landing ? Certainly not noticeable. Importantly a possible safety issue, but also for a window seat geek no real way of filming the night approach.

Terrible,Olbia,Birmingham,Europe,"Dear Sir / Madam,

I am writing to you to raise an issue about: Airlines

The issue that I have experienced was: We arrived at Olbia airport on 11/06/22 for our inbound flight to Birmingham via Paris 3 hours prior to departure in our pre booked transfer. On arrival the check in desks were not ready (it took 40 minutes for them to be ready which cut down check in time) we received an email a day prior stating boarding passes were unable to be sent to us online and to check in at air port desk . Once we reached the desk we handed over our passports and weighed our baggage with no issues until staff tried to print boarding passes and were unable to locate us on the flight - we‚Äôd insured the flight paid for seats provided proof we‚Äôd paid for the flight and were flying inbound we provided as much information as we could so they could locate us and board our flight . After about an hour they sent us to the ticket office who also had the same issue they tried ringing Air France who did not answer the phone until after the flight was closed and we were unable to board . One of the Air France staff at the airport that carried a clipboard and seemed to keep track of the flights then pulled us aside and began speaking to us quite rudely and aggressively telling us we were causing people to miss their connecting flights because they were unable to find our boarding passes and that the flights were closed , no alternative flight was offered neither were food vouchers or accommodation we were told to ring Air France our selves and were unable to get through , my phone bill cost double this month because of this . We then had to pay for another hotel in Olbia as the airport shuts between the hours of 2300 and 0500 pay for another flight from Olbia to D√ºsseldorf and from D√ºsseldorf to Birmingham we arrived home over 24 hours later than we should‚Äôve missed a day of work and went over on airport parking incurring a fee

It occurred on: 2022-06-11

This meant that We were both extremely stressed by this and we incurred a lot of extra costs we both work in healthcare and work was left short staffed due to what happened. It has been over 30 days and air France have not even acknowledged our claim . If you look at the date and time stamps on the WhatsApp messages you can see we were at the airport within a timely manner .

We would like a refund for the flight we were denied boarding on , a refund for the flights we had to buy as a result , a refund for the hotel we paid for and compensation for the 24 hour delay as well as an apology

"AWFUL,  HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, IGNORANT STAFF",Paris,New York City,International,"Air France lost a golf bag three weeks ago.  Apparently it was pilled up on top of 30,000 other luggages in a hanger at CDG.  One week later my daughter's luggage was taken off the flight to ""accommodate"" the previous flight luggage that was not put on due to cargo security reasons (ended up with two flights worth of luggage - staff on the ground did not know how to properly put cargo on so as we pulled off the gate, the captain realized the cargo was not spread correctly and everything had to be unloaded to be reloaded - I guess that could bring a plane down?? 1 hour sitting at the gate) .  As a result, her luggage (although we paid extra and over $2,500 for the flight) was taken off and we have not heard, tracked the luggage for 10 days on top of the other golf bag.  No one is willing to help.  Most can't speak English or French in an understandable way.  Some can't read either and don't understand where to look or how to help - I was told twice that the luggage was on a flight on the 22nd of July.  Well, it was  AF22 they were looking at which is the flight number.  Customer service is inconsistent, incredibly unprofessional and although we have been Air France customers for 40 years, this will be the end.  AF should not be in service as I can only imagine the incompetence in other areas including safety.",2022-07,2022-07-26,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
Horrible service all the way through - final straw lost luggage and cannot locate it,Mumbai,New York City,International,"I went on Air France as a partner airline when I booked a Delta flight round trip flight from JFK to BOM.  I can honestly say that as a regular and frequent international flier on several airlines, this has been my worst experience ever.  The flight attendants on AF were condescending, the airline food unpalatable, and the ground staff seemed more interested in looking at themselves in the mirror than attending to any customer issues.  The unkindest cut was when they lost my luggage on the return flight and still do not where it is -- more than 36 hours after we landed at JFK.  Their customer service line is not taking any requests and hangs up after a canned message. We finally got through to Delta who said we should speak to Air France.  We waited for 2 hours(!!!) for someone to pick up the phone at AF and was told -- yes, many are frustrated, what can we do, Paris airport is so chaotic.

Very stressful and disappointing experience,Washington DC,Athens,International,"We have traveled Internationally many times but we have never experienced anything like this. The customer service was absolutely rude, inpatient, and untruthful. All of our connection flights were an hour late. Most importantly, our flight had 10 hours layover in Paris coming from Greece. I reached out to customer service using the 800 237 2747 which is not even located in France (it is a call center in India) who have informed me several times, all I needed to do was submit online claim for hotel accommodations on our 10 hours overnight layover. When I submit the online claim they tell me to call back the 800 number who then informed me I need to reach out through Facebook messager. On that communication I was informed I should ask for accommodation in person when I get in Paris. Upon our arrive in Paris @11:40pm the customer service informed us they will not be providing us with hotel accommodation since we bought the ticket knowing there was a layover. They only provide accomdaition if your flight is canceled or delayed. Which did not make sense because all of their flight from Greece to Washington, D.C.  had layover at the time of our booking. 

This was completely new information for us since we have been communicating with their customer service for over three weeks before our travel which could have made our own hotel booking if they didn't lead us to believe they will provide one for us. Because we arrived around midnight there was no hotel available for us during our layover and we had to sleep at the airport. We are absolutely disappointed with how they handled the conversation at their customer service office in Paris where we were told, ‚Äúsorry you received misinformation but since our call center is not in France we cannot control what information they give.‚Äù This is the first airline we know of that have no control over their customer service.

We will never use this airline and I advice anyone who might have similar flying scenario to make your own accommodation regardless of what the customer service tells you. We were not the only people who spent the night at the airport, there were many families with kids who slept on the floor. Absolutely horrible the way they speak to you and also condescending.",2022-07,2022-07-24,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
"Flying Economy but received First Class Service, Food & Beverages",Paris,Dakar,International,"It‚Äôs been a while since either my wife or myself but - based on yesterday‚Äôs experience -I strongly suspect this will become a more regular occurence.

In this regard, our day didn‚Äôt start well having to experience a lengthy check-in which was largely my own fault as I was in the KLM and NOT Air France queue!! This was followed by a good hour spent in the Security queue and then we discovered our Air France flight to Paris in limbo as the air bridge had malfunctioned and there were no steps available to enable the incoming passengers to disembark - another wasted hours but the blame could hardly be laid at Air France‚Äôs door!

By the time we reached Paris there was barely time to get to the Gate before we were boarding our Dakar Flight. Seating (pre-booked dual seats) was very good and the in-flight service was outstanding - as was our dinner (the best economy class service and F &B I have come across).

Do not fly AirFrance!   They will steal things out of your delayed luggage and then never take care of your claim!,Barcelona,Detroit,International,"On May 27th, my daughter and I were flying AirFrance from Barcelona to DTW with a layover in Paris. AirFrance did not allow much time to catch transfer flight in Paris to DTW, we had to literally RUN to our next flight to make it!. ! So you would think our luggage would have made it but AirFrance failed to get our luggage on the flight home. We get to Detroit and no luggage at all! Delta Airlines was the one handling it which was totally a mess. No one knew when it would be delivered and communication between Delta and AirFrance was non-existent!

We waited for 4 days without our luggage and FINALLY it delivered. When it did, my daughter's luggage had been rummaged through and her jewelry had been stolen out of her bag. There was over $1000 worth! I wish she wouldn't have put it in her check-in bag but we didn't think someone from the airline would steal from us!  I put in a claim which it had a Delta Claim # but they told us we had to contact AirFrance for any updates. The last update we received was on June 6.  Too late for me to make any claims through our insurance. It's almost impossible to call and talk to a person. I was able to get ahold of someone on June 25, 2022 and they said to check back in a week that they are very busy with claims. I have been trying to contact them and it keeps saying they are not open. It's now almost 2 months later. Worst experience and don't know what to do now!

Every single one has been delayed with either no or pretty lame excuses. My experience with the personnel is almost always negative but the worst experience was in Paris when I needed to check-in but my boarding pass had been blocked as I hadn't been able to upload my covid result. It was mayhem at the airport and the extremely few existing personnel kept sending me to 'retry' to get my pass at a machine, which simply wasn't possible- something they refused to believe. Finally I found one decent member of staff who tried the machine with me and realised it wasn't possible to get my boarding pass. Fortunately she also realised that I had 'sky priority' and so I could check in in an area with no queue and lots of staff who sorted the problem out quickly. In the end I made it but I hate to think how things would have been if I hadn't had priority- I would have almost certainly missed the plane.

WORST travel experience in 54 years!!,Rome,Minneapolis,International,"I see I'm not alone in my frustration.  AF delayed out flt. out of Rome- no explanation.  Ran to our connecting international flight- closing the doors as we ran up.  We could still see people on the gang way.  There were 14 rudely told to talk to the Customer Service Desk.  Even the AF employees in the Service area were notedly frustrated as they were trying to reroute 14 people when our originally flight was still sitting at the gate!!!
They checked us into a $40 a night hotel, sketchy, ground level, with evidence of drug dealing openly.  Left and self checked into a safe hotel.  Were not allowed access to our luggage.

I tried to book a ticket for my wife in October 2022 (Flexible) from Beirut to Rome, but I was blocked with error, suddenly (about 10 minutes) the booking requires much more than my earned miles, with plenty of stops and with diverse airlines, in short the miles that I was collecting for years are useless, unless I booked a ticket to Paris via Air France, I made a big mistake joining flying blue, it is a waste of time and money.

Flying Fish but Not Flying Luggage! A Saga of Luggage Twice Lost and Air France's Weird Obsession with Salmon,Boston,Florence,International,"Horrible airline!! They lost my baggage going to Florence. Never gave me any updates even though I completed the lost baggage form. After four days with no updates, I had to take a chance and go to the Florence airport, and ask for help from the 'Lost Baggage' staff. They took me to the tarmac where there were thousands of lost bags, and they told me to find my baggage. After a lot of looking, my bag ended up being in the AlItalia luggage bin. HOW and WHY? After finding it, Air France lost my bag AGAIN on the way back to Boston. We had hours between our connection (Florence to Paris, Paris to Boston) AND there was a Priority flyer sticker on my bag. Totally pointless. Whatever you do, DO NOT fly Air France. The Worst. Also, their menu has an uncommonly large number of salmon and other fish courses. It is just weird. I had salmon shoved at me no less than three times in two flights.

"Air Frances, Criminal Negligence",Paris,New Delhi,International,"Air France - Criminal Negligence?

To WHOM IT MAY CONCERN

I am one of 15 independent travelers who were denied boarding of flight AF226 to New Delhi at the boarding gate on the 7th July 2022. AM.

Boarding was denied by Air France staff at the gate, in a ‚Äúblanket‚Äù like fashion claiming it was due to NOT having transit visa‚Äôs. However it was Air France's own Telephone Customer Service Team who informed me I did NOT need one! The conversation was recorded and I am seeking legal advice.

How is a customer to reconcile these two opposed positions inside Air France's own team of staff?

In addition to this Air Frances staff at the boarding gate didn't even check what documents I DID HAVE in my possession . The attitude of Mr Theron Xavier Yves Frederic (you can see a picture of his hand below! As he was uncomfortable about me wanting his details so covered my phone), and the Senior Indian Lady with him, was one of instant rejection WITHOUT even checking our paperwork. This demonstrated that denied boarding was clearly PLANNED before our arrival. So then why let the customer arrive at the airport at all? This is negligence.

Had anyone checked my paperwork they would have known I had everything that had been requested of me by Air France prior to my arrival at the gate, and MORE, as I went to the trouble of emailing Bureau of Immigration in India who CONFIRMED to me in WRITING that in my situation I did NOT need a transit visa, but the Indian lady just wanted to give a ‚Äúblanket‚Äù ban on ALL customers, without checking documents at all (planned). This is clearly the deliberate ""bouncing"" of certain groups of people for the purpose of profiteering.(anyone who was passing thru and not an Indian National)

The knock on consequences of Air France‚Äôs actions resulted in me losing my connecting flight to Thailand, having to spend 3 days in a hotel near Charles De Gaulle, spend a further 1491.50 Euros on an alternative flight to GET ME HOME and finally LOSS of income due to me not being able to get back to my business in Thailand on time.

On it‚Äôs own‚Ä¶this is a bad enough situation, but when this is combined with the deliberate DAY LONG abuse suffered at the hands Air Frances staff in the ticketing office whose function and training has clearly been geared to simply BLOCKING refunds, rerouting assistance and indeed ANYTHING that could be deemed helpful to the inconvenienced customer, this was enough to make the whole group consider planning a class action lawsuit against Air France for negligence and incompetence or deliberate profiteering by ""bouncing"" certain groups of passengers for whom they think they can get away with this type of dishonest conduct.

I can honestly say that in all my 55 years of age I have never witnessed anything as disgusting as the conduct of Air France staff in the ticketing office at Charles De Gaulle on the day of 7th July.

As a result of negligence on the part of Air France I am seeking compensation for the following:-

Loss of connecting Flights
Loss of Income
Expenses arriving from being forced to spend 3 unplanned days in Paris
Loss of income due to being unable to return to my business
Expenses involved in finding alternative flights home

Feedback,Washington DC,Paris,International,"Firstly ) everything was perfect. Our final destination was Warsaw ( Poland) and we fly from Washington - Paris-Poland. One of our baggage was destroyed ! They harmed it I can imagine what they need to do to made this. Our secondly baggage was lost ). When I come home I was surprised that my clothes was stolen. They stole my T-shirt with Stitch, new white top and underarma top ! I think in this times when in Ukraine, in my home  is war while some workers stole just clothes is disgusting and  disrespectful .  To take only upper clothes such as a T-shirt was something of a shock for me.

The worst airline meals in the world,Mexico City,Paris,International,"Please don't choose Air France when traveling. They serve the worst meals! They are like an insult to the passengers. 

My daughter asked for a gluten free menu, because she is intolerant to gluten. When the meal was served, she was told they didn't even have gluten free food and was just given a bag of chips (which were disgusting) and a gluten free muffin. 

The drink was TINY! I asked for a Coke and I was given the tiniest cup and I was never offered more.

On the flight back, the food was even worse! The pasta was a dish of the tiniest pasta pearls you've ever seen with two little pieces of zucchini and three drops of tomato sauce. And the salad was a plate of who knows what that was also inedible. And for dessert, another shapeless ""pastry"". It looked so awful that I couldn't even try it. 

But that wasn't even the worst of all! For lunch, we were given a ""happy meal box"" with the most ridiculous items, which I couldn't eat. Luckily, I had brought my own lunch. The box had a bag of cherry tomatoes, a kind of dry muffin, a mini yoghurt, a mini baguette (was I supposed to fill it with the cherry tomatoes?) and an artificially flavored orange juice.

Headed for lounge after transit passport control to be hit by another passport control to get to K Gates. They were unmanned so thought we were in the wrong place. Approached other areas and AF staff from a pilot transiting to passport control elsewhere, received mix and all wrong information. Eventually told the passport control opened at 7am, our flight gate closed at 715am. Flight delayed and big queue to board. Short haul AF is now a budget airline.

My first experience,Chennai (Madras),Boston,International,First time we preferred to travel Delta operating Air France and felt worst experience in my lifetime Air travel experience since 1985 in different Air craft.

Mrs.,Minneapolis,Banjul,International,Never in my life have I experienced worse customer service. I spent countless hours with multiple issues with my booking and nothing was ever fixed. Then I COVERED my suitcase with my work monitors in fragile stickers and out of all my luggage it is the only thing damaged! Not only was my suitcase all cracked up but my monitors are damaged to the point were they can no longer be used. I wrapped them in a down comforter and placed fragile stickers all over! Now that I filed a claim on this 3 weeks ago I still have not received any feedback! And when I call to check on my claim the phone just hangs up. I experienced issues at the beginning middle and end of this booking and I am still going through issues getting compensated for my damaged goods. The customer service reps are rude and the overall customer experience is not worth what they charge. I fully plan on getting in contact with the BBB about this airline. I highly suggest a different airline. Turkish airline is way cheaper anyway! Don‚Äôt waste your money here! Nothing but a headache.

Baggage lost for more than 3 weeks with no help,London,Paris,Europe,"The worst experience I have ever had taking a flight. 
First, the check in lines were long and there were clearly not enough staff for it. 
Second, the flight delayed for over an hour due to bad arrangement of flights.
Third, more than 5 baggage were lost in a flight which causing a long queue on the luggage center. However, there were only two staff there.
Here comes the worst thing. The staff promised to deliver the missing baggage to my address within a week. Turn out it is still missing while I am writing this comment, which is almost a month since my flight. I tried different methods to contact Air France and it is really hard to call them. There is a email that you will never get a response. There exists a phone number but you had to wait for at least 35 minutes before they pick up your call. I Called a lot in these three weeks ,wasting a lot of times but no one really could help. I went to the airport, imagining someone can help if I meet them, but the baggage service center was closed and all other staffs told me they can do nothing.

Worst experience I have ever had.,Seattle,Paris,International,"Ground crew was extremely RUDE! 
I asked for help with their self serve baggage process. I said can you please help me with this and she rolled her eyes and said NO! 
Then I am finally relieved to be boarding the plane. When I put my ticket on the scanner that would open the door it wouldn't open. The attendant then took my ticket and my passport but wouldn't tell me why. I asked what the matter was and she said just stand there. Then she had loud words with her co-worker.  It turned out it was just a random check but they could have said this. I was sincerely worried I wasn't going to make my flight. I was the first in line and the last to board. 
When I arrived back in Seattle 2 thirds of the plane received their bags in a timely manner. The rest of us waited for 45 minutes and asked the Air France attendant if more bags were expected to come. She said ""Are you stupid look at the sign""! And she said no more bags were expected. 
So I told her this doesn't make sense. They had 1/3 of my flight that still needed our bags but they also had many bags on the same baggage claim that were not picked up. So I approached her again to point this out and again she said are you stupid! She said of course there is a problem because there is a strike. Just then the rest of the bags came up! 
You literally couldn't pay me to ever fly with Air France again. I am a frequent flyer and this is by far the worst experience I have ever had. Things happen but the least they can do is care. No madam I am not stupid and you and your co-workers are rude at best. You should be ashamed of yourselves and should find a new career that doesn't involve helping people.

Mediocre,New York City,Paris,International,"This review is based on three different business class flights.

The first leg was from NY, JFK to Paris CDG. The plane was big, my business class seat was comfortable, with enough storage space. They gave us an envelope with mask, wipes etc... Masking was not required but encouraged. I cannot say the plane was clean, there were crumbs around my seat. The entertainment was good, the food was average... I had requested vegetarian and they offered me foie gras !! My risotto was ok, a bit greasy. Overall it was ok. 

The second leg Paris CDG to Yerevan EVN  was horrible. The business class seat was just a regular coach seat that barely reclined. The only difference between back of cabin and business class was that they kept an empty  seat between me and the other guest. They also had food service that was horrible. Overall I would give this leg of my trip only one star.

The third leg was Paris CDG to JFK. Similar to my first leg, it was a decent business class seat with enough storage room. Food was mediocre and entertainment was good. Overall the plane could have been cleaner. In general flight attendants were courteous and friendly. Plane left on time and arrived on time.",2022-06,2022-07-01,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0

Never again.,Tunis,London,International,"I used to take 4 flights every 6 weeks with AF. Mostly my baggage wouldn‚Äôt arrive at LHR with me. I was delayed 6 hours in Paris after travelling from Tunis to LHR. It meant I had been travelling for around 16 hours that day, I didn‚Äôt want to chance driving the hire car I had reserved upon arrival at LHR. I took a taxi home which cost me ¬£100. AF wouldn‚Äôt reimburse me for this, nor for the ‚Ç¨20 internet I had to buy on board to inform my colleagues and my wife that I would miss the meeting and be home late.

Their unwillingness to do what is reasonable has cost them a regular traveller. I won‚Äôt be flying with AF again.

We ended up at the desk and turns out our ticket ID was invalid. They had to call Air France AGAIN for them to fix the ticket ID. It took almost 2 hours to get this fixed. I don't understand why Air France did not check when we had called the day before about this issue. Because of this we couldn't even chose our seats because everything was taken so we were unable to sit together.

The space between the seats is OK, but not impressive, but not in any way claustrophobic either.

"Good, could be betterüòä",Osaka,Rome,International,"I departed from Osaka Kansai on May 26, to Paris and then a connecting flight with final destination Rome.

I chose to travel with Air FRANCE because it was the ""cheapest"" and the ""shortest"" route.
I would recommend flying with them as the trip was ok, but there are many things to improve!

ENTERTAINMENT: Duration of the first flight is 15 hours (due to war the plane does not fly over Russia). Although I was worried for this very long trip, time passed quickly aboard. Honestly, I didn't watch any movies, but I peeked at the selection and it was very large and there were films that came out recently or great classics like Harry Potter. Super positive note: THE WI-FI! It's free for everyone just to send light messages (no audio, no photos) but if you pay you can get it faster!

SEATS: The seats were very uncomfortable for me, and I'm pretty sure my seat was broken as it reclined back by itself.

CLEANING: BAD. As soon as I got to my seat, it was all dirty, full of crumbs all over the seat and food stains on the table, near the window etc. Even the pillows and blankets bags were open ... Unfortunately I don't think it was an oversight because it was the same on my second flight from Paris to Rome, there was a coffee stain on the table ... In times of covid this is very serious for me.

As for the online CUSTOMER SERVICE, it is a bit disappointing. The Air France site is difficult to handle. I wanted to change my flight, I did all the steps and then it gave me ERROR, and when I returned to the original booking page they canceled the seats I had purchased in advance ... luckily I contacted the company via messenger and they put everything back to normal!! In the end I discovered that to change the flight you have to call a number. But be prepared, if you call the number from Japan you will have to wait 30/40 minutes !!

Very bad customer service,Paris,Miami,International,"This Air France review is about after-flight customer service.

Because Air France keeps messing up with our Delta Skymiles Program, my spouse and I decided to cancel our Flying Blue Program. In other words, we want our flying miles to go to Delta and not to Air France as we get more Skymiles with Delta.
The problem is that for months we have been trying to contact Air France customer service to cancel our Flying Blue membership but so far we haven't been successful. We tried to follow the steps on their website for membership cancelation, but it didn't work. We emailed them several times asking to cancel our membership but they do not answer our emails (except once but not success). They don't provide help on the phone because they say we have to write an email, and twice the customer service agents hang up on us. The bottom line is it looks like they are doing everything to discourage us to cancel our membership. 
Is there anyone who can help us with this issue? Any advice!
We just want to cancel our Flying Blue membership!!! And never have to deal with Air France again!. It is a true nightmare!
Thank you in advance!

Terrible customer service and communication,Washington DC,Paris,International,"I traveled from Washington DC to Paris on the initial trip and everything seemed fine aside from a few hiccups such as them not giving me dinner when the two people next to me got it,Breakfast was not very good,bread was stale. On my return trip from Paris to Washington,things went way downhill,air France changed our gate 5 times,making us walk back and forth like idiots. They barely bothered to tell us when our gate had changed at all and would have contradicting information between what they were telling people and what was actually on the screen. Our flight also got delayed by 45 minutes Seats are very cramped and uncomfortable,my lower back felt really sore after a few hours.

I hope to save some passengers from them,Bangkok,Paris,International,"This is a BEFORE trip experience, DONT PAY ATTENTION TO IN-FLIGHT RATING

Cancer is to mankind what Air France is to Travel. 
Quick summary of my last 2 experiences with them (already decided to not fly with them ever again but had no choice in term of travel dates). 

1. I had a flight booked for Bangkok -> Paris -> Bordeaux 
I wanted to change to Bangkok -> Paris, not embarking to Bordeaux. 
after a cumulated 5h on the phone, they did not have a solution. 
I had to give up taking a suitcase with me, took only cabin-luggage and simply did not embark my flight to Bordeaux. 

2. My journey was Bordeaux -> Paris -> Bangkok (I'm a French man from Bordeaux  living in Bangkok so this explains the travel routes) 
they canceled the flight from Paris to Bangkok, affiliated me to a flight the day before, automatically. So basically, my flight from Bordeaux to Paris was a day after my flight from Paris to Bangkok. You see where I'm going with this? yes, they did not want to find a free-of-charge solution so I could simply go where I initially wanted to. 

I'm not even mentioning the despicable and unhelpful tone that only French people master to make sure you have the worst experience possible. 
The very definition of customer service is unknown to them.

"Downgraded my 4 seats without notice, a week before travel!",San Francisco,Paris,International,"I booked a flight for 4 in my family, and paid extra in advance to get upgraded seats. 
The only reason I booked this company and so far ahead was to get seats that are safer for Covid, and we paid extra for them.
A week before departure, the airline Airfrance just changed our seat to the back of the plane, without warning, loosing all upgrades we paid for and without refunding us.
They proposed we cancel our flight if we preferred, which was so insulting and stressful since we were about to depart.

I will remember that and never fly air france again. We lost so much money and Air France never refunded us. When they downgrade, they should refund! or provide same quality of better seats!
Here is just says: ""if you want a refund, just call customer service"". We called 5 times, they did hand up randomly. And now we have been waiting for 3 hours... nobody is picking up the phone.

It is a real joke, and a sick one.

Now we either have to cancel our flights, because of health safety reasons, and cancel our entire planned vacation or take the risk to use the random seats they provided, and loose money. We paid 8000$ for 4 seats + all the extras, and 4 months in advance!

Terrible time keeping and lack of courtesy for their own passengers with connecting flights,Dublin,Paris,Europe,"I just can‚Äôt recommend this airline to anyone - for the amount of money that was spent by all customers the business could do a lot better.

"Air France ""La Premier"" perfection",Dubai,Paris,International,"Air France 0655, 08 June 00:40, DXB-CDG

I had the pleasure of flying my first ‚ÄòLa Premier‚Äù on this flight, and I must say this has set a new standard that has spoiled me for the rest of my air travels. I am a Corporate Pilot and do this for a living.

From check-in you are personally escorted at every event, through to your final destination. This started with Dubai security to the First Class lounge, from the lounge to the aircraft door, circumventing all lines.

The B777 had been refurbished about four years ago, but you would think it brand new due to the overall neatness. The Premier section had Only 4 seats! The seat were comfortable and made into the absolute best airline bed that I have ever slept on. They were also wider than most seats so you could actually stretch or roll over onto your stomach to sleep if so desired.

Captain Laurent personally spoke to both of us in La Premier. He was very personable, professional and this added a nice touch. As a pilot, credit to Laurent for an on-time departure and a 25 minute early arrival!

Our two attendants, Marie and Corinne, were also wonderfully friendly, quickly establishing a nice rapport. Their attentiveness and service were exemplary!

On arrival into CDG I was met by an attendant who took me straight off the walkway into a car to be driven to the AF First Class lounge. We were efficiently walked through Security and Customs. The first Class lounge is also one of the bet I have been in. Cook to order breakfast and numerous lounge areas, quiet areas and spacious toilet and shower facilities.

Eventhough my next flight was Business Class, I was driven from the lounge to the door of my next aircraft, and also met at final destination for a personal walk through Customs.

If you spoil yourself once during a lifetime, I highly recommend the Air France ‚ÄòLa Premier‚Äô first class experience. This was the best positioning flight I have experienced and commend all of the AF staff that I had the pleasure of meeting.

"Average airline in all aspects, but food was great",Paris,Minneapolis,International,"Feeling strange. Crew is extremely polite and polished. Flight started and finished with minimum delay (about 10 min), no complaint here. But a lot of small things which make you not very comfortable:
1. In Charles de Gaulle airport, we have been redirected to different gates twice.
2. During boarding, we spent about 20 minutes standing in the jetway, before boarding actually started.
3. Coffee, again. I don't know why Air France serves excellent coffee on flights within Europe, but on a flight to US it's some brown water? Much worse than you can buy in any US McDonalds?
But one thing was great: dinner. Chicken with mushrooms and polenta was absolutely delicious. Never thought you can get something like that in an economy class.

"extra charges for ""preferred seats"" not honored once boarded !",Montreal,Paris,International,"I purchased a ticket through airfrance.ca and paid 100$ extra for front seat (with no one in front). I received my boarding pass, with the correct seat, but once on the plane, the attendant said that they ""changed"" my boarding pass and assigned me a new seat (last row, middle seat,  against the bathrooms ! Essentially the worst place on the plane , despite that i had booked and paid a month prior to the flight). 

I informed the attendant that I had paid extra for this seat so that I do not have anyone in front of me. Given that I had paid extra for my seat, I went to see the stewardess for explanation. We found a 30 somewhat year old man sitting in my seat. not a pregnant lady, not an older person in need of assistance, but just a random person to whom my paid seat was simply given to.

Strangely enough, upon my return, on May 6th, flight AF0342 at 15:10 from CDG to YUL, my seat selection was honored (43J) and the same person was sitting next to me. He refused to comply to the mask mandate. Flight attendants asked him to wear his mask 4 times during the first 3 hours of the flight and then simply gave up.¬† Essentially, permitting him to be the only person on the plane not bound to the mask mandate. Totally unacceptable!¬† and I had to sit next to him for more than 6 hours.¬†¬†

I was never refunded for the premium seat selection that I had paid for and when I called customer service (1-800-667-2747), I was transferred 3 times (about 45 min hold total), and then given an email address contact.en.us@airfrance.fr  to request a refund. I did so. After 4 days I received an email stating ""Please allow us to inform that your concern does not fall under our scope of expertise as we deal with refund related queries.""  

I called customer service back again asking for  a refund of my seat. They informed me that I had to email air France, essentially giving me the run around. I told them that I have done so. The customer service agent then guided me to the website and directed me to send a refund request on the website. I informed her that I had already done so and asked to speak to a manager. The customer service agent, obviously located in India, hung up on me. I found it very unprofessional and very surprising from air France. 

I sent the email again through the website. A response indicated that a response would be received in about 3 weeks ! guess what.....4 weeks later, nothing ! 

I will be contacting my credit card company to resolve this as Air France is obviously places barriers on any form of complaints. 

I would love an explanation as to why the seat I paid over 100$ for was given to some random guy and 2- an explanation as to who this person was, and why was he so important to air France that he was simply given a seat that was paid by another customer and permitted to fly without wearing a mask when strict mask mandates are enforced in all airlines. Why is this person so important that the flight attendants did not force him to wear his mask ?

It should further be noted that during the landing, the stewardess was sitting right in front of him, facing him straight in the eyes and did not say anything about him not wearing a mask. Completely ignored! why ?

 Needless to say I was very unhappy with this flight. I would have understood if my seat would have been given on the last minute for someone with a baby, but this was unacceptable not to mention to be a total lack of responsibility on Air France's behalf for the health consideration to other passengers.",2022-04,2022-06-02,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0

"Bars under feet, no water, no call light",Los Angeles,Paris,International,"Horrendous flight. My husband and I got sat in the middle of a four seat row. Already not great...but bonus was the middle seats have bars underneath them! We could not place our bag under the chair in front of us so we had to put them next to the bar on top of our legs for 10+ hours.

Being crammed like that, after a few hours I needed water, I kept pressing the call light which wouldn't stay on and no one came for over an hour. Finally a flight attendant was walking by and I got their attention. They came back with a TINY cup. I asked if I could buy a bottle of water and they said they dont have any for purchase.

I got up to find myself more water and couldn't find an attendant but saw a little path way with about 10 soda bottles all opened with lids off and cups and everyone was just helping themselves. Gross and weird.

My trip to hell courtesy of Air france,New York City,Naples,International,"My wife planned our 40th wedding anniversary and her 60th birthday trip
It started from jfk to Paris .
Unfortunately plane left late and after running through airport and two lines where they refused to allow us and others to go to head of line we missed connecting flight to Naples
After an hour on another line we we rebooked on later flight with assurances that our luggage would be on same flight
Landing at naples is where our trip to hell continued.
We waited for luggage with some others for an hour .
At that point we went to lost luggage waiting on another line for 45 minutes. When we got to speak to person we were yelled at for having nerve to being upset (no sleep for 24 hours will do that).
We filled out forms and were given a number to call.
48 hours later we called and found out it was wrong number.we were given new number which turns out to be non existing. (Can't make this up).
It is now Wednesday early morning. 
No luggage.no response from air France despite having our email address and phone number.
Our travel agent has been communicating with air France New York office which has reached out to their Naples office which is communicating with Paris.
I understand that stuff happens 
To.me it lack of communication ,at airport,in the time since our luggage has been lost.
Will keep anyone following updated
Can't wait to what will transpire with insurance claims

Never ever ever again.,Bangkok,Birmingham,International,The most cramped long haul flight I have ever had the misfortune to travel on. I can only compare it to a Ryan air flight to alicante.  One meal after 3 hrs and then a hurriedly dished out snack 50 minutes before landing in CDG that's on a 12 hr flight. Drinks came around twice.  When I think about my flights on Malaysian airlines to Bali and the service and experience in contrast feel like crying.  If they offered me to fly free long haul again I would rather stay home.

Business Class Service?,Paris,San Francisco,International,"Air France has a poor business class check-in experience at Paris CDG.  I wanted to check-in a small bag containing food that I could not take through security.  I was carrying my backpack onboard.  Air France refused to check my bag because it was too small.  It seems like they make-up convenient rules in the moment.  of course, my bag of food that was well protected in multiple bags was taken by security due to its liquids.  I later watched as they loaded my 2 checked bag weight allotment with DHL cargo that I am sure they can increase if fewer passenger check bags.

Also, there was no priority security service.

The Air France Business lounge in 2E is very old and crowded.  No free facial service available because of an ""exceptional"" closure.  Food rather limited for breakfast.  Very poor showers with no ventilation.

The boarding process was poorly managed and a complete mess.  There combine economy plus with business in one line in an area that does not have enough room for all these passengers.  Needless to say, people were cutting the line from all directions.  Then we had to wait in the bridge another 20 minutes after entering until they allowed use to actually enter the plane.

Charged ‚Ç¨125 for change to Round Trip - I'll never fly with them again,Paris,Dublin,Europe,"Had to cancel the first part of my flight. I went online and found it was not transparent at all. I could only see how to cancel the whole trip (including the return flight).

As a result, I didn't inform the airline not thinking this would be a problem. Ryanair don't charge for no shows. However, I arrived to the airport and was told that I had to pay a penalty fee of ‚Ç¨125 for not informing the airline of missing my first flight. While I would fully understand paying a fee of ‚Ç¨30 or ‚Ç¨40, the ‚Ç¨125 was almost the cost of my round trip and it's a lot of money especially for someone who doesn't have much money. It was very upsetting on principal as well as the cost. I asked to speak with the manager but they also refused to withdraw or even reduce the fee.

I understand that the staff were simply only doing their job but the company is toxic to the core to exploit their customers like that.

I really don't like leaving bad reviews. I rarely leave reviews in general but if I ever leave a review, I like it to be a positive review to help a business. The reason I'm sharing this is in the hope that it increases awareness of this fee so that other travellers won't make the same mistake I did. Unfortunately, the reality at present is that so many travellers every day get caught with this fee from Air France.

If they're not going to change their toxic ways, hopefully more awareness can be made of this nasty trick.

"Mistakes happens to every airline, but AF is uniquely in how they completely ignore passengers distress",Canton of Geneva,Buenos Aires,International,"I get it:  airlines operate in an unpredictable environment, subject to weather, strikes, security measures, and other factors outside o ftheir control. This results in delays, cancellations, etc etc. Most of the time I (and many other people) play ball because we realize it is out of the airlines control. 

But then there's how each airline treat passengers in these situations : most of the large ones try to solve the situation while doing their reasonable best to take care of the passenger's needs. 

Aifrance approach, on the other hand, is to pass on the ball around and avoid at all costs to interact with the passenger. 

I lost a connection in CDG (AF's main hub!) due to a delay outside their control. It was clear I would miss the flight (although I made it to the gate 5 minutes late!), so AF probably should have avoid sending me to Paris to begin with. Or they could have asked the flight to wait for us (we were like 15-20 passengers). But again, I play ball.  

That's when the issues started: 
+ They put me on a flight to my final destination (EZE) through Madrid, leaving the next day at 7 AM. This happened at around midnight, so I would have 3 hours sleep at best. 
+ The hotel was 30 km away. They said there would be a shuttle, but when we get to the designated park there was nothing. We had to take an uber at our expense. 
+ The hotel had no clue when or if there would be a shuttle back to the airport, since ""AF had told the nothing"". 
+ I finally made it to the airport at 5.30 AM next day. But the airline said AF had not sent them my luggage so I had to embark or I'd lose my flight. 
+ I arrived to EZE and had to spend 1 week without my luggage. AF refused to assist indicating that I should deal with the other airline (despite the fact I never boufht a ticket with them). 

All this time AF never checked on me or my luggage. I called them several times and every time their answer was ""it√†s your problem now"". 

BTW I was travelling on BUSINESS CLASS. If this is how AF treats passengers that pay a ticket that is 4x more expensive than the economy ones, you can just imagine how they will treat the economy ones. 

I strongly recommend to NEVER take a AF flight.",2022-05,2022-05-26,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0819906910132473

Very Bad - Worst experience!,Cork,La Coruna,Europe,"I been told many times on the phone to Air France and KLM that I have not paid for my flight. This is totally false and this is an error on there part. 

This has put great stress on I.

 It has cost me a lot of time and money phoning Air France and KLM approximately ten  times over two days. I have had to take time away from my work to contact Air France and KLM which has cost me quite a lot of money.
 I could be waiting three hours for my phone call to be answered only to be told each time that I have not paid for the flight.

I have given proof that I have paid for this flight but still they told me that I have not.  I have given them the ID number for the payment for the flight which by checking it would proof I did pay for the flight. I also sent them a copy of the Bank Account statement showing the money been transferred to them.

I had also other difficulties regarding booking my puppy. I was told once he could not travel?? When this was resolved again after many phone calls, he was booked for the departing flight and the return flight even thought I told them that it was just for the return flight only. They tried to charge me over ‚Ç¨110 for the puppy when it should have been ‚Ç¨55. I was told the puppy was booked with the luggage even thought I wanted to take the puppy in the cabin and you they were told this when I was booking the flight where I give the weight and demission's for the crate.  

Without my permission AIR France tried to take the amount of ‚Ç¨790.30 from my account without me giving them the go ahead. I was lucky that they were unable to take the amount from my account because there were not enough funds in my account. If they were able, I would have paid for the flight twice.

Terrible Service Don‚Äôt Use Them,Paris,Newcastle upon Tyne,Europe,"I had booked into the airport and was awaiting boarding when I found out my 6 year old granddaughter had been removed due to a technical problem and smaller plane. I was still on the flight!!! I went to the desk and asked how they decide who leaves plane and I was told by ticket price which is a disgrace. No consideration taken for 6 year old travelling back to her parents. They did not ask for volunteers despite another couple stating they would have taken compensation and given up there seats however they were then boarding. 

We were given instructions that we had been booked onto morning flight and told we would get a pack to tide us over night (our case was still in airport so no clothes or medication). The pack was toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant wipe, razor,  shaving cream and an XL tee shirt (yes for the six year old too). So next morning we had to put the clothes we had worn in Disneyland the morning before and all afternoon which is disgusting. We then spend 1.5 hours going round airport collecting pack, compensation and then getting to shuttle. We got lost and had to keep asking for directions however some staff just walked past us without stopping (we later found out another couple had had exactly the same problems).
The hotel we were put up in was 2 star, so basic not even coffee in room. Walls paper thin so you could hear next door and constant buzzing from some heating or electrical appliance. Towels were so thin I would not have used them as floor cloths. It was 11.30 before I could get my granddaughter to bed. We were told we had shuttle both ways but it was fully booked in morning unless we left at 5.30 instead of 7 or we would have missed our flight if we had taken the next available one.

Because of the inept system for claiming lost baggage, we missed out train out of Florence and had to spend a night in Florence, losing a day in the Cinque Terre.

"Targeted, Rude, Family Separated, Thank God we went SUPER EARLY to CDG!",Paris,Miami,International,"So awful, I could not WAIT to get our of France and OFF that AF  plane. 

We flew Virgin over and AF home. Big mistake but how could we have known? UGH

Starting with we could not check in online. Had to call to try to check in, nope. They couldn't tell me why. I had the app. They just told us we had to check in at the airport. We were nervous it was overbooked and we were getting bumped, so we attempted to arrive super early by train from Paris. Thank God we did. We would never had made it if we hadn't left the city at 10 for a 1410 flight.

Got to check in and they gave everyone a covid test sticker on their passport except for one son who was having a hard time pulling up his email. They just waved him on. 

Check in - they couldn't find us. They had a booking number (which the AF app acknowledged), our last names, and our flight, but INSISTED that wasn't enough. They wanted ticket numbers. So I had to dig through all of my printed documents by opening my bag to find the individual ticket numbers. What is that about? Your app clearly sees us and our confirmed reservation but you can't find us? If I don't say it exactly right, you won't help me?  It was like everthing bad we have ever heard about France, didn't believe, and hadn't experienced it at all until we were leaving on the country's major carrier. 

Finally got checked in and off we went. Arriving at the first Embarkment gate, the AF staff separated our family because we have a 14yo and she is a minor. So my husband and sons were not allowed to go with us through to area on the right where the minors are checked in. This area is the same area EU members are checked.  My daughter and I sailed through the EU section with our US passports and boarding passes. This section doesn't have anyone standing guard over bags and eyeing people up and down. 

We had carry ons and personal bags only. This was a mistake with AF but had worked fine with Virgin because their requirements are different. AF weighs carryons AND personal items together. The guys had their laptops in their backpacks so they were overweight, and we had not carefully read that info on AF's site. The guys were shot off to the side to weigh their bags. My husband was forced to check his carryone at this point for being overweight (60 euros). His carryon was light, but his backpack heavy because of the laptop. They were sent out of line bag to the very start to check their bags. 

The credit card machine at check-in wasn't working. They had to call the office and enter the card information over the phone line. 
Ridiculous! At this point, ANY OTHER corporation would say 'sorry, our bad, we'll check it for free because we are INEPT, thank you for flying with us'.  No such luck.

They head back to embarkment. Have their boarding passes checked and passports. Head to security. Now things get really sketchy. This isn't necessarily on AF but definitely made them feel targeted as Americans. They were randomly selected to be searched. All three of them. It's not even like there was something they were looking for. They poked prodded and emptied out all of their luggage. Several other Americans or Candians were there having the same thing done. Nothing was found in any bag. Not even an, oh, here it is! this was what triggered the scan comment. Just complete nonsense. A French national asked for her bag to be moved to the head of the line and they stopped helping the gentleman to take care of her bag first. This is now 1315 and one of the other men had a flight that was ready to take off. He was so upset. The poor guy couldn't believe it. When security started to rumble about their attitudes, one gentleman finally revealed his fluency in French with no uncertain terms.  Eventually they shrug and slide my guys' bags through. The guys repack their suitcases and backpacks and head to the gate. 

Now at 1330 our flight is already boarding. My daughter and I thankfully were able to purchase lunches for everyone at Eric Kayser since we managed to sail through. Waiting on the guys still.  

The boarding line was immense. Catching site of the men, we gather our strength to the side before boarding.  They eat their sandwiches and we fill out Covid paperwork , which is so annoying but that's on Uncle Sam not AF. (As an aside what country in their right mind is going to provide a positive covid test response to an American? Why would they want a positive case trapped in their country??)

Getting in line, we are one of the the last families. They flag #2 son at boarding because his boarding pass, which scanned successfully at least twice already doesn't scan at the gate. #1 Son and Daughter head onto the plane because they were told they could not wait there. So the family is AGAIN separated by AF. 

My husband and I stand to the side to see what happens with #2. I decide to get onboard and let DH stay with #2. They once again rip EVERYTHING apart in #2's bags. Looking for NOTHING!! Nothing at all. Just infuriating. They paint his hands for drugs. Make his take off his shoes and socks. It's ridiculous. Behind them, someone is turned away from the closed gate. #2 is handed his unpacked luggage, he shoves everyting in AGAIN, puts his shoes and socks back on, and they take off RUNNING to get down the ramp and onto the plane. 

At this point my husband has so many 4 letter words running through his head. SO MANY. He uses none of them out loud because that's the kind of guy he is. 

On board, the staff is completely unhelpful with overheads. People have purses and water bottles and shopping bags above to convenience themselves and there is no room for carryons. We are, believe it or not, NOT the last people looking for space overhead. There are several of us. I have never felt that flying economy was 3rd class steerage until that AF flight. I cannot even scream loud enough about how little help you receive. I ended up yeeting my carryon into an overhead across the plane from me. Looking around, I lock eyes with another American who is equally fed up and we both agree we cannot wait to get the HELL out of France at this point. This actually makes me very sad; I was so sure that was all a bunch of hype. 

The food early in flight was very good. They serve you early and late in the flight only. The late meal is bread, muffins, rolls, tomatoes, applesauce and cheese. For a completely daytime trip where everyone is mostly awake, it would have been nice to have drinks offered midway. They just wandered twice with cups and large water bottles to pour you water only. 

The announcements are actually funny. They sound so disdainfully French. I am sure this is cultural. I am way too used to chirpy Disney voices and the funny Jetblue guys.

If you have read this all, God bless your heart. Good luck if you're flying AF anytime soon. May God go with you.",2022-05,2022-05-18,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0

My Trip to Morocco,Seattle,Marrakech,International,"I was part of a big group of families traveling to Morocco for a wedding, our original flight was scheduled with Delta Airline #DL78.
The Delta Airline agent that checked us in saw our vaccination cards and our Negative PCR tests that was valid for 24 hours before departure, but she forced us to get another test at the Airport. We paid $1000.00 and 1hour of stress and unreasonable delay at the Airport. Two other family friends that were being checked with the agent next to us had the same Negative PCR test and Vaccine information and I heard that the agent told them, either Vaccine or Negative PCR is needed to board the plane and they got boarded with no problem. I learned that every agent interprets the guidelines according to what they understand and there is no defined process.
I pointed that to our agent, and she rudely denied it and shouted at me, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre wasting your time, and if I was you, I‚Äôll go downstair and take the test immediately‚Äù
I‚Äôm very much OK with enforcing the rules and regulations from FDA and Delta but not all gate agents are on the same page, and this create bias among passengers. When we got back to the line with the new Negative PCR test results, we went to a different line and another agent.
She checked us in with no problem and gave us our luggage tickets, but she couldn‚Äôt print our boarding passes. After several tries, she said ‚ÄúAir France did not issue the tickets from their end, and she has to fix it with them‚Äù. We missed our flight and Delta, and Air France did nothing to get us to a different flight and after spending several hours at the airport we booked separate flights for me and my family to Morocco for the next day.
I fly internationally a lot, and this was the worst trip I took with Delta and Air France. Not only I incurred extra cost for PCR test, but also, I missed arriving at my destination for the wedding that was a huge loss.

The worst customer service I have ever seen!,London,Tokyo,International,"I booked a flight with Air France to head home to Japan from the England that was booked for January 7th for 11:30 AM. The flight was canceled, and I rebooked it through Air France's website for 9:10 AM (UK time) on January 7th. I needed a valid PCR test to get on the flight. I booked the PCR test ahead of time and confirmed with the PCR test company that it was the right format for the Japanese government verbally when I met them in person. When I got the PCR test result, it was not in the right format and they refused to change it. I booked a new test for the morning of my flight to make sure I could enter Japan. I was not sure whether Air France required the test to get on the plane or it was just required at the boarder of Japan. By the time I was supposed to arrive in Japan, I would have gotten the new test result by email and would have been admitted to the country. I already had the other negative test result, so I figured that the other result may have been sufficient for the flight itself. I had a friend arrive in Japan where the test was checked at the boarder and not by the air line, so I assumed that was a possibility in this case as well. I wanted to confirm whether this was the case or whether I needed to book a new flight with Air France, so I called them. After 4 or 5 attempts, I was not able to get ahold of anyone to ask my question, so I decided to ask them at the airport when arriving in the morning after taking the new COVID test. If I was denied entry, I figured I could just rebook the flight at the airport. When I arrived at the airport, I was denied entry to the flight due to improper formatting of the negative test result form for the PCR test (which was expected). I asked to rebook the flight and was told that I would need to call Air France to do so since the baggage workers don't actually work for Air France. They said that they would leave a note showing that I had showed up to the airport so that I could rebook the flight. I then called Air France and tried to rebook online. I got through most of the rebooking process on the Air France website, but was given an error message that said they were having ""technical issues"" just as I was finishing up rebooking. The message told me to call them. I was left on hold for 2 hours and did not get a hold of anyone before the flight had already left. I eventually got a hold of someone from Air France via Facebook Messenger, and they told me that if I wanted to rebook my flight that I needed to call them, and they said that they cannot rebook a flight via Facebook Messenger. I called them, but they did not answer the phone. I then called Expedia (my travel agent) to rebook the flight, and they said that they could not rebook the flight for me because the flight had already left by that point, so I bought a new ticket for the next day in order to return home. I then requested a refund for the first ticket from Air France, but they told me that in order to get a refund, I would need to send a request through my travel agent. I then contacted Expedia to send a refund request on my behalf. It has been 4 months and Air France still has not responded to Expedia's email yet. Expedia has emailed them twice asking for my refund and the company ignored them. When I asked Air France for a refund they told me to go through my travel representative (Expedia); however, I already did that, and they are just refusing to respond.

Punked by Air France - Switched from a Non-Stop to Paris to a Bad Connection on Aeromexico via Cancun,Mexico City,Tunis,International,"I booked a flight for my wife on Air France from Mexico City to Tunis via non-stop to Paris and connecting flight to Tunis.   About 30 hours before departure she received an e-mail from Air France stating an ""Operational Change"" - her non-stop to Paris was now stopping in Cancun to pick up additional passengers and would not allow enough time to transfer in Paris to her connecting flight in Tunis.   So, Air France booked her on an Aeromexico flight to Cancun.   We immediately realized that the new itinerary didn't allow enough time to transfer in Cancun.  We are permanent residents of Mexico, which requires an exit stamp from Immigration at the airport of departure FROM Mexico.   In Mexico City, Immigration is inside of Security.   In Cancun, it's outside Security, which means when you land on a domestic flight, you can't walk to the connecting gate with your boarding pass - you need to go outside Security to the Immigration booth, get you exit card stamp, and go back through the Security line again.   We tried calling the Air France customer service number in Paris to try getting on an earlier flight to Cancun.   Air France's arrogant response was she needed to contact Aeromexico, because her initial flight was now with them.   We next contacted Aeromexico, and they claimed that since the reservation was with Air France, it was their responsibility to book an earlier flight with them.   So, my wife went to the airport in Mexico City early and went to the Air France counter in Terminal 1 to try to change her flight.   Again, the agent there said they could do nothing about it - it was Aeromexico's responsibility.  Next (at 11am), my wife needed to take a taxi over to Terminal 2, where Aeromexico leaves from.   The Aeromexico agent in Departures said that since her new reservation departs at 5 pm, they couldn't do anything about it until 2 pm.   So, she needed to go over to the Food Court and chill out for 3 hours.   When she came back at 2 pm, they again reiterated that it was Air France's responsibility to put her on an earlier flight to Cancun.   So, she checked in.   The flight to Cancun arrived 15 minutes late.   It took my wife an hour and 15 minutes to go out of Security area to ticketing and the Immigration booth, get her exit card stamp, and go through the Security line again, and find the Air France gate.   She made her flight to Paris with a minute to spare.   Unfortunately, her baggage didn't.   It's still in Cancun.   Aeromexico didn't transfer it to Air France, even on the later flight.   When she finally got to Tunis, the international lost baggage system traced it back to Aeromexico in Cancun.   Hopefully she'll get her luggage in Tunis by tomorrow night , before her tour leaves for the Atlas Mountains.
To summarize, Air France sold a non-stop ticket to Paris in bad faith.   The EU permits ""operational changes"" like an unplanned stop in Cancun to pick up additional passengers and dumping you on another airline that doesn't have any operational coordination for transfers, as long as it's done within 2 hours before departure.   Really no legal recourse for compensation for either the hassle nor the lost luggage.  Delta's  SKY TEAM  is merely a marketing alliance - in terms of accountability, there is none.  It's always ""the other airline's responsibility"".    We've encountered this situation twice before transferring between Delta and Aeromexico.",2022-05,2022-05-09,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,1.0,1.0,3.4978647686832742,1.0,2.0

Nightmarish experience at Sky Priority Check in at o'Hare,Chicago,Paris,International,"Today, I learnt my French grand ma was dying.  I booked a flight last minute, for myself and my 5 years old. My French friends who just came back from France told me I didn't need a Covid test. Phew, as I had to pack, in one hour, everything.
I show up at Sky Priority Check in. After a while, finally I was able to check in. They ask if I had a booster shot. I said yes and gave the date. They needed proof. Unfortunately, my records were not up to date. 

They tell me to get a covid test done at the airport, terminal 2. The nightmare is just starting. With my 3 pieces of luggage, my car seat and my 5 year old, I go to terminal 2 (from terminal 5). There? Nothing. I ask around, and they tell me to go to terminal 1. There? Nothing. They tell me to get on a bus to go by the rentals. Finally, I arrive, after 45 min going all around the airport with all my luggage and my kiddo. I don't have time anymore. . Takes me 5 min to ter 5.

I let them know that they sent me in the opposite direction. Did I get any excuse of any kind? Absolutely zero. zero. zero. They told me it was there, they sent people there earlier today? Seriously? Very very bad service.

Worth every Cent,Paris,Vancouver,International,This is a Summer offering from AF and as services start to return to the new normal with a lot of carriers offering less and less and some who have gone so far down hill it is doubtful if they will ever get back on track it was nice to experience a ull service flight of 9hours 40 mins with a motivated crew who worked hard and knew they had three days rest in Vancouver - the pre ordered meal was available the drinks flowed from champagne on the ground to a first class offerings in the air -in all a very comfortable flight even though the aircraft was 12 years old,2022-04,2022-04-25,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0

Horrible customer service,Canton of Geneva,San Jose,International,"I find Air France customer service calamitous!

After booking and paying for a flight online, the Air France website tells me ""We have received your payment"". Also, I receive an email confirming the reservation.
About 2 weeks later, I learn (after 30 minutes of waiting on my 4th attempt to reach them by phone and while my 3 emails remained unanswered) that my reservation was canceled due to a payment problem.

I am told that there is no other solution: I have to redo the reservation by myself, modify my travel dates and pay 23% more!!!

I have since been trying to file a complaint (5 attempts already) on the Air France site but, as luck would have it, sending the complaint fails each time. Many companies purposely make filing a complaint complicated and time-consuming, so most unhappy customers give up on the way.

He then did the same with passengers in front of me as they laughed embarrassingly, stating manners mattered to him! If he had cared to listen he would have heard that I did say please, but too interested in his supposed superiority! I suggest he takes training in customer service and how not be so rude and to learn to speak clearly over the intercom, as he mumbled each announcement. He must also be aware that he is dealing with different languages and cultures and not just French speaking people whom may clearly understand him.

I was told that the bag would arrive on the next flight (3 days out), and I had to come to collect it at the airport. Miserable start to a bucket-list vacation. Bought clothes and toiletries for the three days (no kit was available, no information on re-imbursement was available from Air France staff on the ground). Came to Airport on 4th day (my holiday schedule disrupted). Collected bag... inside was badly messed up with packets of snacks opened and spilled everywhere. No information on reimbursement at the point of pickup.  Filed compensation form, acknowledged but still no response at almost a month!  All the horror stories on Air France at the various sites are validated.  Had no other option  since only AF was flying to TNR at the time.

"New Equipment, Generous Recline, Atrocious Service",Seattle,Paris,International,"Flying Blue miles provide average value for getting across the Atlantic. With amex membership rewards points, we were able to fly from Seattle to Italy round trip in an open-jaw itinerary for ~55,000 points + $250 per person. At the time of booking this netted us a total value of ~1.2 cents per point, though the availability of cheap fares if you look hard enough makes this an average value redemption big picture. Any value attained from a points booking is the last positive point of the flying experience.

Ground Experience:
Check in started the flight off on a bad note. Since we were booking with Flying Blue miles, Air France would not allow us to add our Delta frequent flyer numbers to the reservation, which would have entitled us to SkyTeam Elite Plus level benefits. Even though we were checking in in Seattle (one of partner Delta's hubs), Air France check in was handled by Swissport contractors who did not know what they were doing. Agent Thy was downright rude to us when we asked her to give us the elite benefits (like priority baggage tags) that we were entitled to. The funny thing was that even though we were denied priority baggage, our boarding passes were still marked with the priority boarding group. Boarding was also disorganized, between the lack of clear signage and the gate staff's lack of knowledge around the facial-recognition system that they were piloting. If you are a US citizen, the facial recognition system is only of some privacy concern since DHS states in their terms of service that images will only be kept for 12 hours. Noncitizens, however, are not entitled to the same rights, creating a compelling reason to opt out. Even so, the gate agents were not sure how to disable the machine when someone asked to be opted out.

IFE:
Though I did not use the IFE system to watch any movies, there appeared to be a large selection of English and French titles, and the moving map was comprehensive (no tail camera, though). Wifi was not functional for the duration of the flight.

Food:
While the presentation of the food was subpar, the food itself was slightly above average. Dinner was served rather late, so I decided to get to sleep before the service began. Upon waking up, I was able to venture to the rear galley, where flight attendants had sandwiches and other snacks available for hungry travelers. Breakfast was nothing great, but the warm pastry was satisfying enough before landing. 

Service:
While service on the ground was horrible, service in the air was slightly above average. Flight attendants were brisk but helpful throughout the duration of the flight.

Seat:
This flight was on a 787-9, a very comfortable ride. The pitch was a little tight, though the recline was very generous. The larger windows and higher cabin pressure also contributed to a pleasant hard product experience. 

Though we paid for this flight in miles, we were sure to pay the taxes and fees with the Amex Platinum, for its 5x points on airfare and trip protection benefits. Beware that these protections (as with any credit card), do not automatically offer the ability to cancel because of COVID-fears, only tangible effects (cancelations, delays, etc.)",2022-04,2022-04-18,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0
Horrible travel experience,Edinburgh,Dallas,International,Once we got to CDG we were Sent multiple directions by employees that were wrong. We ended up going up and down the same stairs multiple times.

All this while the female security member on the other side is yelling at someone else. Well that‚Äôs a great reason to never visit France.

Downgraded from Business to Economy + Rude 'Customer Service',Cairo,Toronto,International,"Decided to downgrade me and a few 'select' passengers to Economy 10 hours before take off via an email.

I was given no other alternate flight options (except to change the dates). For same day flight changes, I was asked to pay the fare difference! As for compensation, I was told to make in online complaint which would be resolved in 3 months and they would not say how much compensation (if any) would be received. 

Booking Air France means nothing folks. They can downgrade and bump you off the flight without any reason or reasonable recourse. 

All this in addition to a generally cold and rude cabin crew. I would avoid Air France at all costs in the future.

The worst customer service,Atlanta,Osaka,International,"The process of refund is too slow and disorganized. I booked a ticket and canceled within 24 hours after purchase. Usually, there should be no problem: I can just click a cancellation button and should be able to get a refund. However, this company required me to submit a request form, to which they never replied. Because they never handled this issue, I called an office in the US. She asked me to call an office in France and transferred me to talk with them. The one in France said I would not be able to get a refund first because the ticket is non-refundable. He did not know that the cancellation within 24 hours after purchase does not matter the ticket types. I explained so, and he understood... He asked me to make a claim which expedites the process. After submitting the claim and getting a claim ID, I called a US office again, and she said I should talk to the one in France, which is the only office that can issue a refund. She transferred me to France, but they were closed. Next week, I called the US office again and asked her to transfer me to France as always. However, she said no. This was so strange because they always transferred me, but she kept saying no. She said that the only way is to make a claim again and again until I can get a refund. Now, the problem has not been solved yet.

I decided to use another flight company because I thought this company was unreliable through this problem, and they would not take any action if something happened. Each call literally took more than an hour to connect with someone, and I needed to contact the offices in the US and in France back and forth. I have never experienced such a complicated and slow process to get a refund within 24 hours after cancellation. 
If you may change, cancel the flight, or unfortunately encounter delays, or cancellations, prepare for the long process to solve it. Any simple process will turn out to be complicated and time-consuming matters.",2022-04,2022-04-12,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0
Travelling with babies/children: Avoid at all cost,Hamburg,St Martin / St Maarten,International,"Probably everybody agrees, that people book air france for two reasons: Cheapest fare for that particular date & destination; OR only (reasonable) airline to fly a specific route to a destination, which was the case for us with Sint Maarten. 

While in the past, flying alone, I would just bare and endure it, now flying with a 1 year old baby, the ferocity of air france really comes to shine: 

- After booking, it is not possible to book bassinett seats like on other airlines. 

- At checkin, you are not allowed to select seats like other passengers without babies. You are randomly selected a seat, which effecitvely is a punishment. 

- On our flights, the bulkhead seats for bassinetts were occupied by people without babies. People can pay extra money to book these seats. 
So clearly, Air France prefers making money over using bassinett seats for actual people who need bassinetts (=babies).

- No baby amenities and no baby food on board. 

- Staff really not children-friendly. A flight attendant even took the baby of another couple to ""show, how to bring it to sleep"" against their will. Any parent would understand thats a line not to be crossed, and can be pursued legally. 

- Paris Charles de Gaulles does not have baby buggies for rent. Anybody is aware, that Paris wins the award for most convoluted and gruesome airport in Europe, now have fun carrying your baby around there. 
Also, restrooms in Paris are not barrierfree. (At least in Terminals 2F)

After receiving an email early Dec 2021 indicating that ou flights were canceled and with the futile attempt to rebook, we were offered full refund after the most unpleasant experience trying to get a hold of anyone over the phone; over 2 hours + on hold, just to be told that the refund will take 3 months!!! Not sure why? But understandable.

We were issued a refund reference and were told to wait.

On Feb 2 , 2022 a refund of $24.30 X4 = $97.20 showed up on my Credit Card statement for the seats upgrade fees but the full amount was not included???!!!

Perplexed and disappointed we called Air France canada again on Feb 28,2022 and after a lenghty on hold experience we asked for clarification to why our full refund was not issued‚Ä¶. To my dismay and shock I was told that there was no indication that my full refund was submitted to be refunded and that only the extra seat upgrades were submitted.
How this could be happening?! the purchase was done at once...so why the refund is any different!
After indicating my displeasure and how unhappy I was with the way we were treated by Air France especially after being a loyal customers for many years.
We were reassured that the refund request will processed as soon as possible and we‚Äôre given a second refund confirmation...It is now April 4th,2022 and no refund as of yet.

And the waiting game keeps on going!

We are a longtime loyal Air France customers but can't help question the rational of being treated in this manner.",2022-02,2022-04-04,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

No consistence guidelines,Paris,Punta Cana,International,"My partner paid extra for a seat with extra space because he is tall. We ended up sitting curled up and ended up with backache and sore neck because we weren‚Äôt even able to stretch out legs at all despite the countless times we tried getting hold of the stewardesses, who respond was it ok even though we had paid extra. We were guided in the beginning as many other planes informs that we should be seated all times unless we needed to go too the bathroom. It is not like we weren‚Äôt cooperative since we knew there could be crying babies that needed comfort or people standing in line to get to the bathroom. Our line just got crossed when the fligh cabin ignored our call, or personally asked them to help to remove the group of french people having at chatty and taking up the space for our legs and people standing in line. 

We guess if you aren‚Äôt french then the flight cabin blames you for being rude and in considered. We are definitely not looking forward to going home with this airline company. DO find another if you are not french origin. 9 hours of being discriminated and being ignored is really hard and you end up spending more money on damages so you can enjoy your vacation with massages for sore knees, back and neck. We have already prepared our massages for when we get back.

The worst EVER !!,Tel Aviv,New York City,International,"I made a booking via Air France official internet site. I was charged immediately and got a confirmation. A few days afterwards I received an email with the flight details. I noticed at the bottom of the email a note instructing me to call  +33(0)9 6939 3654 to ""finalize the booking"". It didn't make much sense as I already got a confirmation, but I called them anyway. The representative said that there's a problem with my flight ticket, and that eventually it was not issued, and put me through to someone else who should take care of it. After waiting for an hour on the line (international call) I got disconnected. So I called again, and once again the representative confirmed that I have no flight ticket, and forwarded my call to whoever, and after another long wait - the call got disconnected. I tried again and again, kept getting the first representative to tell me that I have no flight ticket, forwarding my call, and no one answers. I tried to contact them via facebook and messenger as well, but no one responded. I filed a complaint in their site but it was ignored as well.  I tried to get the local Air France branch to help, but they insisted I need to call the one in France. This entire thing is absolutely outrageous. I made a booking via their site, which is supposed to be a serious and official site, they charged me immediately, and after they got my money - they cancelled my ticket and completely ignored me.

Our escort went with us to the pharmacy in the airport where we were able to convert our US vaccine cards to the European mobile QR codes.  Food on the plane and in the lounge was good, but not fabulous.  Service was not always there as I had to wander around to find a flight attendant a couple of times.  Lounge in San Francisco was bad, sketchy.  Lie flat bed was comfy, but the cabin was overheated and I sweated thru the flight.

I am not a giant at 1.85m (6'5"") and had limited leg space before on some flights, including Air France, but it was manageable. This time, is was just unacceptable. The aircraft was a Boeing 787-9 (B789).

Beware,Paris,Chicago,International,"My flight from CGD to ORD was delayed by 4+ hours due to a computer glitch on the aircraft. The flight crew then scrambled around to find another AF around the airport. All the luggage, catering etc. had to be transferred, and then we went back to the gate and boarded the replacement aircraft. AF emailed me explaining my EU rights to file a claim. So I did.
After four months of processing, they simply denied the claim saying, I arrived to CDG(here's where the delay happened) from a non-EU airport, which is not how the law states it. 
1. AF took over four months to process this claim. Unacceptable. The reason thy gave was, they were ""busy"". AF is not the ""most"" popular/busy airline in the world to be so busy that a simple claim can't even be processed in a timely manner. It just shows AF is unorganized or understaffed, or both
2. I'm a frequent flier and that was the first time I flew with AF. Wow, what an experience, not only was the flight delayed by 4+ hours, I got no compensation, we were not even offered any refreshments on the day. Dang! They don't really value/care your customers
3. Not to mention, both the AF flights I flew were old and dated

Nervous passengers, including my wife and me, looked at each other with great concern, although the crew said nothing. It wasn't until we retrieved our luggage at the baggage claim did we realize that the sound we had heard was the passenger luggage being tossed around in flight. The luggage had been apparently improperly secured. Our two new hardshell suitcases, purchased for this trip, were cracked and dented. The flight attendants on this flight were impatient and, at times, rude.  When I was finally able to doze off, while seated in the most uncomfortable airline seat I've ever experienced, I was awoken by a flight attendant who poked my leg with her flashlight to inform me that I needed to fasten my seatbelt.

Good interconnecting flight via Paris (second time!),Vienna,Amsterdam,Europe,"After having a rather negative experience with an interconnecting flight via Paris last year (35 minute lay-over, luggage got left behind in Paris) I must say that this is my second positive experience with AF-KLM. This time with a 55 minute lay-over. In general, it was a very smooth operation. I travelled with hand-luggage, but that was checked in due to the flight being busy. So when I arrived in Amsterdam, I was a bit anxious whether my suitcase would make it. And it did!

Leg room on board was terrible, though. It looks like Air France has limited options to buy  seats with more leg room, which is a bit of shame. A recurring point of feedback for both Air France and KLM is the food offered on board. While Air France does offer meat in stead of forcing a vegetarian option, the food in economy is terrible (as opposed to business class where it is actually much better than KLM!) I cannot understand why Air France (and KLM) brands itself as a premium airline, but has a sandwich is option in stead of a decent snack and/or meal.",2022-02,2022-03-03,4.0,1.0,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,4.0,5.0,1.0
Missing luggage since October 2021 - Still waiting for customer care department to get in touch Re Claim.,Paris,London,Europe,"MISSING LUGGAGE SINCE OCTOBER!!! Appalling customer service. Very disappointed in Air France.

I flew with Air France from Paris to London in October and checked in a luggage which never arrived in London. I reached out to Air France and after going through their usual procedures filling in forms, describing luggage content etc I was informed that someone would get in touch. I had to chase a few times and after 21 days had to contact Air France to inform them that I read online that after 21 days of baggage not being found I needed to complete a claim form. The gentleman I spoke to apologised, mentioning that whoever I‚Äôd spoken with previously should‚Äôve ensure that someone got in touch after 21 days. Once I completed the form and was issues with a claim number that was it. No more news from Air France and every time I tried to call for an update I was put on hold. Last month after waiting to speak to speak to someone for 2hrs the phone disconnected. I tried Air France messenger and was informed there was nothing they could do. I needed to wait until the claim team got back to me with a resolution. We are in March and the last case review according to the link I was provider was in December. 

Iam absolutely appalled by the service. Air France used to be a reputable Airline. 

All I need is just some update. I cannot believe they lost my luggage with very important items that I will

Worst planning,Bengaluru,Hamburg,International,such a horrific experience to travel with you. I had a flight from Bengaluru to Hamburg via Paris. The connecting flight was an hour diff. The entire process in Paris airport took more thn 1.30 hrs made me miss my flight. 1 star for such a worst service and planning.

Compliments to the air crew,Paris,Cairo,International,"I had a lovely experience on an exhausting day of travel. The date was the 7th of Feb 2022, I had just survived an exhausting uncomfortable 10 hour transit in CDG airport and was boarding on my way to Cairo Airport, all knackered and miserable. 
I got in my comfortable economy premium seat, that I work extra hours to book, since it was the most comfortable kind of seating among the 3 European airlines I have tried before, and was hoping for peaceful fast trip. 
our lovely host, Mr. Philippe Robaszynski, was simply a fresh breeze. He was so amazing in his manner, so engaging and light, that made me and my partner (and I'm sure the passengers in the rest of the cabin) that the air was full of laughter and light banter in the quick 3 minutes he took everytime he came around to service us. It really felt like I was a guest in his home, rather than a tired stiff traveller. The most remarkable thing about him, is that while he was managing us (the grouchy travellers), he was creating a very interesting banter, asking very nice questions and had a refereshing way of teasing us that made us respond and join him. His communication style was exceptional, before you know it, you find yourself relaxing back and actually enjoying the trip. 
Although Mr. Robaszynski insisted I do not need to write a review, but I told him I will certainly NOT listen to him. Throughout my past travels on various airlines, I have witnessed so many ugly incidents between passengers and airhosts, and dealt with very tense stiff bored ones that it made me feel that flying is just a tiring ugly business, no matter how much you pay. 
Until I met Mr. Robaszynski, I spent more than half my life mourning the loss of my childhood memories on KLM, when the air hostesses used be so tall, beautiful graceful and so full of smiles, I had a collection of KLM barbies that I played with endlessly at 5-7 yrs old. I would wait impatiently to get on the plane and chase them around to talk to them, at that age, my dream was TO BE an air stewardess. I used to think it was the most amazing job on the planet. 
Thank you Mr. Robaszynski, it was a memorable trip. 
And dear Air France, his style of communication needs to be a  standard, a benchmark, a reference to be taught. 
Looking forward to boarding your airlines back home in 10 days.

Terrible service all around from ground staff to on board service,Mumbai,Paris,International,"The A350 plane is great for passengers (comfortable and quiet).  However, the Air France service in Mumbai is sub-par at best and the service on board is not good either.

Mumbai ground staff ==> 
 - I was unable to check-in via their website
 - they weighed my bags at the check-in counter in Mumbai (no issues here) but they weighed by back pack and my carry on (Delta and KLM don't do this).
 - since I had 8kg more than their limit they asked to me to either pay $200 to check it in or remove excess weight.
 - I removed the excess weight but was still 3kgs over.  I asked if I could pay for the extra (3KG) and she said NO, we don't negotiate.  The Ground Staff Manager was very rude and unwilling to even engage in conversation.
 - In the meantime, they had the same issue with at least (5) other passengers yelling at them about checked baggage.
 - My inbound flight on Delta (DTW to BOM) via AMS had no weight issues for carry on baggage as they didn't even check.

On board Air France service ==> 
 - on board staff didn't even care for customers as they wouldn't even make eye contact.  
 - they served the first meal within (30) minutes but did NOT serve any alcohol.  The Stewardess said they don't serve it because it's too early and not served with breakfast.
 - 7 hrs and 30 minutes later they served lunch (nothing served in between not even a bottle of water like other airlines).  I asked for a beer and the stewardess in typical French rudeness said ""NO""!!!  no further explanation was provided.  
 - I was even willing to pay but that option was not offered.
 - Didn't want to pursue any further due to their rudeness.  

In conclusion, avoid this airline if you can.  Their codeshare partners Delta and KLM are far better.

Perhaps the service was poor because they didn't like serving a plane full of Indians.  Not sure but it's certainly disappointing that an airline treats it customers as a nusiance.",2022-02,2022-02-27,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0
AF Premium economy has nothing premium,Paris,New York City,International,"I flew on AF two weeks ago coming back from Paris to JFK in their premium economy cabin. It seems that this seat doesn't really have much more recline than regular economy. The cabin felt cramped and offered the same exact service as economy: same food, service and crew, no preflight drink, no self-service drinks or food in the galley (like on Virgin). Apart from the extra inches of legroom and slightly wider seat, this does not justify the premium price tag. Other airlines offer a true premium economy experience with much more recline and a dedicated premium crew and service. AF does not.",2022-02,2022-02-26,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0

Don't even consider flying Air France if disabled,Los Angeles,St Martin / St Maarten,Caribbean,"Through Delta, we purchased business class tickets from Los Angeles to Tahiti to take a Windstar Cruise.  My husband has ALS and travels with assistive medical devices.  We had called Delta and Air France to clear the devices before travel and had given all information and both said we were good to go.  These particular devices are specifically listed as approved by Delta and Air France had given their approval when called. .Our first leg from San Antonio, TX to Los Angeles (first class on Delta)  was great.  Perfect, caring service with attention to his comfort.  When we reached Los Angeles to catch the leg from Los Angeles to Tahiti (a code-share operated by Air France) everything changed.  We had a 7 hour layover at LAX and spent 4 hours being verbally assaulted by the incredibly rude Air France representatives.  We have never experienced anything even remotely similar to the abusive and humiliating treatment by these individuals.  Even though we had cleared everything and had a doctor's certificate, they denied our travel without even a clear reason. As the time wore on, they moved from one excuse to another, as they would drop one excuse and come up with something completely different.   We had maintained our cool throughout the 4 hour experience, realizing that you can't win an argument with an airline and might risk getting arrested if you try to argue with them, given their attitude toward passengers these days.  There was no legitimate reason for them to deny our travel.  I believe they needed two business class seats and they thought we were easy targets to bump from the flight, because of his disability.  I know there are much worse things in life, but this ranks up there with miserable experiences.  This treatment of a disabled person was unconscionable.",2021-12,2022-02-21,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE,Manchester,Havana,Caribbean,"Paid ¬£2000 plus for business class flights to Havana from Manchester on 25th January 2022. Booked the holiday of a lifetime for my 50th birthday in 2021 and due to Covid had to postpone the holiday to 2022. Between December 2021 and 25th January 2022 there were several outbound flight time changes then our connecting flight to Havana from CDG was cancelled until the following day resulting in us having to stay overnight in an airport hotel at an additional cost. We also pre-booked our seats for all of our flights which Air France cancelled so we ended up sat in row 7.
Pre-booked vegetarian meals for all flights however these were not available. 
No welcome drink after boarding - it took over an hour and half both ways to be offered a drink!
No menu on the outgoing flight.
Some meals were unavailable ‚Äì ran out of choices! How come when there are only 7 rows? Was informed that this was due to Covid
No vegetarian option  offered for breakfast.
Cheeses without biscuits.
Had to eat our meal at a set time.
No snacks offered.
No Baileys. Ran out of champagne.
No duty free offers
Was given breakfast on trays which we presume was from economy class 
Rude cabin staff ‚Äì was told I was lying about pre-booking vegetarian meals.
Arguing with passengers (US), a vegetarian was told to remove his veal sausage from his breakfast tray and eat what was left anyway. You do not expect this to happen in this day and age.
Head steward shouted at my friend when he had no vegetarian options for breakfast which upset my friend. He ended up having to eat bread and butter for breakfast.
The lounge at CDG was a disgrace and had no breakfast other than slop.

Bought tickets on-line but they didn¬¥t finish the operation and didn¬¥t informed me,Faroe Islands,Curitiba,International,"I bought the Standard tickets, the bank authorized the payment, I received the tracking codes for light tickets, but not the air tickets.

They told me to call, I called and I couldn't get an answer. I waited 30 minutes and was not answered. As the trip would only be in 4 months, I would try another day. Two weeks later, I went to the Air France website and it said that we didn't have any reservations. I called again and was informed that we did not make the purchase. We immediately called the bank and were told that the money was reserved, waiting only for withdrawal by Air France. We called the airline again and were informed that they couldn't do anything, they couldn't provide us with the tickets because the price was already 7000 kroners higher than before and that we would have to make a new purchase of tickets for the current value. Every time I called or texted I was told that Air France could not do anything to try to resolve our issues. I post here my indignation, for the lack of communication from the airline, for not informing us of the problems that occurred with the payment, with the lack of willingness and availability to solve the problem.

Awful from start to finish!,London,Havana,International,"This was my first time flying with Air France - we booked return tickets to Havana and the price was incredible compared to other airlines. We received our booking confirmation and thought everything was fine. The flight was fast approaching and I hadn't received any information. I went on the Air France website and saw that suddenly my booking was not there anymore. I called Air France (was on hold for 1 hour!) and turns out that due to an internal system error, the payment had not gone through. You can imagine the panic now, we didn't know if we were going anymore or not. We had to call Air France another 3 times (!!!) (also on hold for ages) for this to be sorted out. Absolute disgrace given that each time we called we were promised it would be resolved within 24-48 hours. And the cherry on top, was that when we initially booked the flights, baggage was included (which you expect with long hauls), but when they rebooked it, of course there was no baggage! We had to pay for this for both legs.

Another issue is that when trying to check-in online or pay for baggage online, there were constantly errors so we had to do everything at the airport. FIX YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE. You are inconveniencing everyone, and as a result we had to resort to seats that were separate from one another and hefty baggage fees.

Now, on the flight itself, I could hear some talking so I took my headphones off and saw that one of the air hostesses was having a full on argument with one of the passengers a few rows ahead. They were threatening each other as well. I have never seen anything like this and didn't expect such unprofessionalism.

Finally, due to the initial booking blunder, my meal preferences had miraculously disappeared. On the flight, they did not have a vegetarian meal for me and none spare (which really was baffling), and the lady who said she will go and check never returned. So on the long 9 hour flight I had to eat 1 meal of bread and cheese....and another meal of bread and cheese. Thanks so much.

Hard to believe,New Delhi,Venetie,International,"Finding the change to Ryanair-price-policy (luggage= extra, seat=extra) was already a initial shock, but it didn't stop here. Bought tickets , reduced my luggage (for a entire Work-month) to 6 kg  but paid for the longer part (Paris-Delhi-Paris) for extra legroom. Returning I tried to make web-check-in (ca 20 times at different times,  but it was refused all the time. Arriving from Jodhpur I was forced to stay almost 5 hrs outside the real Airport area because I had no boarding pass. The same happened when I tried to change my Rupees to ‚Ç¨, no boarding-pass , no change. Finally approaching the departure counter I found that my seat was changed without announcement or explanation. Naturally ""my"" place was occupied . The lady, which had changed my place brought me to the plan , after I had made a protest to squeeze my long legs in a normal place , after all after paying for it ! I agreed to sit on another seat , finding a enfant pounding my back for 9 or so hours.

quasi as ""good-will""-action . Asking the lady on the Air France Info counter to do so (after telling her the story ) she explained that would be possible, but I've to pay for it.

Overall bad experience,Colombo,Paris,International,"Yesterday Jan 25, we flew Colombo, Sri Lanka to Paris, a 10.5 hour flight.
Service on the ground prior to boarding was outstanding. We had a problem with the lab not sending covid-PCR results in time, and the agent called the lab for me and had them email results directly to him. He was great. That is where the good service stopped.
We were fed an OK meal about 1 hour into the flight.  For the next over 7 hours we were not offered anything, not even a water. NOTHING, and my small coffee cup and my wife's wine glass from dinner remained in the cup holder by the aisle untouched for over 7 hours. The flight attendants were pretty much non-existent. Many people around us complaining. NO excuse for this when it was a smooth flight with no turbulence.

Rude and Unpleasant Experience,Houston,Paris,International,"I recently flown with this airline and I am highly dissatisfied. The website to check in for my flight was always down or crashed. When departing from Paris, I tried to check in 24 hours in advance and the website would not let me. I kept checking the website up until five hours until my flight and decided to give up. I‚Äôll just check in when I arrive at the airport. I arrive a little over an hour to the airport prior to the scheduled boarding time. The kiosk would not let me check in so I walked over to the nearest agent and tell them what happened. They go on to tell me that check in has been closed to go find another agent and schedule the next flight. I told them I been trying to check in and that it‚Äôs not my fault. They completely dismissed me and said ‚ÄúOh well..do better next time.‚Äù So I go to another counter to try to find the next flight and they charged me almost $300 for a connecting flight. While I was busy paying for another flight, my original flight was delayed for almost three hours. I could have still gotten on my original flight and saved $300. Still could have been on a straight flight instead of a connecting flight. The agents were rude, dismissive, clueless, and complete b-words.

One person told me it was in Paris, others say the system does not tell them, others say it never left Miami. The most frustrating part of it all NO ONE GIVES A CARE AT AIR FRANCE about your missing bag. DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY.

Shockingly poor administration,Cape Town Central,Bordeaux,International,"Our family of four were booked to fly from Cape Town to Bordeaux on 12 January 2021, with a lay-over in Paris. Presumably as a result of new travel restrictions, our flight was promptly cancelled and we were re-booked on a flight from Johannesburg to Paris, with an added leg from Cape Town to Johannesburg. We accepted that, as these disruptions are common now.

What was unacceptable, is that Air France made the booking for the flight from Cape Town to Johannesburg without any serious consideration of the period it would take us to collect our luggage and get to the Air France check-in counter in Johannesburg.  We had no online option for checking in, which resulted in a mad scramble to get to the counter in time for the Paris flight. We made it, but many other passengers in the same predicament didn't, and missed the flight to Paris as a consequence. Worst still, is the attitude displayed by the manager at the check-in counter in Johannesburg - she simply couldn't be bothered in the slightest about the predicament that they had placed these passengers in as a result of their poor planning. She wasn't even prepared to engage, and simply walked away - leaving the check-in staff and airport security to deal with their unhappy customers. Exceptionally poor for an airline that prides itself on its supposed service. To compound matters, the seats that we had pre-booked and paid for, were simply allocated to other passengers, resulting in our family being split for the Paris flight. No apology - take it or leave it. Compared to their sister company, KLM, they are nowhere. 

So if you intend travelling between France and South Africa, avoid them like the plague and rather book on KLM. You'll be continually updated on your flight and receive actual service from an international airline that understands the business.

Air france lost my luggage due to putting on wrong tags on my bag at check in desk by incompetent staff,London,Bogota,International,"I had a a flight from London to Bogota colombia via Paris with air france.
 I take this trip annually and always use direct flights due to shortage of flighst and planes being cancelled in the UK I had no choice but to take a flight transiting in Paris france as there were no direct flights from the uk to colombia only via a few countries in Europe and many via the United States that were less then half the price I paid. 
 I had a bad experience once using delta Airlines while transiting via the states due to my luggage being delayed for a few days but eventually turned up at my hotel in bogota colombia. 
So inswore not to use them again and decided to pay twice the price for a ticket from UK to Paris to Bogota at ¬£1000 instead of a flight via the states would cost me ¬£600 but I thought air france was a reputable company and how wrong was I.

I arrived early as usual 2 hours as stated and no one at check in desk so fast check on the desk clerk weighed my luggage had the normal chit chat as some do  all do about why colombia and so on they checked my paperwork and vaccination status printed boarding pass attached the tags to luggage then the luggage sticker at the back of boarding pass as they usually do and was instructed to go to security at London Heathrow Airport.

Shirt flight to arrive in Paris with a 3 hour waiting time but the plane was late departing by almost another hour die to how unorganised they were at Paris air france.

Arrive at Bogota late in the evening almost 10pm when should have been 9 sleep deprived after a long journey of almost 20 hours at the start of my journey without sleep.

Myself and a few other passengers were told our luggage has not arrived and is still in Paris and that we should give a address of where we are staying and they will send it tomorrow night when the next evening flight arrives from Paris.

I told them I'm traveling in the morning I only checked out at Bogota due to the long flight and late arrival I wanted a good night's sleep before continuing my journey but due to this incident I had to extend my hotel stay.

I was given a reference number so the next day I thought I should go to the airport as they might take long to send everyone's luggage and at this point I gathered all my paperwork and to my horror turned over my boarding pass and realised that the baggage tag she stuck on my pass it's no my name the realisation of how this has gone sideways now.

Before you say I should have checked I mean seriously who verifies that the tags the desk clerk puts on your baggies is correct u less you have had a bad experience iv traveled over 20 years and he does of hours never once I have had to check to see if that sticker regarding baggage tag is correct but everytime I tell someone they seam to tell me that they check which I did hard to belive because we only check our boarding pass and to see what gate we are going to and no one turns it around to say let's have a look at this little sticker make sure it's mine I mean you just presume the stickers baggage tags come out the machine the same time the boarding pass comes out just like a self service check in so I can not think how she made that mistake did she duplicate the passengers labels and tags and out on mine or it was on her messy desk or its a big scam tk steal bags at airports I just can't nit think why boarding card is correct yet baggage tags is from a flight that's already gone.

So as you can imagine next day no luck nothing arrived they told me to do claim on line here starts another nightmare my online app for airfrance has my original baggage weight and tag number but im not sure if it existes in physical form as I have a doffirebt name and tag number and weight.

The customer service help line is useless and they are rude and they do not help and are not co.passionate the worse people I have ever encountered terrd in my life its like they hate there job they keep telling me try next day as they have no news and I should email and not call everyday I tried to explain the mistake they made and told them to late with tag number I have or the original tag number but no luck also I am online via a chat and they are ignoring me and do not answ‚Åπer and I also on email and they have no news for me everyday what's crazy is my bag has a tag on it with name and address and telephone number as its very possible its ended up in Africa Algeria to be exact as that's the tag number I was given so I emailed Algeria lost baggage and no reply Bogota lost baggage they said no news Paris lost baggage nothing if only there was a good persona with some sense that would just have a look at the pink rubber tag that has my information and call me I would atleast know where it is but I am now stick in a foreign country with the clothing on my back

The maximum compensation that they can ever give would not cover the cost everything was new I had gifts fir Xmas that I was bringing due yo arrive g later this year then planned I have had to go shopping and spending money on basic that was not in my budget 1.700 euros is the max compensation that does not even cover 2 phones as gifts I have inside let alone the designer clothing and bags o mean the more I think the more I become sick at hiw someone can do this and yet be so rude and un comuncative phone calls are costing me almost ¬£10 every time as its international calls and I really don't know what to do its been 5 days I'm waiting and no news from any of the outlets I went to the airfrance office at the airport and the women was so rude telling me due to pandemic there are many issues every inco pedant company is quick to take the money but when it comes to customer service they are living in a another universe far from civil people so she basically git rid of me I todl her please check the tag numbers atleast for the one I have if not my original but she said the tag number shows nothing which is impossible because over the phone they were able to see the name and destination of the tag number and advised I should email Algeria also just incase so again another's taff member lied to me from air france I now read reviews and think why I did not do this before hand and why I thought having a name like airfrance would be a safe bet I told myself I would not take any more transit flights but had no choice and now this happens I hope someone who has has a similar exoeriemce can shed some light or atleast read this and learn to take pictures of your luggage and the tags when at check in or even put a locator tag inside I mean it's easy to say all this in highnsight but when it happens  to you the feeling is horrible only you would understand if it's happend if not you can not imagine when I think back to hiw I weighed my luggage at home and as it was under 23 kilos I decided to offload my hand luggage and put more inside then just take a rucksack for a lighter journey and now looking back I don't even know how to find old receipts when I paid cash for things they want proof of the items I can only tell them and give credit card purchases but that does not cover half as most was cash purchases especially when trading abroad I don't have receipts for everything and the value far exceeds the max compensation and yes I have travel insurance so will look I to the excess on that but either way its the last thing I'm bothered about I just want some good samaratian to loom at my tag and realise that the tags don't match my hand written rubber tag and to call me that would be a miracle.",2022-01,2022-01-14,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
Good (interconnecting) flight(s) with very friendly staff,Malaga,Amsterdam,Europe,"My family and I flew back from Malaga to Amsterdam via Paris. Our last interconnecting flight with Air France saw our luggage being offloaded in Paris, while we arrived in Valencia. 

This time no big luggage issues, however travellers with children in push chairs be advised. Although we got a 'bring to the gate label' at Malaga Costa del Sol airport, we did not find our push chair at the gate at Paris Charles de Gaulle. The flight attendant from our Paris bound flight, told us that this service is not offered at CDG Airport. Also, our push chair was transported straight to the carousel in Amsterdam. Not a big nuisance as our two year old can walk himself, but when flying with younger children who can't you might need to take this into consideration.

Our two flights were very good. Crew was amazing. The food was slightly better than on our KLM flight and did include a meat option (as opposed to KLM). Still, for the ticket price paid the food on board should be better. Legroom was pretty good in the Airbus A319 (first flight) and fairly good in the A320 (second flight). Unfortunately, no economy comfort options with Air France.

Fraudulent and Criminal!!!,Mexico City,Mumbai,International,"I had a flight scheduled for December 28th, two days ago, to fly from Mexico CIty to Mumbai, India. About a week ago, I spent a good 40 minutes on the phone with a rep at Air France, going over EVERY requirement needed to successfully make the scheduled trip, including 2 different Covid tests (both PCR and antigen), myriad questionaires, app on my phone for India, etc. etc. Daunting, indeed, but I was determined to make it happen!
Well... I arrived at the airport, a good 4 hours ahead of time...got up to the check-in counter, handed in my heap of paperwork, then gave the agent my passport with my 10 year Indian visa inside of it (good until 2029.) The agent told me I could NOT get on the flight!!! Why??? Because, he stated, the Indian government wouldn't accept ANY visas issued before October 6th, 2021!! But WHY NOT??!!? I protested. My visa was issued by the INDIAN government, and it was good for 10 years!! Not any more, was his terse, unsympathetic response. I was stunned. I asked to speak to a supervisor; he claimed he WAS a supervisor (I didn't believe him--why was he working the check-in counter if he was supposed to be supervising the staff?!?)  He simply refused to let my on the fight. Shocked, stunned, disbelieving... I then asked to reschedule the flight, thinking I would do what was necessary, then, to get ANOTHER visa and get on a later flight. However, he claimed he could NOT reschedule another flight for me, because I would need to get a valid visa FIRST!! To which I protested, WHY was proof of this so-called ""valid"" visa NOT necessary, then, when I booked the flight in the FIRST PLACE?!!? You see the stupid, unbelievable, illogic of it all?!? Furthermore, why was it that--when I spoke to an AF agent DAYS ago--we went over EVERY requirement, or so I thought, and that person NEVER, EVER asked about my visa?!?!!?!? Shouldn't that have been the FIRST question asked?!!? 
So I left the airport, and 2 days later, called Air France to ask for a refund. After waiting on the phone for 45 minutes for an agent to answer, and then another 25 minutes on hold with the agent, I was told that I could NOT be issued a refund because I was appearing-- in her system-- as a ""no show""!!!! A NO SHOW?!??! Are you KIDDING ME?!!?!? I was livid, as you might well imagine. I asked for a supervisor--yes, again--and was told none were available. Clearly, I am going to have to dispute this now on my credit card and try to get a refund for the $915 spent on my one-way ticket to India. What a complete and total nightmare. Devasting.

Watch out for a Charles De Gaulle trap (or Air France),Paris,Atlanta,International,"This is not necessarily an Air france review, more the CDG Airport in Paris, as they were scamming everyone equally. I just happened to be on an Air France flight..

In the security line there was a special guy at the front of it who visually asessed you and your carry-on luggage. If he thought you are a good candidate for scamming, he pulled you over and made you go in a separate line, where your carry-on AND your personal item, which you were allowed to bring (like a ladies handbag, or in my case a computer bag) were weighed TOGETHER, and if its over the allowed 12 kilos, FOR BOTH, they made you check in your carry-on for an additional 60 to 100 euro, depending on your deal.

Completely appalled,Phoenix,Bamako,International,"First I would like to say that I have never in my life experienced such an incredibly terrible flight experience before. This airline is absolute garbage to say the least. We checked in with 13 baggage‚Äôs, most containing medicine and clothes for our relatives, and somehow, they haven‚Äôt been able to deliver us ANY of our baggage‚Äôs. HOW TF DO YOU LOSE 13 BAGS???!!! It‚Äôs been 4 days and all I‚Äôve had are the clothes on my bag and my phone. This is absolutely unacceptable and I‚Äôll be dammed if I ever use this airline again. Shame on them. Not to mention how useless their customer service has been in helping us get the situation figured out. I could go on and on about how terrible their services are and how careless they are but I‚Äôll just stop here. I will never recommend this airline to anybody and I am looking forward to filing a lawsuit against them as soon as I return to the US. Useless bunch of baffoons",2021-12,2021-12-20,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
Rude arrogant flight attendant,Paris,Atlanta,International,"I had to write this review immediately because I‚Äôm really mad at the way I was insulted mid flight by a male attendant. First of all, I had to book this flight last minute and was hoping the service is good as this was through Air France‚Äôs association with Delta, an airlines I frequent while traveling domestically in the US. Needless to say this will be my first and last flight with Air France. I‚Äôve never been treated this bad on any other airlines before.

It was lunch time and I was waiting for my meal. I had already flown 9 hrs from Mumbai to Paris and this was my connecting flight from Paris to Atlanta. I was sitting in an aisle seat on the center row (left side). They served everyone ahead and next to me but had to go back to restock as they ran out of food. Me and a section of people around me had to wait for a good 15-20 minutes while everyone around us ate. I was starving and went to enquire about when we‚Äôd get served. The woman flight attendant I spoke to assured me they‚Äôll be serving us shortly. I came back to my seat and waited. After a few minutes, I saw the male flight attendant on the other side lugging the food trolley and asked him if I could get a plate. He told me to wait patiently as the flight attendant on my side would be coming over soon, but I said I had waited for a while and everyone around me got served, even the two seats right next to me and I was starving. He very rudely told me they are only 4 flight attendants serving food and I should just wait. He even pointed to the guy sitting on the aisle seat next to me and said if he‚Äôs not complaining then why are you. I said if I‚Äôm paying a good amount for this flight I expect the service to be at the same level as well, but he just went on gaslighting me. I told him he was speaking to me very rudely and then he just started walking away saying he couldn‚Äôt hear me. To be clear, I never raised my tone or spoke to him in a derogatory manner, but he certainly did. I was shaken and reduced to tears. I didn‚Äôt expect getting this kind of treatment just because I asked for a plate of food after having to wait a while for it. The female flight attendant I had spoken to earlier came over and served me and on seeing me rattled tried comforting me. I asked to speak to whoever was in charge and she promptly got her supervisor. I told the supervisor what happened and she told me she‚Äôll have a word with the male attendant about this incident. A few minutes later she comes back and tells me the male attendant said he couldn‚Äôt hear me through the mask which is a straight up lie. He told her that he didn‚Äôt have any plates left, which is not what he told me. If he had to tell me that I wouldn‚Äôt have pressed further. The supervisor seemed to side with the male flight attendant and kept insisting that he couldn‚Äôt hear me. She told me she‚Äôd write this incident down anyway. Not sure if she will so I‚Äôm making a note of this so that nobody else has to go through this. The only person who seemed concerned was the other female attendant who came twice to check on me and helped calm me down. 

After an hour or so the male attendant came to my seat to talk about this. He was initially deflecting saying he couldn‚Äôt hear me, but then when I brought up the points I mentioned earlier he said I was yelling, and he was yelling back because of that. If I was yelling how come he couldn‚Äôt hear me like he said before? He was clearly contradicting himself. I mentioned I had come from a long 9 hr flight and I hadn‚Äôt eaten anything during the 3 hr layover which left me starving, to which he said other people also had long connecting flights and lay overs. Again, this is not how you respond back. He was still gaslighting me. He even asked me if I wanted an apology from him. I told him that should come from him genuinely and not in this manner. I told him I felt very disrespected with his behavior and then he said he didn‚Äôt mean to, they‚Äôre there to serve us and that he‚Äôs hoping the rest of the flight goes smoothly. I appreciate that last bit but to be honest this just seemed like damage control and not a genuine acknowledgment of how he treated me. 

Please avoid Air France if you don‚Äôt want to get humiliated like this. Nothing I did warranted the rude and condescending tone the male flight attendant spoke to me in. Nobody should have to put up with this sort of behavior after paying through their hard earned money. There are plenty of good airlines that make sure their passengers are treated with respect.

LAX to Toulouse - Great Experience,Los Angeles,Toulouse,International,"I flew from LAX to Toulouse (via CDG in Paris) on Air France. This was during the pandemic.

Secondly their customer service is the worst I have ever dealt with. I requested to cancel my flight to receive a voucher to book again. It says upto 7 days. Its now veen over 14 days and no communication has been received.

Their online service also is flawed. There should be a online chat service to deal with simple issues. If you are unable to help yourself, you are forced to call them which is almost impossible to connect. Waiting times over 45 minutes or they will cut the call themselves.

I checked       the whole itinerary on my Delta account and it       wasn't changed. I called Delta representative,       waiting one hour on the phone, and was told that       they can not do anything because there wasn't any       change and cancellation on my Itinerary.  I have       been trying to communicate Air France since then       with no luck. I talked to a representative for two       hours on the phone. She told me first, my flight       was cancelled first and confirmed again later. I       asked her to send me the confirmation. When I got       the email confirmation, there was the change       actually. My return flights on different dates.    She didn't realize that I       was going to Paris one day earlier, and have to       spend more than 24 hour at the airport with this       terrible COVID environment. Delta representatives       tries to help me but without cancellation and       flight change information from Air France, they       can not do anything right now.  I tried to       communicate with Air France with email, but there       is no email provided on their website or emails.       They want people to call and wait long hours . At       least a chat option is available on Delta website       which is I am using.

"I used to love Air France, they broke my heart this trip.",Los Angeles,Venice,International,"Air France was my airline of choice going to Europe.  Their service, the comfort of the cabins and even the food service was fantastic.

This trip was a complete disappointment.  The seats in Premium Economy were terrible.  The foot rests are not adjustable.  The recline is practical non-existent.   These would barely pass as economy seats on most airlines.  

The food service was the worst I have ever had on any airline.  Normally the food service is passable in the premium section but this time was a complete bust.  They served one meal and one snack.  There was no drink services between nor a galley to serve one self.

Extremely rude crew,Paris,Chennai (Madras),International,"I don't understand whether it was my travelling with economy class that made my experience terrible or because i am indian. I was travelling with a 2 year old and i had carried a travel buggy for my kid. Since it wasn't labelled they asked me to take it to the flight, which I did. Also let me tell you, the communication between the crew members is the least thing a passenger can rightfully expect but get ready to be disappointed as hell. One airhostess tells me she doesn't know what to do. I go to another airhostess and she tells place it about my seat. I was carrying a crying toddler. Once i reached my seat which was a dreadful journey in itself, i am asked to move to the front FAST to keep my travel pram. It was crowded, late boarding, crying toddler and the lady was rushing me to come to the front and keep my pram. It seems i wasn't placing it correctly and man that lady had the audacity to throw me dirty looks and asked me to correct the position. I was freaking holding my toddler all that time! Couldn't they have helped me? Also, i was wearing a nonsurgical mask but so were many of the other passengers including few of the business class ones, i was mocked and sarcastically ridiculed that i am not wearing a surgical mask. I agreed it's my mistake but i politely asked for a surgical mask since all the flights i travelled with before had a mask directly under your seat but mind you Air france will not provide you one politely if you DON'T BELONG TO BUSINESS CLASS. I was getting mocked while the business class passenger asked for a surgical mask and she gives it to him smilingly. I hated the gut of that lady and was burning inside to confront her discrimination towards me but i was holding a crying toddler. I just didn't like how she treated me or for that matter anyone who does this to a parent of kids. Show some mercy on us! 
Point no. 2: the same lady refused to help the 85 year old man sitting right next to me with a stretcher to place his luggage. He had few of passengers including me to help his way out.

Boarding at Cairo airport,Cairo,Paris,International,"We have finally recovered from the horrible experience we had boarding the Air France flight to Paris on November 24. It never was easy or comfortable in the past but this time was special in the wrong meaning of the word.

The flight to Paris is at 2:25 a.m. but the last flight from Luxor arrives at 8:15 p.m. Security would not let us through till 10:45 so we had to wait till then though it was getting cold and we are no longer young. The check-in counters finally opened around 11 and we could take refuge in the lounge. The worst part was the actual boarding: complete chaos, passengers pushing, shoving and nearly trampling us (COVID anyone?), pseudo ""families"" of 8 accompanied by ""friends"" given priority boarding while we stood watching the pandemonium though we were in business class (there were TWO entry points so no reason to exclude us). I confronted the man ""in charge"" to no avail.

Is that reserved to Air France passengers? Is that the new Cairo airport? Is that how they treat elderly passengers? Is that what all tourists are confronted with? Is that how they want to encourage tourism?

Poor and rude customer service - Incompetent Staffs,Kinshasa,Atlanta,International,"I am doing this review on behalf of my mother who is 70 years old. She cannot use the computer and does not speak English.
Sadly, Air France's customer service is not only rude, but incompetent. rude because they let a '70s widow starve all day and incompetent because they cannot interpret the new airline immigration policies. They don't have the right people or the right training in place.
An agent at Paris airport contacted me at 3 a.m. via WhatApp to let me know that I should call my mother because she would not travel to the United States anymore because of the new policy stated that only non-immigrants were to be fully vaccinated but immigrants were not required to be fully immunized and my mom had an IMMIGRANT VISA. Air France refused to let my mother travel from Kinshasa 1st, we had to go through a lot to get her on the plane. Then when she arrived in Paris at 5 a.m., they refused to let her take the next plane to the United States. The United States Embassy in Kinshasa had to send an email to Air France to let my mother travel. They made her miss her flight, they abandoned her all day without feeding her from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. until a nephew who lived in Paris had to leave work early and drive 1 hour to go look for my mother because Air France threatened to send her back to Kinshasa within 2 days. She spent her day on a chair and Air France asked her where she would spend her night! Really!!!!!!!
When the email from the embassy reached Air France, they quickly made my mother's 2nd boarding pass for her to travel the fight the next day. Her visa was about to expire, but thank God she arrived in the United States 1 day before the visa expired. And when my mother arrived here in the United States, she was made very welcome by immigration and her family.

The trip was extremely stressful due to the non existent and horrible customer service and lack of service on the airpla,Tel Aviv,New York City,International,"The trip was extremely stressful. First it is impossible to contact customer service. I could not order a kosher meal through the website and consequently was not able to eat anything on the flight. I could not add another bag. I waited 45 minutes on the line to talk to customer service and after being put on hold various times and speaking to someone with a horrible connection who I could barely understand in the end when she came back from hold, I could hear her but she could not hear me! After I was an hour on the phone with her! Consequently, the change did not actually go through for the flight but I thought it did. I was unable again to order any kosher food and the flight attendants on the flight were non attentive. It seemed like their primary goal was to ignore you all together and be totally unsympathetic or creative in finding any food for you. Also, I had to wait about a hour on my feet at JFK to check in. I was not able to check in online. I tried to contact Airfrance by instant messenger and I was chatting with someone and then all of a sudden the conversation went dead. When I went to check in, Airfrance told me that they had no record of me on the flight and the guy was really rude to me and told me to go to Delta Airlines and sort it out. I was really stressed and cursed to myself and he thought I was cursing at me and then told me to go to hell and not come back here to the desk as he would not help me. He was screaming at me and made me cry. I had to go to another terminal and the clerk there was telling me that I couldn't get on that flight and he was going to send me through Brussels with a day layover. I told him that the Air France clerk could not tell me I could not get on the flight when I had a confirmation just because he didn't like me. I think he was antisemitic.

Worst flight experience of my life!!,Tunis,Canton of Geneva,International,"I was booked onto a flight with only a 45 minute layover which is already difficult. The flight from Tunis was delayed which meant I had to sprint to my next flight. I had asked the crew on board if they could call ahead to tell the plane I was coming and they said no - I had time to make the connection (by the time the flight arrived I had 25 mins). I had to go through security again - a horrible woman put my bag through extra screening just because I told her I was in a rush and when I got to my gate (miraculously 10mins before the scheduled departure time) they told me the flight had already left. It was the last flight of the day out to Geneva meaning I had to spend the night at a horrible Ibis in Paris, wake up at the crack of dawn to make the first flight out in the morning and still had to take an additional day out of my annual leave to compensate for Air France staffs utter uselessness! Not once in this whole process did anyone try and help me, no one even apologized! The worst flight experience I have ever had.

"Standard Air France domestic flight, but could have been better",Nice,Paris,Domestic,"Air France Flight 6209
NCE-ORY
10:30 am-12:00 pm 
Airbus A321

We recently took a short flight on Air France from Nice to Paris ‚Äì Orly, and although the flight was generally ok, it absolutely could have been better. The flight was late for no clear reason, and the airport experience at Nice was very poor when we checked in.

We arrived at Nice Airport a little bit after 9:00 am for this 10:30 am flight, which was plenty of time to check bags and get our health passes verified before the flight. Although Nice Airport is a bit busy (not at the level of CDG, but busier than other airports in France), it‚Äôs not too hard to navigate, and all flights are operating out of Terminal 2 right now.

On a previous Air France domestic flight on this trip, we had received an email before our flight giving us the option to upload our health passes in advance so that we could be cleared to fly without having vaccines verified at the airport. We didn‚Äôt get the same option on this flight, which was unfortunate since it adds extra time to have to deal with it at the airport. 

When we arrived, we attempted to get our checked bags tagged using the self-service kiosks, which we had used on other Air France flights on this trip and were quite adept at using by this point. However, the machine refused to print out our bag tags, and printed out a plain piece of paper saying that we‚Äôd have to see an airport agent. We had no idea why this was, since we hadn‚Äôt had this happen on other flights. However, we were not the only ones having this issue, so I don‚Äôt think it was anything we caused.

At the entrance to the full-service line, there was an employee stationed there who I would assume was supposed to answer questions and help guide passengers, but he was totally unhelpful. He pulled us away from the line we were about to join and we showed him the paper that had printed out from the kiosk. He asked if we had checked bags. My wife and I were each standing there with multiple suitcases, and I said that yes, we did need to check bags. However, he somehow took it as a no, and thought we only had carry-ons. He then proceeded to check our health passes (in a very cursory manner without even scanning them for validity), printed out boarding passes for us, and told us to go straight to security. This was totally frustrating because it wasn‚Äôt boarding passes we needed, it was checking in our luggage. We already had mobile boarding passes on our phones. When I explained this again, he got aggressive and angry, and accused me of not telling him the truth about our luggage. He finally just dismissed us to the main line that we knew we had needed to join anyway. He had wasted our time and was totally rude and unprofessional. I noticed him treating other passengers in a very similarly rude manner that is not acceptable. 

We waited in line for about 15 minutes before getting to the front, where we were finally able to check our bags, which was quick and easy. However, the whole check-in process had been totally cumbersome, with the kiosk issues and getting stopped by the rude employee. It felt like a lot of hoops to go through to check bags for a basic domestic flight. Things were not well organized by Air France at Nice Airport.

The security checkpoint at that airport is quite large with many lanes open, so it was actually quite efficient and better than security we had experienced at CDG. Since Air France couldn‚Äôt get their act together at the ticketing area, at least airport security was better.

Our flight was departing from Gate A00, which was the furthest possible gate from the security checkpoint, and was definitely a bit of a walk away. We also noticed that the terminal got progressively less nice as we made our way through. At first, it had lots of nice shops, wide open areas to wait, and a variety of food options. However, once we made it to Gate A00, the airport looked much more utilitarian and more like it‚Äôs under construction. It was also gross that a smoking lounge was right by that gate, so whenever someone entered or exited that lounge, strong gusts of cigarette smoke came pouring out into the general waiting area.  The whole area had a stale cigarette smell.

As time passed while we waited for the flight, our boarding time came and went, and the tv monitors by the gate eventually stated that the flight was going to be about 10 minutes delayed. This was not our first delayed Air France flight where the information was not announced by gate agents, which I find totally odd. I don‚Äôt like that the expectation is that passengers will just find out from the screen that a flight is delayed, and are owed no explanation or apology. They did finally make an announcement at some point, but they only did it in French, so I wasn‚Äôt quite sure what was said or if any explanation for the delay was finally given. 

When we started boarding, it was a totally chaotic process. Because of the delay, everyone had really started crowding the gate while waiting, and boarding for groups 1 and 2 was not clearly delineated, so everyone just started pushing their way to the front to board. There was initially only one lane open for boarding, with one employee checking health passes for those who hadn‚Äôt been pre-verified at check-in, and it was taking forever. Luckily, a second employee did then come over and join him, opening up a second boarding lane that helped speed things along. Once we finally got through, we waited in a very long line on the jetbridge to board. It just seemed that everything about getting this flight to depart was excessively slow.

We had paid for exit row seats in the exit row toward the back of the plane, where it was a row of only two seats instead of three, with one of the flight attendants‚Äô jump seats being right next to us. The seats had an amazing amount of legroom, so the purchase was worth it. The only thing I don‚Äôt like about sitting in the exit row on Air France is that they do not allow any personal items to be under the seat in front of you at any point during the flight when you‚Äôre sitting there, which I have not experienced on any other airline. 

The flight attendant who was working our section and sat with us during takeoff and landing was very nice. She offered us wipes to wipe down our seat area and translated any announcements made only in French so we could understand what was going on. I was really glad we were sitting near her and appreciated that she looked after us well throughout the flight. 

The A321 is pretty large, and Air France‚Äôs version had a lot of seats crammed in, but boarding was just excessively slow. It felt like we were sitting forever waiting for everyone to get on, and then once the plane was loaded, one of the pilots made an announcement to say that we couldn‚Äôt leave yet because there was no airport staff there to operate the jetbridge and move it back. This luckily got fixed quickly, but all the general delays in the boarding process had added up to a 30-minute departure delay, not the 10 minutes that was initially announced. 

The flight was generally fine from there. We took off very quickly from Nice, and although there was quite a bit of turbulence, we made up some of the delay en route to Paris. During the flight, the flight attendants came around to over beverages and a butter cookie, which was a perfectly acceptable refreshment for such a short flight. 

When we landed at Orly, we taxied to our gate and ended up arriving only 15 minutes late, making up half of the delay. Bags were coming out at baggage claim basically immediately once we got there, which was nice so that we didn‚Äôt have to waste any more time.

Overall, this flight on Air France was just ok. On the several Air France flights we took on this trip, we never got any real sense of urgency or sense that anyone wanted to make sure flights departed on time, which seemed to be the case again here. Although the delay was minor in the end, it was still a bit late and it seemed fully preventable. There was also really poor service at the check-in area at the airport, which left a negative taste in our mouths. The only good part of the flight was that the flight attendant in our section was very nice and helpful, but that wasn‚Äôt enough to make up for the other ineptitude.",2021-10,2021-11-09,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0

Going home the French way.,Paris,Miami,International,"Flew Air France from Paris to Miami in Business Class. Because of heavy traffic into Charles de Gaulle international airport, I arrived quite late and just in time to check in. Check in was fast and efficient. Once checked in, I rushed to the gate, by passing the lounge which i had no time to use.
As i boarded this B777-300 series, first thing i noticed about the cabin was the lay out: this was a 1/2/1 configuration which is quite super nice for business class as every passenger has an aisle access. My seat was a single seat by the window, The seat is  your basic business class seat compatible with most airlines (see picture). The seat had a pillow, duvet, a hanger, noise cancelling headsets and a bottle of water(see pictures). A big screen, large folding table and control switches for the seat recline and bed mode.As I settled in, I was offered  juice, water or champagne: I opted for the champagne. Then a kit with a face mask and sanitizing towel was handed to me together with the amenity kit followed by a menu(see picture). Because I only had coffee in the morning,  I was looking forward for lunch. The contents of the kits are the
same, and they include eyeshades,
socks, earplugs, a pen, a shoehorn,
a cleaning cloth, a dental kit, and
two creams from Clarins. The menu had a very nice choice of food and prepared by top chefs in France. Air France cares about giving you the French experience when it comes to culinary cuisine. The selection of beverages was endless. 2 whites and 2 reds. My only critique when it comes to the wines, Air France served all French wines, I wished they featured and showcased other countries wineries. French wines are not the only ones in the world and certainly not all are good.
After take off, the service started with drinks and nuts in a box. Champagne
And still water were my choices. Following the drink  service, lunch was finally served.
A tray was handed to me with vegetables
marinated in olive oil and dill,
smoked salmon with lemon cream,
a salad, and a selection of bread.
Main course came afterwards and I chose the Fish( pollock). 
Everything tasted good and well presented by the crew.
When lunch was over, I decided to recline, go under the duvet, put in my headsets and tried watching a movie but ended up sleeping nearly 3 hours. 
Before landing in Miami, a snack dinner service was offered with a choice and again went for the fish( this time a hake fillet) which tasted very good.
Air France has at the disposal of business class passengers, a bar set up with drinks and snacks available during the flight.
Overhaul, I thought the service and comfort that Air France offers their customers in business class is quite good.",2021-10,2021-11-08,4.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

Nice and easy flight,Bordeaux,Marseille,Domestic,"Air France Flight 1261 (operated by HOP)
BOD-MRS
8:20-9:25 am 
Canadair Regional Jet 1000

This short regional flight on Air France from Bordeaux to Marseille was simple, easy, and on time, which is really all I‚Äôm asking for. It was on a smaller regional jet, but we found it to be comfortable, especially with extra legroom in exit row seats that we paid for.

We arrived at Bordeaux Airport around 7:00 am for this 8:20 am flight, which was just right time-wise, since we had bags to check and had to get our health passes verified before the flight. Bordeaux Airport is quite small, and doesn‚Äôt have all that many flights at once, but because of that, Air France staffing is also somewhat light, so things can move a little slowly.

We had arrived in Bordeaux on a domestic flight a few days earlier from Paris, and in that case, we had received an email before our flight giving us the option to upload our health passes in advance so that we could be cleared to fly without having our vaccines verified at the airport. We didn‚Äôt get the same option on this flight, which was unfortunate since it added extra time on this flight.

When we arrived at the airport, we self-tagged our checked luggage using the kiosks, which is pretty simple and intuitive, and then made our way over to the bag drop line to drop them off. There was an employee standing at the entrance of the bag drop line with an iPad to check health passes, which was a fine idea, expect that she didn‚Äôt seem to really be familiar with how to operate the airline‚Äôs system on the iPad and find and verify passengers efficiently. The process for each person was quite slow. We were toward the front of the line to see her, but by the time we were done, the line had gotten quite long. Because we had verified our health passes with her, however, new boarding passes were printed for us when we dropped off our bags, and they contained the ‚Äòready to fly‚Äô logo that meant we at least wouldn‚Äôt have to have our health passes verified again while boarding. 

Security at Bordeaux is not well designed, and it‚Äôs in a very tight area that‚Äôs hard to navigate with luggage. The line just has unnecessarily tight turns you have to make, and there‚Äôs not a lot of space for each person to grab bins and put their things through. However, the process was quick enough and didn‚Äôt have a very long line, which was good.

The terminal area in Bordeaux was pretty bad. There wasn‚Äôt much of a waiting area, although it was convenient that the gate was basically just steps away after security. Luckily, we only had about 15 minutes to wait until boarding began, because there was barely anywhere to sit and nothing in the terminal as far as food or beverage options. 

The flight boarded on time, and an employee came around as we lined up to put gate check tags on each bag, since carry-ons wouldn‚Äôt fit in the overhead bins on the regional jet and would be picked up as we got off the plane in Marseille. Boarding was generally pretty orderly, and although we initially walked through a jetbridge to board, it took us onto the tarmac to drop off our carry-ons and then we walked up exterior stairs onto the aircraft.

The plane was totally fine, just a standard regional jet. I actually thought it seemed a bit nicer than the larger A320 that we had been on for our Air France flight a few days earlier. I also like the 2x2 seating layout on this aircraft. 

We were sitting in the exit row and got a briefing about evacuation procedures before takeoff. As we had learned on our previous flight, Air France is quite strict about the fact that exit row seats can‚Äôt have any bags underneath the seat in front at any point during the flight, which seems over the top and I‚Äôve never seen on another airline. That‚Äôs the only negative of upgrading to exit row seats on Air France.

We left the gate just a couple minutes late, taxied with no wait to take off, and were on our way. The flight was short and smooth, and under an hour in length. The flight attendants did come around with a jelly-filled cake and a beverage during the flight, which is more than I expected for such a short flight.

When we landed in Marseille, we taxied to what looked like it would be a normal gate for arrival, but we didn‚Äôt connect to a jetbridge. Instead, we had to disembark onto the tarmac, collect our gate checked bags, and load onto buses to get to the arrivals area. The whole process for loading the buses was actually not nearly as slow and painful as I‚Äôve seen on other flights, and the place the buses took us was practically just a few hundred feet away, so it was pretty quick to get to baggage claim. Checked luggage came out pretty much immediately once we got there, and we were on our way. 

Overall, this flight was short, simple, and exactly what I‚Äôm looking for on a domestic flight.",2021-09,2021-10-23,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0
Avoid at all costs!,Prague,Mahebourg,International,"Airfrance we always try to avoid, just because the in-flight everything is horrible, but this time we didn't have a choice since few airlines were flying to Mauritius during the days we want to go.  So we bite the bullet and book a flight with them....  Note that the flight is in January and we are already having issues!!!

1) Airfrance online portal does not allow to book flights with babies, so you need to call to book the flight - fine, a bit weird, but fine

2) We book the flight and everything seems normal until we look at the bank statement and they double charge the card!  Note this is a trip with 4 passengers flying Premium Economy, so it isn't a little bit of money that is getting blocked - at this point we are annoyed but figured it is an easy fix. 

3) We decide to call during business hours which is till 8pm (as per their website) on Friday.  We sit on hold for 30 minutes and get hung up 4 times!  So 2 hours of a Friday afternoon not creeping into Friday evening are wasted - at this time we are going from annoying to a bit angry, but fine, they prob left early on Friday so maybe that can be the issue....

4) We call them Saturday morning, and after 30 minutes we reach someone, wooohooo!  So this is going to be an easy fix now, we just wasted some time, no big deal...  Well the customer service agent goes ahead and informs us that she can't cancel the extra charge because she needs a reference number from the bank... what?!?! - now we go from annoying to full on angry, this is their fault and now we need to jump hoops to solve it, wtf

5) We call the bank and get the reference, the bank took only a few minutes so at least customer service somewhere works.  We once again call Air France customer service, we once again wait 30 minutes, and finally an agent answers....   But guess what, she needs a different reference number, there are 2 and she needs the other one!  The first person we talked to didn't tell us there were 2 reference numbers!  - now we go from angry to furious!  This is now 1.5 hours of our Saturday + a lot of money frozen for no reason...

6) We now call the bank, and they now say that there isn't another reference number that they can provide over the phone and that we need to go to a branch... what, banks are closed on Saturdays!!!! - the level of anger is now super high!  We would cancel everything if we didn't have the hotel and everything booked... but even if we wanted to cancel, I'm sure they wouldn't be able to do it!!!

So now, we are trying to see if we get the reference number so we can get our ""stolen"" money back... Thank you Air France, thank you for being consistent!  At least if you are going to be bad, it is best to be bad 100% of the time...

anyways, to be continued.....",2021-10,2021-10-23,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0819906910132473
Just ok domestic flight from Paris to Bordeaux,Paris,Bordeaux,Domestic,"Air France Flight 7624
CDG-BOD
12:35-1:50 PM 
Airbus A320

On a recent trip to France, we took this flight on Air France at the very beginning of our trip after arriving in Paris on a flight from the United States. This was just a basic domestic flight within France that wasn‚Äôt particularly great. The most annoying part was that the flight was delayed.

We were arriving in Terminal 2A on a flight on United Airlines from Newark and needed to connect at CDG onto a flight to Bordeaux. Since only Air France operates flights on the Paris-Bordeaux route and United and Air France aren‚Äôt partners, we couldn‚Äôt book it all as one ticket. We arrived on United, went through immigration and got all of our luggage, and then made our way to Terminal 2F to begin the check-in process with Air France from the start. It was about a 15-minute walk between Terminals 2A and 2F, but all indoors and very easy to navigate. Just to account for any delays and the transfer time within the airport, I‚Äôd probably plan for at least three hours between flights at CDG if switching airlines and going from international to domestic.

I did appreciate that a couple days before our flight, I received an email from Air France saying that we could upload our health passes online to be cleared as ‚Äòready to fly‚Äô prior to getting to the airport, and wouldn‚Äôt have to show any documentation again. Since the whole pass sanitaire/health pass process is tricky for non-Europeans, we were glad we had received our QR codes and had them ready to upload. It was quite easy, and soon after that, we received an email letting us know that our health passes had been approved. When we did online check-in, our boarding passes had a ‚Äòready to fly‚Äô logo on them, which signaled to Air France employees throughout our trip that we were cleared to fly and didn‚Äôt need to have a pass sanitaire checked again.

When we arrived at Terminal 2F, we were a bit confused about where to go to check our bags, since all of the check-in desks were totally closed on the side of the terminal we reached first. After walking for a while, we finally saw that the other side of the departures level showed signs of life. We used one of the kiosks to print our bag tags, which was simple enough, but we were totally confused about what to do next. I‚Äôm sure some of our issue had to do with the fact that we were tired coming in off of a redeye and weren‚Äôt familiar with checking in for domestic flights within France, but there were also a good number of French travelers who looked confused and were lined up trying to talk to an employee to figure out where to go. There simply wasn‚Äôt good signage, either in French or in English, to show where to go and how to proceed once you had tagged your bag. 

We eventually figured it out, and just joined what appeared to be the full-service check-in line. It was also the line for bag drop, and we were guided toward another kiosk, this one to allow us to weigh and drop off the bags without having to talk to an employee. We‚Äôve never been to an airport where every aspect of the check-in process is automated like that. We liked it, but just wished there had been better signage along the way. 

Security at Terminal 2F is a relatively large area, and none of the lines for security looked very long, but it was actually very slow moving once we got closer to the security check. The staff at this terminal was incredibly slow, as were a lot of travelers, so it was a painful process trying to make it the last couple feet through the screening. I was also not used to the amount of times that you‚Äôll be asked to show a boarding pass during security in France, including right up to the point when you put your items on the conveyer belt, which is something we never have to do in the US. Once we finally made it through, it took even longer because three out of our four bags were flagged for extra screening. I‚Äôm not sure if there was something about our bags or way of packing that was particularly suspicious, but this led to some bags being completely emptied out, which was a pain. 

After security, we had a long time to wait before our flight, since the flight schedules had necessitated a five-hour layover between flights. Our flight from the US had arrived late, and the whole process of arriving in France and then transferring over to Air France had eaten up a good 90 minutes, but we still had lots of time to wait. I liked that the section of the terminal where we waited near Gate F55 was a very bright and airy atrium, although the large amount of glass seemed to retain a lot of heat, so the terminal was quite stuffy. The way it‚Äôs designed also seemed to create excessive bottlenecks and crowds near any gate that had a flight boarding, although it was otherwise quite peaceful if you could find a quiet spot.

There is a good amount of shopping in Terminal 2F, but not enough useful dining options. All of the dining was on a lower level, and it was just really tight down there, with tons of people crowded around and not nearly enough seating. We had planned to sit at one of the bars or somewhere we could get breakfast, but some things weren‚Äôt open and others had no space. We ended up grabbing a couple cappuccinos to-go and found a quiet space up in the main terminal area to rest for a couple hours before our flight. 

We made our way to our gate at the appointed boarding time, when everyone started lining up for boarding in the first couple groups. However, when the boarding time passed with no action, I finally noticed on a TV monitor that it stated in small print that our flight had been delayed and was estimated to leave 15 minutes late. I didn‚Äôt understand why no announcement was made to provide this information. Instead, they let us all cram together in line for a flight that wasn‚Äôt boarding, when the aircraft wasn‚Äôt even there. Eventually, an announcement was made to say that our flight was delayed due to a late arriving aircraft, and we saw the aircraft pull up not long before our scheduled departure time. Because we had been waiting so long and were so tired, the delay was even more annoying than usual.

At some point while we were waiting to board, a gate agent came over to us and asked if we would be willing to gate check our carry-on bags, since overhead bin space was expected to run out on this flight. It seemed like I could say no if desired, and I knew bins wouldn‚Äôt all fill up by the time we boarded in group 2. However, we said yes anyway, since we already had other checked bags to collect and the gate agent was nice. The gate agent only ended up getting us and one other group to gate check bags, which was probably not worth the effort, but she escorted all of us out of the regular boarding line and to a spot near her where we could wait for boarding to begin. She said we would get to be the first ones on the plane as a thank you for gate checking our bags. Although we didn‚Äôt really need to get on early, I thought this was a nice gesture.

The flight eventually started boarding and we got right on and settled into seats that we had paid for in the exit row. I was a bit surprised at the condition of the aircraft, as the A320 looked very dated. It just felt worn and old, and the seats were very thin with dirty and frayed-looking fabric. The aircraft definitely needed an overhaul. However, our exit row seats at least gave us plenty of legroom. I was surprised to find out that sitting in the exit row meant we could not have anything underneath the seat in front of us at any point during the flight. I was not expecting this, since most airlines I‚Äôve been on will let you have a bag under the seat in front of you if you‚Äôre in an exit row, as long as there is a seat there. Sitting in the exit row on Air France seemed particularly strict, and the flight attendant really spent a lot of time going over the protocols for evacuations.

Boarding the aircraft seemed to take forever, and I didn‚Äôt understand why the flight attendants were obsessed with closing overhead bins that weren‚Äôt full, which slowed the process down as passengers tried to find spaces for their bags. I would have preferred more of a sense of urgency to try to make up some of the delay, but boarding was totally leisurely and drawn out. 

We finally left the gate almost 40 minutes late, and took off relatively quickly with no wait. The flight was pretty smooth and simple from there. Even though the flight was only a little over an hour, a butter cookie and a drink were served midway through, which I did appreciate.

Once we landed in Bordeaux, we taxied for a bit before parking at a remote spot. Luckily, it was still close enough to the terminal that we could just walk in, rather than having to take buses, and it helped that stairs were brought to both the front and back doors of the aircraft for disembarkation. 

Once we got off and were in the airport, the walk to baggage claim seemed inordinately long. Wherever we had landed, the path inside had us going up, down, and every which way walking through the airport. It was quite annoying, but at least by the time we got to baggage claim, bags had already started arriving and ours were there within a couple minutes.

Overall, the experience on this flight just felt cumbersome for a quick flight from Paris to Bordeaux. It was delayed, the aircraft was old, and nothing in particular made for a great flight. We made it where we needed to be, but that was about all Air France offered.",2021-09,2021-10-21,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0

It is true. Worst airline EVER been on,Berlin,Atlanta,International,"Just to keep it short and clear. If you can avoid Air France at all do so. They are horrible. CDG is a dismal example of what NOT to do when making an airport. 

If you loose a bag don‚Äôt expect to see it for over a week. If they turn it over to a delivery service do not exspect to ever see it again. The delivery service will never show up and no one at Air France will care. You can not reach anyone by phone.  The phone service agents have no additional information nor are they willing to try. 
After reading a very helpful review online.  I finally went back to airport where I then stood at a frosted glass door and rang a bell for over 40 minutes. 
   After getting an agent from baggage (who was very nice)  he looked for the bag but said it had been taken by delivery company. 

The entire process took hours but I learned where delivery company was. I took a cab to the company to reclaim my bag.

Worst service ever,Paris,Los Angeles,International,"AF66 on September 30th 2021

Their lack of service, beginning at checkin and all through the flight was horrible.  Their lobby had limited signage and even less personnel.  The confusion was quite apparent as the people in line had to ask other passengers what the lines were for. Most responded with palms raised and a shake of heads.
I could go on and on about it, but let's move on to our flight. The boarding was forty minutes prior to departure,  which went well. Our business seats were comfortable enough and clean; unfortunately,  that is all the good I will be mentioning.  There were no pre-departure drinks or service of any kind.  There was even an announcement we were waiting for last minute passengers,  which messed up our ""slot"" with ATC and delayed us for an hour and a half. 
You would think at this point, all cabin classes would be getting some pre-departure service, but you would be mistaken.  
You probably can predict how service in the air went, right? I will wrap this up by saying we had drinks with two meals, tasteless food, and never a flight attendant service after that. My wife and I had to seek them out in the service area talking with one another.  After interrupting their conversation,  they said they would bring us our drinks....never showed.

Superb meal - Staff could be more friendly,Paris,Valencia,Europe,"The meal on board this plane was one of the best I had. Matching Emirates, that serve fantastic meals even when you're in economy class. Staff could be more friendly, though. Compared to our KLM flight the service was less personal. Also, when the plane was about to land, staff did not check if people had their seat upright and tray tables folded. I was reading and decided to fold my table myself, but if I did not I could've easily left my table unfolded during landing and taxi. Crew did not seem to care or could not be bothered. 

The plane (Embrear) was new, very clean and had very comfortable leather seats.

Unfortunately, our luggage was not transferred from our Amsterdam to Paris flight. I already had the feeling that something was wrong, and after a 20 minute bus ride to the plane I was quite sure our luggage would not be on board, since we had only  45 minutes transfer time, which is 15 minute between disembarking and boarding. This was a connecting flight, so this should not have happened. If the time window between interconnected flights is to tight for luggage to be transferred, it should not be offered.",2021-09,2021-10-06,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.1219191587249426,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

I was in the airport four hours before the flight. They opened the boarding i put my baggage then went to airport customs and i did all the airport procedures and everything was going well.

Even one worker at their customer service in Paris airport didn't want to answer me !!! They made me wait a full day in the airport to take the one of the next day althought they had a flight on the same day to Beirut !

I waited almost 4 hours because they had only one worker for their customer service luggage and we were at least 6 waiting in the line .
And not to talk about their baggage restriction rules ! Only 20 kg per baggage so i ended up paying 200 euros more just to have another luggage and overweight for the first one !

Air France not refunding money,Seattle,Paris,International,"II bought a fully refundable, 1-stop, international ticket on Air France on Aug 24, 2021. They sent an email on Aug 30 that the first nonstop segment had been cancelled, and they rerouted me though another city adding one more stop, making it a 2-stop journey. I called them on Sep 5 and, after again confirming that a full refund would be made, cancelled my ticket. I was told that the refund will be made in 1-2 weeks. Until today, Sep 29, I have not received any email acknowledging the cancellation or the refund due. I am still able to pull up my booking on their site, so it is not even clear if the booking has been cancelled. I have called numerous times, but most of the time I get disconnected after a message saying they cannot accept my call due to heavy volume. In the 4-5 times I have spoken to someone, I was told that the refund was in que and I will get a credit by no later that Sep 30. Today, Sep 30, after a 50-minute hold, I was told that the refund request was ‚Äòbeing analyzed‚Äù and might even take 6 months. The agent then changed it to 90 days. I asked him to send an email acknowledging that the booking has been cancelled, and that the refund was in process. He refused. I asked to speak to a supervisor, he refused that too. I have disputed the transaction with my credit card company, as it does not appear that Air France does not intend to make a refund at all.

Avoid if possible,Punta Cana,Paris,International,"The only good thing I can say about this airline is that the plane arrived on time. Their planes are so old that you feel like flying in time mashine. The things that are supposed to make your 10hr flight less uncomfortable are either not working (movies, music etc.) or almost non existent (onboard service). Food is barely edible, to get something to drink tou have to wait hours for stewardess to walk through the aisle offering water, soda or disgusting, warm wine. Definitely the worst thing about this airline is organisation or rather disorganisation at the airport. Damaged luggage is a must, but consider yourself lucky if your luggage arrived to the same country as you did - the same airport is a luxury.

By far the worst airline I've ever encountered,Paris,London,Europe,"This is the first time that I have flown with Air France. My expectation when booking the flight was that I would arrive within the time specified on the booking. 
However, due to the subsequent lack of coordination and organisation, I, along with many other customers were delayed by over 1hour and missed the connecting flight. This led to an 8 hour wait inside the airport, with face masks permenantly on. This delay  was of significant inconvenience and as a result I tried to contact customer services to ensure that I would have sufficient time to catch the connecting flight on my return journey.

However, for the  5 days that I tried to contact the airline, I was on hold for an average of 30 mins at a time with calls being terminated before I was able to connect to an adviser. When I was finally connected, I was advised that I may try and alternative route (to the internal flight) to connect to my flight back to my country . I then payed the extra money to get to the airport to ensure that I would not be stuck in a que as I was on my incoming journey, leading me to miss my connection. After a 6 hour wait, I was advised that I would not be able to board the flight.
I was left to navigate my was back to the entrance from which I arrived. Which took around 60 mind with heavy bags. 
Although I eventually managed to communicate the issue with a member of staff. The lack of empathy and honesty from the airline staff at the boarding gate for the flight  was astonishing.

Worst airline and people I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with,Paris,Tbilisi,Europe,"I will be avoiding Air France and CDG airport at all costs for the rest of my life. Their booking system left me without any notification that there was a delay in my flight, I was left stranded in Paris for 25 hours instead of the original 3 I should have spent there, I was denied boarding onto a flight that evening because I couldn‚Äôt print my boarding pass, even though a customer service rep from Air France told me that I just needed to arrive to the check out desk with my reservation number. I was denied. I was told to run back to the Air France customer service to book another flight for the following day which I had to pay for even though it was their mistake!!! My bags were about to fly off to Tbilisi without me until I begged the baggage reclaim area to stop the flight from taking off and retrieve them minutes before take off from cargo. Air France woman that forced me to pay extra for the next flights was just like ‚Äúif you want your bags go down to floor 0 and call for help‚Äù oh wow woman do you know how hard it was to figure out what you meant!?
I wasn‚Äôt even put up in a lounge after my original delay, I had to pay for my own hotel in Paris, it took me over 6 weeks and 7 phone calls to Air France to get anybody to read my claim.

Due to Covid we were forced to move these vouchers  again to this summer 2021. Air France asked to submit a refund request to KLM (refused) KLM asked us to submit a refund to AIRFRANCE (Refused).

All Borders closed, Travel ban, Global Pandemic, this company is a scandal, fraud, bad system , unprofessional, they grab over 3800 euros of my money with no reason why.

"Skip Air France if you can, they just add stess to your life",Tokyo,Paris,International,"Too long didnt't read : Air France is at fault and owes us money.

I wanted to let you know of a situation we are currently in. My fiancee and I are getting married next week
 I booked for my Fiancee a flight from Haneda to Paris online. 
Today she tried to change some settings and it comes up with an error.
She calls up Air France Japan "" which pick up right away"" to then tell her the payment never went through.
In a panic she calls me at 3am and i check my online banking and see the money was taken. 
I try calling and calling their lines once they open but keep getting the same message 
""we are sorry our lines are too busy and we can't help you"" then hangs up.
After 10 attempts i try the "" join flying blue line"" which picks up within 8 minutes.
The staff member tells me there was a web ticket error on their end so the booking never happened.
I have to rebook, i had to rebook at a much higher price AND they won't refund me for several weeks
The amount they already took or make any gesture towards the price even though it was their fault 100%

Air France don't take care of their customers and keep your money to make interest. Don't trust them.
I am still awaiting to see if my Fiancees plane will even take off after hearing all the stories with Air france.

The most disturbing thing is, Air France doesn't even try and help. They never called, sent an email or anything to warn us
about the issue that had happened. I kept my calm and tried so hard 
but in the end yelling is the only way to get things done.

I will be filing a complaint. The customer service is 0/10 and trip advisor really needs a 0 there, we aren't treated like humans. The phones, Twitter, Facebook don't respond. All i see everywhere is probably 9/10 bad reviews and once in a while a miracle happens. This is a rant because we are stressed enough as it is about a wedding and Air France just complicated everything. I can't imagine what would've happened if she went to the Airport when she was suppose to fly and be refused...

Horrible,Istanbul,Paris,Europe,"This flight, bad enough at 4:15 am, was shockingly bad for what used to be a premier airline.  The plane was a beat up old Airbus 318 or 19 that had no business class seats. Instead, they left the middle seat open and sold them as business class. There was no entertainment system, no leg room, very little recline. They have no right selling these for business class rates. They were actually sold to me by Delta, operated by Air France. Shame on both of them.",2021-09,2021-09-04,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
Take the Eurostar!,Paris,London,Europe,"I had booked my return flight some time ago, when Eurostars were limited and pricey, and I was planning to have quite bulky luggage to check in. 
So, here's the story! [Class: Economy | Frequent Flyer: Platinum for Life].

It all started with the original flight booked being cancelled and me being reschedule on the last flight in the evening. Online check-in would not accept me, ""because of the need for a document check"", which actually interferes with providing your seat in the PLF - Gov.uk being fortunately more flexible in its online forms than Air France.
At check-in, I am directed to the Sky priority line, which does not seem that busy with a few customers and 3-4 desks open. I'm waiting for some time when the staff member at the closest desk starts taking selfies with passengers (I missed whether they were celebrities, but surely that wasn't social distancing at 1 meter and with the mask down). After which he probably had enough of working, and came to me directing me to another desk where ... I kept waiting (a good 10 minutes despite hardy anyone being there). Eventually I get my luggage checked-in, and I am allocated a middle seat because ""the flight is full"". I inquire whether this is consistent with social distancing only to hear that ""this does not apply when the flight is full!"". I'm also told that the flight will depart from L (we're in 2E) but nothing else.
Once I arrive at the terminal, the Lounge has closed since 16:00 and the other lounge does not accept AF passengers nor Priority Pass card holders. I get back to an AF ""help"" desk (quotes definitely needed). All I'm offered is to get back to K (but these are different airsides, with separate security) and regarding the full flight I am told that they have this wonderful system that renews cabin air every 3 minutes (NOTE: a different answer from the previous one).
After a couple of hours roaming the terminal, we eventually get on board, where 'priority boarding' means waiting 10 minutes standing in the jetway. 
On board, one thing they certainly did not lie about was that the flight was full (bar perhaps a couple of business seats). 20 minutes delay ""to wait for more passengers"" and more on-board waiting in a crammed flight.
One cabin crew comes to greet me (with a 25cl water bottle), as they always do when you are Plat-for-life but I suggest that, while he is obviously at the receiving end of a complex dysfunctional chain, I would rather have ""good customer service with no on-board greetings"". The next announcement is that they won't be any in-flight service due to the Covid situation.
During the flight, as much as I could see, several passengers within my FoV took their mask down completely (without drinking or eating) or wore it on their mouth only. Cabin crew did not seem to care at all, although they were nowhere to be seen, since there was no in-flight service. 
Flight continues, and more chaos when disembarking where the old recommendations of maintaining distance and disembarking by rows seem to have gone overboard.
Overall, I am not convinced by their in-flight measures, despite the upbeat ""award-winning"" health & safety measures tone of their web site. Does air recycling work when people next to you don't wear their mask properly? Why you would have 1 metre social distancing throughout the airport and all of a sudden be elbow to elbow with 2 people? 
What would be even worse would be that the cancelled the previous flight for yield management just to cram everyone onto the next one in the above conditions.",2021-09,2021-09-04,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Appaling customer service,Copenhagen,Santiago,International,"I'm appalled by your customer service. In the first place it takes hours to get through to your desk. Literally hours.
Today, I called to change my flight since I have not received the covid-documents necessary to enter Chile. I made sure that my new flight was also Premium Economy. In fact, I asked several times and paid a difference. However, when I received my new electronic ticket I was downgraded to Economy. 
So I called again and again waited for an hour. This time I was told by a very arrogant assistent that there was nothing to do about it and that ""the system"" was to blame for the downgrade. I could pay an additional 600 USD or cancel my flight. Really????   
Why do I have to pay for an error in your system? 
I ended up cancelling my flight and will now have to buy another at a higher price. But it will not be with AirFrance. Shame on you.

When asked how I can rebook this trip, they said they don‚Äôt know. 30 more min on hold, they said I would get a refund within 7 days which still has to happen and they logged a software bug report about their website.

Good bye Airfrance. this is your end,Dallas,Cairo,International,"company is struggling after covid. their service level is 0
yes 0. Delta handled check in in Dallas, was efficient but cold. in transit air france offered no service. staff are not willing to help and rude.
there was no body at arrival. 
in my return flight. they just give me boarding pass for the first leg in my flight. they refuse to provide the second and the third flights boarding pass. I do not know why and no body want to take the initiative to help.

After trying for hours to contact them, their answer was they were unable to change my flight because I already checked in for the other flight they proposed me (this isn‚Äôt true, because I never checked in, I know how to do a check in, and I never done that) then the only solution after hours I was trying to contact them, was ‚Äú call Delta or go to the airport and see‚Äù.

Discrimination and Rude Aggressive Behavior by Cabin Crew,Punta Cana,Paris,International,"Me and my family (wife and children 4, 7 years old) booking number UOHQUW, 2 seats in 16 rows, 2 seats in 19 rows. flew on the route Punta Cana-Paris-Moscow
We have fenced 4 seats in different rows, taking into account the possibility that if the landing is not complete, then we will have the opportunity to get additional space for our children to rest, since in general our journey home took more than 30 hours. We were able to pay for just two seats in the front of the cabin. The rest were not available. Since AirFance provides them for an additional fee, despite the tickets purchased at the maximum fare and the elite Sky Team membership.
During landing at Santa Domingo airport (the flight attendant refused to introduce herself), citing privacy. I transferred three passengers from row 15 to a higher class of service. Why she chose these passengers I do not know. Thanks to this, there was free space next to our seats for
Opportunity to stay close to all family members. After finishing the landing, when it became clear that these places (15th row) would be empty, we decided to change from 19th row to 15th, where we were far from each other. At that moment, the stewardess (she refused to give her name) pounced on us with shouts in French and in an aggressive manner demanded that we return to our seats.
The motivation is that we have to pay for these places.
What was not entirely clear, since we
We have already bought tickets at the most expensive fare and we are not flying for free. She screamed loudly and waved her arms grabbing me by the shoulder, indicating that I needed to return to my seats. I have fulfilled her requirements. However, this situation brought me serious moral distress. Since a huge number of passengers, seeing such an attitude, the flight attendants considered me to be violators or not worthy of a passenger, and throughout the flight I saw a prejudice against me and my family. After takeoff, another passenger was transferred to this seat, who flew alone and his seat was not far away, and he did not turn to the flight attendant with a request
About the transplant. This was her initiative, in order to enable us to use these vacated places. On the face of the fact of discrimination against me and my family by an employee of Air France.
What is the meaning of transferring another passenger to free seats next to another family, I do not know. With the spread of COVID, this looks unsafe for strangers and reduces the Safety that airlines are saying so much about. When placing relatives, the risks are reduced and the requirements of social distance are met.

After takeoff, one of my children did not receive the baby food I ordered earlier, as it was given to another family who ordered 2 baby food when traveling with 3 children. I found out when, when communicating with the senior Cabin crew, at the expense of the current situation, I saw that at 18
There were 3 meals in a row, when there was only 2x order in the tablet.
For what reason, all the same unnamed flight attendants provided other people's children with food, while my child cried for more than 10 minutes because her brother has baby food, but my daughter does not. Explaining that the flight attendants decided to give your food to another child on the plane unfortunately did not help calm her down.
Also, several times during a long flight, I pressed the call button for the flight attendant. But no one has ever approached me.
I had to get up every time and go to ask for water on my own.
I ask you to understand the current situation, since the hostile actions of the crew are on the face of the direction to create discriminatory situations. I don't understand why a company like Air.France encourages such actions of the staff and does not care about passengers. Of course, under the conditions of covid restrictions, passengers do not have many choices of airlines. But this situation will end soon and not me and not my family will be the last to look at the possibility of Air France flights. Since all long-distance flights depart with a significant delay, which carries risks when connecting. Rough aggressive",2021-07,2021-07-29,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0

The flight was great. It was the management of my luggage that came as an extreme disappointment.,Washington DC,Munich,International,"I was originally booked on delta airlines to Paris with one stop in Atlanta. The airline notified me that the flight was oversold and asked for me to take the Air France flight directly to Paris and then to Munich. I agreed with the conditions that I was told that my luggage would be delivered to me the next day.

My luggage has medication in there along with a few high valued items that I use for work.

When i landed in Munich on Sunday, I reported to the desk fill out a luggage claim.

I called that following Tuesday to inquire about my luggage in which I was told it would be delivered to me on Monday. I was told that the luggage arrived at the airport on 3 separate occasions; all notifications different from what the online luggage tracker populated. Nonetheless, I called Customer service for the 4th time on Friday to explain that I was in need of my luggage because of my medication and work supplies, I was mistreated and denied the opportunity to notify a manager for Air France of my situation by a customer service rep by the name of ‚ÄúLuke‚Äù. He would also not give his employee ID number for me to use to reference who I spoke to so I can get the situation rectified.

I live 2 hours from the airport and I am single Soldier who works full time. 

I was satisfied with the flight. It is just the lack of customer service and attention given to this situation which heavily influences my choice to fly this airline again and also affects my confidence to recommend this airline to others. I am disappointed and still have not received my luggage. I am having to take time off my job to return to Munich to pick up my luggage myself since it‚Äôs clearly only something I am concerned about and not the airline.

I do recommend not to take a last minute flight with this airline as there is a strong possibility they will lose your luggage and you may not have it for a significant amount of time. This has been a huge inconvenience for something that seems so simple to rectify.

Even if there is anything more the airline can do, ‚ÄúLuke‚Äôs‚Äù lack of customer service and active listening skills made the situation worse. The whole idea of customer service is to establish a positive repoire and he contradicts that initiative for Air France. Please retrain that service rep.

Truly Superb!,Tel Aviv,Paris,International,"YES, we're back and this time we flew to Paris 'Charles De Gaulle' airport, and what a treat it was!

Air France flights  In and out of African countries are horribly serviced.,Paris,Dakar,International,"I was travelling for the holidays from Canada to Senegal with a connecting flight from Paris to Dakar. This is the second time in the past 2 years that I make this itinerary with air France. The one thing I noticed is the switch in quality from Canada to Paris flight compared to the Paris Senegal flight. Which I take as nothing more than disrespect and discriminatory treatment to the majority black African clientele. 

First, the plane is way older with none of the new technology you can find in planes going between ""developed countries"" with air France. The customer service is extremely bad compared to the flight leaving Canada to go to France, the Paris Senegal flight had a disrespectful crew who would not say hello to people had a rude way of talking to customers and did not apologize even once to the passengers for a 1h15min delay. The change in treatment was so glaring after taking their plane from Canada to Paris.  The food was subpar as well compared to the Canada Paris flight. 

As I previously stated this is the 2nd time and last time I am taking this itinerary with Air France. However, I want people to be aware of the discriminatory treatment of Airfrance towards its African customers. I believe that this behaviour keeps being maintained because not enough passengers take the time to call it our publicly.",2021-07,2021-07-06,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0

Warning - don't fly with Air France unless you're prepared to pay 3 times the price!,Gothenburg,San Jose,International,"It's a long story, but the main mistake was that Air France refunded my flight from Costa Rica one day before I was supposed to go home and then made me pay 3 times the price for the new ticket for the same flights. Super stressful and expensive!! 

I understand that their customer service can be hard to reach during this time, but the unwillingness to admit they made a mistake and compensate for it gives the impression they don't care at all about their customers!

On top of this they asked me for my PCR-test before the boarding of the flight. I had to inform them that as a Swedish citizen I didn't need one for entry to Sweden. 
So make sure you check up on what documents you need by yourself, since they have no clue. Otherwise that would have been another stressful and expensive experience.",2021-06,2021-07-01,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0

They didn't hold the onward flight or had sold our seats. Had to stay in Paris overnight, which was a real pain. It seemed we weren't alone. Air France did pay for the room and a ""buffet"" dinner, which didn't appeal and no breakfast. So we spent quite a lot of our own cash on food and drink. 
CDG Airport has won awards, but it's a nightmare to get out and in and transferring means you have to go back through Customs and a fresh baggage search. They're pretty picky!

"Can't book a flight without the ""Back Office""",Boston,Milan,International,"For over 2 weeks we have tried to book a vacation flight with Air France.  They have changed their process. When you call, you speak to a rep who has little access to prices for flights.  They tell you what is available, then they need to send it up to the ""back office"" to get a price.  We booked a flight to Milan through Paris.  Several days later it was canceled.  We called to rebook. They gave us a price and were told that we would be notified with a confirmation on our new flight in 48 hours.  7 days later, no notification.  We called back and were told that it was never really confirmed, since the back office never notified us.  NOW the flight is $1400 MORE than what they quoted us.  We hung up, thought about it and then called the next day.  NOW the flight was $2800 MORE than the flight that had been cancelled.

We requested a total cancellation and refund online.  2 days later, we have still not received any confirmation of our request, which, once approved will take 40-90 days!!!!!!!!!!

In addition, the representative was very hard to understand  She kept breathing into her microphone, there was background noise, and every sentence was ended with a singsong voice tic of  Hmmm, uhuhuhuh, Mmmmm.  It often cut off what we were saying.  

This is so disappointing.  We have flown Air France in the past with no issues at all.  Now, it seems like they are flex pricing. Prices change constantly.  This whole ""back office"" process is impossible to deal with because you won't know what your flight will cost until 3-5 or more days later.

We have called them at least 5 times.  One call lasted 45 minutes with no progress.  if their wait time is more than 30 minutes, they simply disconnect your call.

WORST HUMAN BEINGS EVER,New York City,Paris,International,And didn‚Äôt even personally happen to me. I was just on FaceTime with my sister when this was all going down. The check-in crew for Airfrance flight AF007 departing at 18:45 have got to be some of the biggest A holes. My sister was trying to come to France with approved documentation (I had even just got off the phone with the consulate myself after all this happened and they confirmed that these people had no clue what they were talking about) when they denied my sister boarding to her flight. They even told her to ‚ÄúGet out of line.‚Äù Threatened her that she will not be getting her money back and even went as far as covering up their name nags in order to not get in trouble. And I repeat I was on the phone the entire time!! When I tried speaking to the man about what extra documentation he was looking for he couldn‚Äôt even tell us!!!!! When my sister went back up to the desk a second time to explain that she had everything correct he couldn‚Äôt even remember her name and didn‚Äôt remember exactly what documentation he looked at already but yet somehow thinks he has the authority to deny a person entry to a country he isn‚Äôt even a citizen of! The whole thing is a mess and thank goodness for the French consulate who is trying to help us sort out this mess but my God what a group of complete idiots! And did I mention the lack of empathy? My poor sister was crying her heart out and they didn‚Äôt even offer her a flight home (this was her connecting flight from Detroit) or even where she could go to stay despite her telling this she didn‚Äôt know New York and had never been.

No or low COVID MEASURES,London,Malaga,Europe,"The COVID measures taken by Air France (flight AF1381)  were completely unsatisfactory.

This was an early morning flight (6am from Heathrow to Paris), I was 45mins early at the gate to make sure I do not miss any extra COVID measures taken.

On my earlier flight with BA (Spain to UK) they had boarded passengers in 3 seperate lines at the gate depending on the row #, from the back to the front of the plane, to avoid extra jams and crowds in the plane.

Not so with Air France.

At the boarding there was no whatsoever priority or attention given to avoid jamming and crowding of passengers. At the gate all passengers were standing in one long queue regardless of row number. on my ticket there was a zone # given, but no zones were called for boarding priority.

This had lead to HUGE jams and crowds in the plane, when people were stowing their luggage into the compartments above the seats, looking for their seats, some were going back and for.
 
I was sitting at an aisle seat when an elderly couple wanted to sit at a close by row. some other passenger had by mistake taken one of their seat. then they started to unload their luggage when changing their seats. the couple had one large suitcase which did not fit, two fellow passangers stood up to help them - suddenly a huge crowd of people everyone talking and shuffling aroud for 10-15 minutes until everyone got their seat.

During the whole onboarding process there was no Air FRANCE staff to be seen to help in any way, no announcements given that could have instructed passengers. 

The crew standing at the door could have spotted the big suitcases and helped to stow them away in the front of the plane to avoid the mess in the plane. 
Also I remember from the past, very often crew members were usually helping passengers to organize the compartment space, not so with this Air France flight.

In summary, a VERY UNPLEASANT experience during COVID times. Why this airline can not take the same measures as others. 
As earlier mentioned 2 weeks ago I took BA flight to UK, were everything was well organized to avoid crowding at any time of the flight.

I will avoid Air France going forward.",2021-04,2021-04-24,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0

A DISASTER!,Canton of Geneva,Kansas City,International,"We arrived 2 hours and 20 minutes before the departure of pur flight Geneva-Kansas City (via Paris and Detroit) and the Geneva‚Äôs airport was almost empty. Almost empty except for the Air France/KLM counters where the line and the waiting time was very long. We thought that was related with the Covid-19 situation and waited patiently our moment for the check-in.
When we arrived at the the counter they asked us three documents: ESTA, marriage documents (we are an American-Swiss couple) and a PRC Covid-19 negative test. We had all three documents and the lady at the counter, very slow but polite, told us that the ESTA wasn‚Äôt valid and we have to see with the person in charge. The ESTA was valid till October 2021. So we waited again and, less than one hour before departure, we look with the person in charge of this kind of problems (Anne) that called Paris to ‚Äúforced the system‚Äù. She couldn‚Äôt find a solution and tell us to go to an other counter to book an other flight because it wasn‚Äôt possible for us to get on the plane. We were shocked! To be honest we get really nervous, we had 30 minutes to go through the security and reach the gate, and we explained that wasn‚Äôt our fault because we had all the documents requested. That was impossible that we gonna miss the flight because Air France had a problem to enter the ESTA informations. The ESTA still valid and they verify that directly on the website of the American government. The women at the counter told us ‚Äúyou have to calm down because isn‚Äôt my fault, I call Paris and they can do nothing, I already finish my day and still here to speak with you...‚Äù. When we told her that was her job to get us on a airplane after we paid big money, do all the stuff requested and be polite (we probably get angry but we didn‚Äôt insult anyone)... SHE LEFT THE COUNTER AND GO HOME! WITHOUT TELLING US WHAT TO DO!
And other Air France/KLM employee came and called an other office in Paris and they find a way to get us the boarding pass for the first step of our flight (just from Geneva to Paris) telling us to see with their colleagues in Paris! Of course the solution was possible but zero apologies. This 10 minutes before the gate close.
Extra big surprise we had to pay for our checked luggage even if we spoke with Delta (we bought the tickets via Delta‚Äôs website) and they assured us about a first checked luggage for free... we don‚Äôt know if the problem come from Delta or Air France but we didn‚Äôt have time to complain we had 10 minutes to pay, go through security and run to the gate...
Arrived in Paris CDG we tried to find a Customer Service in the terminal 2 E (K). We found three counters and just one had a person from Air France. We wait on the line (three people) and she told us ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry but is my lunch break... but you can find someone to the other Customer Service‚Äù. We walk again to the other counter and... the desert! No one showed up for 45 minutes! Not one on three Customer Service counters! In Paris CDG airport! Insane! We finished to go to the gate without boarding passes for the Swiss citizen... the American person get the boarding pass at the Air France Lounge! Air France Lounge!
When they open our gate we went there to receive the boarding passes but... but they told us that was impossible to get on the flight because the ESTA number, also if it was valid for the American government! The women at the counter ask us to calm down and go somewhere else to find a solution! This even before we began to get nervous! We literally lost our aplomb and began to tell her to do their job and find a solution. Nothing! She didn‚Äôt care at all just repeating ‚Äúis not our fault‚Äù when was clearly their system fault! 
We were lucky because someone of the US Embassy was there and come to help us explaining to Air France staff that for the American government also the Swiss person had the right to catch the flight and enter the USA. He asked to call someone to find a solution (using his name and position). Very slowly, while the other passengers were waiting in the bus, they do some calls and find a solution to get us the boarding passes and get on the plane. Again... no apologies! Nothing... Just looked us like we were a problem!
Just to finish the story we arrived in the USA and we had zero problems to pass the border controls and get the stamp on the passport in less than 5 minutes!
We can understand that is a stressful job in a stressful time but it‚Äôs a shame for a company like Air France. No help, no solutions, bad attitude, no apologies, lie over lie, bad service,... A DISASTER! After this flight we really hope to don‚Äôt have to flight anymore with Air France! What a shame!

The WORST Airline ever!,Nice,San Jose,International,"Definitely The WORST Airline ever!
We had flights Nice - Costa Rica, onwards was lovely as it was carried via Copa Airlines. Return flights however... were delayed for 2 days (!!), then Costa Rica to Paris was delayed for 1,5 hours, in which case we nearly missed (meaning literally in minutes) our next flight back home, no assistance  what so ever, nobody cared! As I was running breathless, reached to boarding desk, flight attendants asked how far my husband is (with carrying all the baggages), 'if he's far, we can't wait' (?!). Finally arrived to Nice, our luggage was disappeared! We made a claim, which took us another 1,5h. Luggage arrived day after, BROKEN, in which case we also missed our work documents for the presentation, we needed to cancel on the same day. Now, making claim regarding 2 day delay, I was obviously given most convinient answer 'due COVID', as not to pay compensation. I filed claims, which were closed immediately, with no response, as I was asking proof of the delay, because air carrier is obligated to give proof of flight cancellation or delay, to the passengers - Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 art.5. p.4
In case they don't have valid proof, air carrier needs proceed with the compensation according to Regulation (EEC) No 295/91",2021-02,2021-04-14,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
Worst experience with air france airlines booking,Bengaluru,Raleigh,International,"Would have given negative ratings if available. Had worst experience with air france along with many other travellers. We had all booked flights from bangalore to USA. And we were denied boarding the flight saying some covid-19 restrictions. But they allowed one F1 candidate not sure how come only F1 are immune to covid-19. Also air france could have asked the visa details in advance while booking the tickets and denied the booking but no, they allowed us to book the tickets. And then a day prior to the travel just sent an email saying check your eligibility, it was very late for passengers to do any alternative planning and many were not even sure how to properly check the eligibility. Most of us had come from far away places and reached bangalore with heavy luggages, booked hotels, cabs  , got the necessary negative covid-19 report and finally when we were at the air france counter we were denied boarding and they did not even help us with some alternative flights or arrangements. They just kept saying that they are doing their job. As per us the correct job that air france could have done is that they shouldn't have taken the booking or if it's so important then should have got the visa details well in advance while booking and should have rejected the booking. Or should have informed the passengers well in advance instead of informing a day ahead. On top of that they said talk to customer care for refund and we can't help with that here as well. Overall my experience was worst with air france and I will not be willing to travel with them again and I would suggest all others to be very cautious if you choose air france.",2021-04,2021-04-10,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

No one had a clue what this was so rang around all day finding a myriad of departments without clue so I got the PCR done on 4th.
That evening returning home England went in to lockdown on late night news.

Incompetent,Stockholm,Manchester,Europe,"I used to fly with Air France many times and never had any issues until today. I am polish living and working in U.K. with settlement status. My job require me to travel a lot and I‚Äôve been traveling extensively during COVID. I arrived to the airport 2 hours before departure. Because of the COVID I had to wait 50min which is understandable. Then it was my turn...I‚Äôm handing my passport, she checking it and here how our conversation goes:
- I can‚Äôt find you on the system, under what name did you book your ticket?
- I didn‚Äôt book the ticket, it was booked by travel agent but it is under my name...let me check confirmation...
I‚Äôm handing over my phone with flight booking - she is clearly confused. Then she is waiting for her colleague to help her...after 2 min
- ok, I found your name but I can‚Äôt check you in
- what do you mean you can‚Äôt check me in?
- I‚Äôm not sure why...let me ask
Again, she is waiting for colleague to help her...
Then she‚Äôs starting going through my passport...
- where is your visa?
- what visa?
- you need a visa to enter U.K.
- I don‚Äôt need a visa, I have settled status
- what is settled status?
- it means that I can live and work in U.K.
- have you got anything to prove it
- I don‚Äôt need anything to prove it to you, I can enter using my passport
She is clearly lost
- I need to ask my supervisor - supervisor comes...
They both reading what I need to enter U.K.
After a moment supervisor:
- do you have anything to prove your settled status..
I‚Äôm completely off guard...taking my phone and logging to immigration website and showing proof of my settled status.
Supervisor:
- you need to print it. Go to ticket office and they will print it for you...
- are you sure that I need to print it?
- yes, that‚Äôs what system says
I‚Äôm going to the ticket office and there is a queue...so in the meantime checked on internet if I need anything and the answer is no. To make sure, I called Manchester airport immigration helpline, they confirmed that I don‚Äôt need to print anything and can enter using my passport.
So I‚Äôm heading back to check in...
- I just had a chat with Manchester immigration office and they saying that I don‚Äôt need to print anything
Supervisor:
- system is saying that you need to print it and this is the newest update so it‚Äôs right.
Now I‚Äôm annoyed...
- last time I checked British boarder force was following British law and guidelines not Air France 
They didn‚Äôt like this comment but at least they shut up and started reading what system actually says:
After couple of minutes supervisor says:
- you need locator form
- I‚Äôve got it - handing over my phone
- you need to print it
- I don‚Äôt need to print it, I‚Äôve been entering U.K. multiple times in the last few months and never printed it
- it obviously changed since last time
So I quickly checked on the gov site which confirmed that I can have it on my phone
- British gov site says that I don‚Äôt need to print it
This is where supervisor got really annoyed.
- look, I don‚Äôt care what some website says, you need to print it...I can print it for you or not?
- whatever...

"Choose another airline, drive, get a boat, walk... anything but use this airline",Dubai,Paris,International,"Flew with them for the first time and it was a 7 hour flight. The whole time every single cabin crew seemed like they wanted no one on the plane. But the plane was jam packed. Zero leg room, tiniest of aisles, it was very cramped and you would have thought due to covid they would have reduced the number of seats available to keep people spread apart. But no, I might as well have been cuddling the person next to me. 

Crew were the rudest people I have ever met, dealt with a few French people recently and it seems to be common that they are brought up with no manners. They should think about hiring staff who know how to crack a smile and let you go to the toilet. Tried to get past them whilst they were serving, not the ideal time but I needed to go... plus I have seen many people go during service, and the crew kindly move down to an empty seat so you can get past and they can carry on.

They didn't even acknowledge my existence. And when I asked to get past the woman just said I am serving go away. Then the other one came right up behind me and asked me to move out the way, not grasping the concept of me standing there thinking they would realise that I needed the toilet. 

When I eventually got past and went, I came out and another member of staff walking straight into me and didn't apologise. 

The way they spoke to people was disgusting. All rude, ignorant and don't care about anyone on the flight.  Considering I flew with Emirates on the way out there, the difference in service, manners and attitude towards passengers  is massive. I expected similar flying long haul with these but they clearly can't be bothered learning how to do it properly.

Aside from that, the food was awful,your packed in there like sardines and can't move, the in flight entertainment is basic to say the least and once again the crew are rude, miserable, unhappy and terrible at their jobs.

Despite of just 8 passengers in the Business cabin and have been asked as third passenger for selection, the chosen meal was not available (""since too many have selected it..."") so I have not taken any...My colleague in the same cabin was served with the wrong versus selection.
After a single glas wine the empty glas was removed by the staff wile passing by without asking for additional wishes; and slow reaction after call...There was the impression that the crew was rushing and focused for quick completion of the service for getting rest soon...All in all a frustrating experience after a heavy working week, which I don't wish to repeat!",2021-01,2021-02-02,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,3.0
"Fine in the air, terrible at the airports",Paris,Cairo,International,"CDG-CAI Dec. 25: check-in perfect, security awful: no priority lane, male attendant rude and brutal (we made a complaint at the AF lounge), boarding chaotic, passengers huddled together, no distancing, we had to tell the ground crew to organize lines. Flight was pleasant, steward not so attentive, thinking his own thoughts. Stewardesses very pleasant.

CAI-CDG Jan. 27: check-in horrible. The male attendant was very, very unpleasant though we were the only business class passengers, demanded proof my Swiss WIFE could live in France (!!!!!!!!!), demanded to check and recheck our PCR tests though we saw SEVERAL passengers were allowed to board without a test (we saw them sent to testing facilities when we arrived in CDG--some people are more equal than others). AF should sack their staff in Cairo ASAP. No lines for passport control. Lounge comfortable and quiet--no alcohol--food O.K. Boarding was very easy (88 passengers on a 777-300). The stewardesses were perfect--we were alone in the cabin. Champagne before take-off. No dinner, only breakfast. We landed early, our luggage came when we reached the carrousel.

Ground crews are either incompetent or surly if not dangerous for the health of others- AND health security in Cairo MUST be improved. Passsengers without a PCR test MUST NOT be allowed to board (because the Cairo staff know tests are free in France unlike in Egypt but people who can afford a plane ticket can afford an EGP200 test which is the maximum price for an Egyptian national).

‚ÄúYour health and well-being are at the heart of our concerns. 
That's why we have implemented strict health measures at every step of your journey.‚Äù

On 20 December 2020, for reasons of Covid19-safety, all restaurants and bars in Italy and France were closed by the respective governments.
On 04 January 2020 these bars and restaurants were still closed, for the same reasons.

However, on both our flights France vs Italy AF 1178 and back AF1179, both with all seats occupied, the company had thought well to distribute free meals and drinks (during a two-hours flight).

Let me assure you that it felt really very ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù to be seated, with my required face-mask, amidst a lot of neighbors with their masks down, eating slowly and talking with each other without any other precautions for at least twenty minutes.

"Awful from Paris, probably the worst flight ever!",Istanbul,Cancun,International,"Firstly, the flight leg from Istanbul to Paris was just fine, smooth and no issues! That's where the madness started. Upon arrival the airport seemed a desolate place, where it is mostly shutdown due to COVID-19, and so you cannot even get to eat except sandwiches at ridiculous prices. They take away any water to force you to buy Evian.
Now, contrary to the efforts above, the flight from Paris was MORE THAN FULL. How can it be? We had a group or mothers with yelling/screaming babies, each of them occupying just 1 seat. It mean that for many 3 people in a row we had actually 4 people!
Great way to deal with Covid situation, don't you think?
On top of that it got very very cold and the promised inflight Wi-Fi didnt exist. Now, the chorus of babies and little children yelled and screamed the entire 11.5 hours non-stop. Not even my Bose headphones with noise cancellation could handle it. Some asked the crew deal with them. Their response was ""What can we do?"". They just don't care. A young french woman next to me said it was the worst flight of her life too.
Dear AF, think about a limit of people onboard a Boeing 777, special distancing and comfort. I arroved completely exhausted and badly jetlagged. I will NOT choose AF again, willingly.

I had two issues at the airport, one of my baggage was delayed for 7 days and it is already under claim C-4114841.  I need proper full refund of my receipts for this claim.

The reported issue is under C-4114841. The checked in baggage was torn at the arrival and it is not fixable.  I was told in the email that Air France Bengluru team will call me and I was sincerely waiting for the response call from the customer care but so far I haven't received any call. When I tracked the status online today, it showed as CLOSED.

Chaotic flight,Paris,London,Europe,"We can accept that these are difficult times for airlines, Air France included, but this does not mean we have to be on the receiving hand of gross inconsistencies in policies related to social distancing, which this review is basically about. 
I could have taken this directly with the airline, but when receiving their customer feedback form, clicking on it only generated a message invoking a 'network error' (screen capture enclosed).
To cut a long story short, you receive detailed instructions before the flight about PPE and social distancing and these apply throughout the airport. You get to the Air France lounge and you have to keep your mask on every time you are not drinking or eating and when you are queuing for food you have floor marking clearly indicating social distancing and a one-way system to access the counter. 
Once you are on board, you end up crammed in a row of 3, unlike most of the previous flights during Covid-19. Even worse, they seem to have distributed a party of sportspersons (wearing matched T-shirts) across rows, instead of having them travelling together! 
In addition, you hear an announcement stating that ""the flight is full"" but you then see a good few rows with an empty middle seat (in economy I mean). This is where you think you could complain that having the highest status of FB, why are you one of the unlucky ones?

Air France is taking advantage of its clients,Toronto,Amsterdam,International,"Air France cancelled our air flights for three passenger and we were advised in July 13 2020 we would be full refunded within 3 business days.   After over 14 calls and being tied up in call centres for over 24 hours between  Expedia and Air France was advised they were delayed in processing refunds and needed to now do an investigation and they needed more time to process.   Keep in mind the air line cancelled the flights nothing to do with the passengers (as such no fault related to us).  On August 3rd 2020 we were advised our complaint was valid from both Expedia and Air France and we would be fully refunded for the three airline tickets, with a full refund!   This new process would take a staggering 90 days in addition to process, as such funds would be fully refunded by Nov 3rd.   Nov 9th 2020 no refunds received.   End of day Nov 9 received a form email advising no refunds would now follow  as we booked with Expedia, with no explanation.    They have had our funds for over half a year now on flights they cancelled.     We are now working with corporate office in expedia trying to ethically fix.    Air France is advising if we had booked with them directly we would have had our funds return when they cancelled our flights half a year ago.   Since we booked with Expedia they are telling us to go through Expedia.   When we work with Expedia we are being advised Expedia paid air France for the flights, which air France cancelled.

Air France - Boeing 777,Los Angeles,Paris,International,"I was coming back home after Covid-19 lockdown in USA with this airline.  Air France was one of the few airlines to fly to Europe again and with a normal ticket price.
Difficult time, difficult safety measures. 
Boarding was very well organized - by the seat number, starting from the end seats of the plain - no pushing or clutter, all boarding procedure took about 20-25 minutes. 
Of course - we all were wearing protective masks for about 12 hours of flight - it was not very comfortable, but tolerated. Cabin crew was friendly and attentive. Air plain was clean, pillows and blankets were clean and packed.  
Also we had evening meal and breakfast served - the only one difference from usual flight was not serving hot drinks (coffee or tee), because of coronavirus security measures.  Evening meal was normal, but breakfast was really poor - the absence of a warm drink doubled that feeling.

They don‚Äôt payback their fake vouchers and they left us on our own in the airport with no hotel room reservation.,Munich,Amman,International,"On Feb 10, 2020. There was a storm which is known to happen a week before. Almost all airlines have canceled their trips even the regional and local trains and buses were out of service. I called AF customer care many times and they confirmed that the flight is still on time and I must come to the airport. I had to take a taxi that costs 200‚Ç¨ to arrive Munich airport because the cost of rebooking costs more than that. I had to risk my self in the taxi for 1 hour to reach the airport and then AF cancelled the trip, and rebooked me an other trip on 11.of Feb. at 8 am. And promised to compensate my costs so they have given me a piece of paper that equals nothing, and told me that they will refund my costs but don‚Äôt exceed the written limits. Which was about 100 euro per night as a hotel reservation.  

Since there was a storm, and I didn‚Äôt have enough money to go back to my home and come back on the next day, started looking for hotel but in the price they provided all hotels were fully booked. And I had to spend the night sleepless. 

The next flight took off 30 minutes late so I lost the connection flight that goes to Jordan from Austria so I had to wait 2 more hours to have an alternative new reservation that flies from Austria to Germany to Jordan. 

36 hours of sleepless exhausting trip I arrived jordan totallY exhausted. And of course my bag didn‚Äôt arrive and I spent 3 days waiting for my clothes to come.  

So I decided to complain about the bad and irresponsible services especially that they didn‚Äôt provide us with vouchers and they didn‚Äôt reserve hotel rooms for their passengers like the other airlines resulting that all passengers were thrown on the floor and chairs for more than 18 hours. 

I have sent a list of food invoices and a taxi invoice and demanded a compensation in March 2020, the result was  they refused to compensate me and some one who is called Indrajeet Baruah, who is super ignorant wrote me twice only that he will not compensate me because there was a storm. Although the whole earth know that there was a storm and all other airlines cancelled their flights  and offered the passengers free of charge rebooking but this irresponsible airline (Airfrance) didn‚Äôt do any thing for this situation and was good to blame on the weather. 

After almost 3 moth of trying to contact this irresponsible customer care employee and getting no answer, I decided to complain on Facebook because they don‚Äôt provide any other platform to send a written compliment. And the result was: Dear Sir please contact our customer care department. 

However, I still didn‚Äôt get my payback ( invoice ) although I have sent this ignorant and irresponsible organization almost 300 emails of reminders. 

I never recommend to you to fly with airfrance at all. And never trust them if they tell you please pay first and we will pay back your bills.

As the virus is still ongoing and travelling restrictions are probably getting worse (maybe the whole trip will even be cancelled eventually) I decided to ask a full refund for my tickets.

I apply for a refund online through the air France form and after more than a month I finally receive an acknowledgment email saying that they received my request and they will come back to me as soon as possible. After some more weeks I received an email accepting to refund me with a voucher cause it has been my decision to cancel my trip and my flight is not cancelled, what is totally fine and I would agree with. I then call to air france as per the email from their customer service advise me to do. After speak with two different agents and be on the phone for more than 1 hour and 20 min mostly waiting for them to transfer me from one to another they have been completely unhelpful. Finally once they re direct me again to Delta who doesn't even have my booking in the system somehow. I told them that one of their colleges sent me an email saying that they could help me so it was really frustrating that they didn't even know what i was talking about or what was going on with my reservation or even that I requested a refund, they didn't know if i wanted a refund or a voucher...I asked to speak with the manager and they denied it to me so I asked to be transfer to another agent who would be more helpful because i couldn't even hear the advisor in the phone, she was apparently called Zia and she said she will transfer me but she just disconnected me completely what after they try to confuse you and play with a more than 300 GBP reservation is really upsetting. I called again and after another 49 min I spoke with someone called Ruby with suspiciously the same accent and voice than Zia and after try to play again with me and after a explosion where I told her I was writting this review and that myself work in customer service in the hospitality industry for many years and this was completly unacceptable and I know how this processes works and they are just wasting my time and energies She provided me with a phone number from delta and apparently a cancellation number to quote to them to sort out this. I am going to proceed once again to call to this number but all the gods help them if this doesn't help me because I will claim wherever I need and not only going to get that money back I will ensure that everyone knows the kind of terrible service they provide and the waste of money that it is this airline without any kind of proffesionality that only cares about to basically rob your money and make everything difficult so you give up so they can make money.

Complete failure to respect COVID-19 safety guidance,Paris,Bangui,International,"On 22 September 2020, I flew Air France from Paris to Bangui. While the seat in Business Class was comfortable and the cabin appeared clean, I was horrified by the utter lack of respect for regulations concerning social distancing in times of COVID-19.

During my flight, there were multiple passengers who stood up multiple times and congregated in groups of four or five in the aisle. Invariably, they took of their face masks (if they ever wore them) and spoke to each other at a very high volume. At one point, a maskless passenger was dancing through the aisles. When seated, many passengers had their masks off or covered only their mouths. There was one ineffective announcement that passengers should not move about the aisles unnecessarily - otherwise there was absolutely no effort on the part of the flight crew to enforce COVID safety regulations.

Upon arrival in Bangui, the baggage took very long to be delivered, leaving passengers crowded around the conveyor belt for over an hour. Again, many passengers were not wearing masks. While the delay was largely caused by ground staff and border officials working inefficiently, Air France could have ensured priority delivery of baggage to business class passengers. This probably would have led to faster delivery of all baggage, as a major problem was the baggage belt being occupied by bags from passengers still waiting in the queue for passport control while business class passengers were waiting for bags. But there was no more space for bags on the belt! If the bags had been prioritized, the business class passengers could have taken their bags and other bags would have replaced them. This would have been both more comfortable and more respectful of social distancing rules.

In other respects, the flight also was not acceptable. I looked at the menu and decided that it definitely was not worth staying awake, so I slept rather than eating. The in flight entertainment also was mediocre. And the flight was extremely expensive.

I visited the business lounge before the flight. The food was edible, but there was little variety. Cold beverages seemed to have spent very little time in the refrigerator. 

If I were to recommend this airline, it would be only due to the complete lack of competition that currently exists.",2020-09,2020-09-26,1.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0

However my post-payment bookings page doesn't list the extras. I thought it was just a technical glitch on the page. However... After emails and many FB messages back and forth, it is clear this is an intentional policy to make extra money off of people because they REFUSE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY, to fix the booking so that what I paid for is part of my booking, nor to refund me for the extras I paid in the booking process. All that they say is that I should consult my booking page and there is nothing they can do.

Lost baggage and horrible customer service,New York City,Paris,International,"In the least crowded time of traveling the airline lost my baggage or wasn't even placed on my flight. It has been 2 days now that I am in Paris and I have been given 3 different stories as to where my suitcase is; the first one said it arrived on at 9:42 AM just an hour after my flight arrived, another earlier today said it arrived 11AM. The last customer service person, said that my suitcase is it's on the way, then I asked to speak to a manager she said she doesn't have one and replied ""you're talking to me, sir"" before hanging up. Behold! This is how you are treated by this company, they loose your baggage and take no accountability and just outright lie to you without remorse. I will no longer be relying on Air France for any of my travels. There is no excuse for this horrible service as at this point the Covid pandemic is nothing new and the airline can't blame the loss of my baggage for having an elevated number of travelers/passengers flying. It is now Tuesday evening in Paris and I'm leaving back to NY on Monday. I wonder if I will even have my suitcase by then.

Average Business Class & degraded cabin service,New Delhi,Paris,International,"Flew Business Class from DEL to CDG on a Airbus A350-900. The seats were comfortable and spacious...and very worn out.  

The inflight entertainment screen was however new, big and fully touch screen. Content was OK but lacking Indian content.

No take pre-off drinks offered.  The first (light) meal was a cold sandwich in style with a budget airline meal.  The second (warm) meal was an omelette which tasted like it was cooked two days ago.

I had to keep asking for drinks refill as there were no cabin pour service apparently.

I appreciate some cabin cabin services may be have been adjusted due to COVID situation however, in that case, airlines should adjust the airfares accordingly a well, and not expect customer to pay full pre-COVID fares with degraded cabin service.

However, the super friendly cabin crew were exceptional!

Bad customer service,London,Pointe-a-Pitre,International,We are due to travel in December from London via Paris to Guadeloupe. We now need to change the London to Paris leg. No problem you would have thought as we had Flex tickets  where changes are free up until the day of departure.. We‚Äôve now spent days talking to the call centre and via messenger being told that we have to pay a ‚Äòpenalty‚Äô or a ‚Äòstop over‚Äô fee and various other reasons. Despite repeated requests for a breakdown of the legs costs they just ignore you. Even more annoying if we select the trip again as new passengers with the new timing we want it‚Äôs cheaper than the fare we paid. Basically Air France Flex tickets are useless as they just tell you the bit you need to change has gone up without any way of us checking. Seems like at best sharp practice and at worst a scam.

Terrible experience during the global pandemic,Mumbai,Atlanta,International,I've flown Air France before but will need to rethink this in the future. My elderly mother who suffers from travel sickness and anxiety related to that had to on top of that undergo even more duress due to Air France at the last minute sending a terse email that US green card holders cannot be boarded as they do not have permission to do so. This after my mom was already enroute from her city to Mumbai. Additionally we'd spent big bucks booking her on business class and I had spoken to AF agents multiple times between the booking and her travel date confirming required documentation etc and each time was reassured that all was in order. We were left scrambling and finding another airline and again spending money on a business class ticket and meanwhile AF is making us wait to refund the money we spent on them even though they messed up in not informing us upfront. Shame on you AF for showing very little compassion and care in handling this and only taking care of your bottom line of trying to make money off customers.,2020-08,2020-08-19,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

Worst airline company ever traveled with. DO NOT FLY WITH AIRFRANCE,Lyon,Dubai,International,"I am a frequent traveller and I have been Traveling  with Many airline companies over the past years, and I have never ever experienced such a bad treatment. 
First of all BEWARE of the fact that regardless the fact that you might pay ‚Ç¨ 1000 for a ticket from Dubai to Lyon, your ticket does not include ANY check in suitcase, which I find absolutely ridiculous. Every airline company which is not a low cost includes a check in baggage when spending such a high amount for a ticket. 
Moreover, it is not mentioned priorly therefore you might end up showing up at the airport and being charged 65‚Ç¨ for your extra baggage ! 

Fair enough, I found the staff absolutely unpleasant throughout the whole trip, the lady at the check in was honestly providing the worst customer service never had, she was aggressive and rude at the point that left me speachless. 

The crew on the plane was even worst, didn‚Äôt smile once for the whole 7 hours trip, provided cold and strict answers to any questions, they honestly looked like they deeply hate their job and couldn‚Äôt care less about the experience provided. 
Last but not least , I am vegetarian and I tried to request a specific meal on the website when checking in, but there was not option, for this reason I directly called Air France and requested to add this meal for me and my husband, which has been confirmed by phone . 
Once on the plane, the lady arrived with a standard meat based meal and I kindly asked for the vegetarian meal requested priorly. Beside the fact that she couldn‚Äôt speak a word of English, which I find hilarious for a cabin crew of an international company, but once she asked her colleague whatever was I asking for, she softly laughed and said they do not provide any vegetarian option but only the standard meal provided to everybody on the plan. 

Speachless 

Honestly amongst the hundreds flights experienced, with big and small companies , I have never went through such a terrible experience especially after paying a ticket of ‚Ç¨ 1000.

"My experience in Air France flight from Sao Paulo to Bangalore on August 1, 2020",Sao Paulo,Bengaluru,International,"My experience on travelling to India via Air France on Aug 1st 2020 via Paris with 3 hr layover. 
Many of us were including myself doesnt have any idea what to expect travelling during this COVID time apart from Vande bharath Misson.

From August 1st India has opened its international flights with few carriers and Air France was one of them. I had a very pleasant experience both inside the flight as well as in Bangalore airport.
I never expected the orderly and perfect arrangements in Bangalore Airport. Its was properly choreographed. 
I would suggest people to wait for one more week(till 8th Aug) so that they can avoid hotel quarantine.
Here it goes...

1. Flight was from GRU. 
2. MUST TAKE PCR test. 
3. Whatever airfrance asks for documents have it ready printed and filled. The hard copy is very helpful in Paris airport. Once your flight confirms they send you all the required documents. DO NOT SKIP ANY.
4. As of 1 st Aug..  we reached airport 5 hrs before expecting long queues for checks in GRU but there were none and surprisingly the airline counters were open too.
5. All were straight forward. Keep your sanitizers in spray form. It makes life easier. 
6. Using Gloves also a good idea. Get disposable gloves.. 
7. Flight was clean,  food was good.  Served hot. So no need pack food and water. Basic dinner lunch and breakfast is served. My flight was at 15:00 so after we took off, dinner was served and then before we land Breakfast was served. Enough water is provided. Same in Paris to Bangalore lap, 2 meals were served. The food was not elaborate they used to be but enough. 
There was very few people inside the flight, most of us were able to stretch out in other seats :D 
8. Without PCR test result REPORT as negative, you wont be able to allow after 2nd lap. In Paris before on boarding to Bangalore,  they need to see test result. (Printed test paper makes it easier) 
There were people who came without PCR results from USA and they werent allowed to board the flight. They were asking many excuses but denied their entry.
After you enter, they give you couple of documents to fill.. Fill all of them and keep it ready before landing in Bangalore. You need to give them immediately after you land in the airport.
9. Once in Bangalore airport.. every thing is properly organized,  1st your temp is checked,  2nd oximeter check,  3rd PCR test results verified.
10. Hardly in 30 min according to the rush, (i finished in 30 min).. 
head to immigration,  
collected bag,  (Only our flight has arrived at that time and baggage was already in the carousel) 
Clear customs(i wasn't checked for any).
11. Once u exit, u will be given hotel option.. one 5 star and one 3 star. 
12. I took 5 star.. 4100  per day With all 3 meals, and enough drinking water,  clean sanitized room and very polite and cordial people.
13. The hotel guys arrange a local bus to take u to hotel, get settled for 7 DAY MUST QUARANTINE. 
14. All comes to ur room. Food was hot and tasty. Simple veg meals. If u need more u could order. 
All were arranged properly. As I landed in bangalore at mid night I was worried about ferrying taxi..but that was also taken care by the hotel guys.
Another tip is have some Indian cash in hand. You need to pay for the bus(300/-) but if there is no hotel quarantine then its not necessary. You have an ATM before you exit if you need cash.

I really appreciate both the Airlines and also Bangalore Airport arrangements.",2020-08,2020-08-05,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

"Much Better than BA, by miles",Birmingham,Munich,Europe,"Just returned from Munich. Flew with Air France.  Had to Change in Paris on the outward and inward journeys.  Small place with very comfortable seats.  Free coffee.  The flights were smooth and barely a jolt on landing.  Staff very friendly too.  We took hand luggage so had no problems with this.  Staff insisted on customers wearing surgical face masks but for those people who didn't have them staff supplied them free of charge.  Easy to get on board and bus waiting to take us to the terminal once we arrived.  No inflight entertainment available on board but each flight was only an hour or so long, so this was not required.

AirFrance withholding my money 4+ months after they cancelled my flight,Paris,Lisbon,Europe,I have been unsuccessful in obtaining my money back from Air France after they cancelled my flight due to COVID.

SCAM AIRLINE - No reimbursement yet for a cancelled flight in April!,Paris,Palma de Mallorca,Europe,"Air France has really the worst customer service of all airlines. They lost all respect for their customers and suddenly became a SCAM AIRLINE. How is it possible that no one has the decency of picking up the phone at their customer service numbers? All you hear is a recording, same with emails. Our flights Paris - Palma de Mallorca were cancelled in April and I had no reply to my claim since then. We paid 350 EUR in February for these flights and it is now almost August. I feel scammed by Air France. I wonder how this airline can be France's national airline? It's truly an embarrassment.   Up until today, no refund, no information, no reimbursement even though we are theoretically protected by European consumer laws - they clearly do not care about these laws.

Excellent Service,Johannesburg,Glasgow,International,"I booked my mother on a repatriation fight from Johannesburg to Glasgow on 11th July and as an 81 year old with knee and hip problems I booked her wheel chair assistance. I do not think it would have been possible for any Air Line to treat her any better or look after her as well as Air France did.

From the minute she arrived at the assembly point in Sandton, South Africa they had a wheel chair waiting for her and someone to help with her luggage and onto the bus. When arriving at the airport the had a wheel chair waiting and once again someone to help with her luggage. They assisted her the whole way (checkin, weighing luggage, taking luggage to collection point, through customs, departure lounge and the up to the door of the aircraft and to her seat).

The service on the trip from Johannesburg to Pairs was outstanding. On arrival in Paris she was helped off the plane to the waiting wheelchair at the door of the plane and taken straight to the business class lounge (without her even having to ask) as she had a 4 hour layover. The constantly checked up on her to make sure she was alright and to reassure her that they had not forgotten her. Once again took her to the plane when it was time to leave.

This was notbthe case with KLM as the gelp was so bad she even had to ask othe passengers to help with her carry on luggage.

HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE !!!!!,Paris,Athens,Europe,"Well I traveled to Paris from Athens for 2 days well all good through security check and then we boarded we had the middle sit empty all good ..  and there we go the bad experience starts ... some people weren't wearing their masks properly with their nose out and some weren't wearing it at all .. and the aircraft was doing absolutely nothing about it they didnt care about our safety at all.

And then my return yesterday 15/07/2010 from paris to athens arrival time 6:50pm flight number AF1332

And again inside plane safety was the same people with no masks and flight attendants was doing nothing about it ... 
And anyway 
We arrive at the airport and the police is there waiting for the arrivals and they start asking if we have the QR codes and we had no clue what they talking about they put us on a corner and then explained that there's a new greek law that says u have to fill a form before u enter the country otherwise u get a fine of 500‚Ç¨

They kept us at the airport till 10pm and the police was saying the airline representatives have to come it's their responsibility for what happened cause they didnt let you all know that u had to fill that form ... and at the beginning they were saying the airline has to take us back to paris and then they started saying we'll pay the fine of 500‚Ç¨ .. and after hours of waiting they decided to let us go and get tested and not pay anything this time.

We all were ready to sue the company if we had to pay for something we didnt know

Refused to refund when air France cancelled my reservation,Minneapolis,Rabat,International,"I booked 5 airline reservations with Farboom on 09/19/2019 to fly Air France on June 28th 2020. The airline cancelled our reservation and changed it to July 1st. Then they cancelled again and scheduled it for July 12th. I finally had enough of them deciding for me when to travel. The country that I was going to would not open the air traffic until July 14th. In addition, the country would not allow any airline to land in it's airports except the domestic airline. The airline I was traveling with, would not be able to fly us there. I contacted Fairboom many times to refund me the money, they want to charge me $75 for every passanger. I refuse to loose $375 for a cancellation that I didn't initiate. The airline is the one that cancelled my original tickets, not me. They didn't honor their commitment to fly us on the date that we chose. I know that I am entitled to a full refund without any question!
I am going to give them one more chance for them to make right and refund me the money. I used Fairboom for many years. I travel with my family every two years and bring my mother once a year. In addition to anyone coming to visit me, I purchase their tickets with Fairboom. I am also a board member of a large community which I always recommend Fairboom for all member's travel needs.

I literally started to cry trying to find a garbage can to throw away my stuff when a very kind LAX employee brought me a carbon box. ( all the stores were closed due to Covid so no place to buy a suitcase). Then on the aircraft my chair was broken. The nightmare continued.

VERY BAD SERVICE,Kyiv,Nantes,Europe,"PROBLEM
My flight was partially cancelled by the airline company. 
No option to get cashback for the whole flight.
No alternative proposed by the airline company.

CONTEXT
Back and forth flight for 2 persons from KBP to NTE for 27/07/2020.
Reservation was done directly through the site airfrance.fr.
Flight is served by Air France and KLM.

SOLUTION (not solved)
Search in Internet and on Air France site for solution: no solution.
Search in Internet and on Air France site for e-mail or other digital communication service: no solution.
Call Air France FRENCH support - after 40 minutes I got a person answered in ENGLISH, which redirected me on other phone line.
After 40 minutes on the other hone line the call is ended with no answer.
Next day after 1 hour I got an answer that I should contact KLM service support for my problem (which I find not logic because I did my reservation through Air France).
After 1 hour on phone I finally got in contact with KLM. They told that I should call another country KLM customer support. (my current mobile phone plan will cost me around 3 EUR/min for this country => 180 EUR/h)
As alternative, I contacted all other communication services of KLM (WhatsApp, Messenger, Twitter) with explanation of my problem.
Yet, not solution‚Ä¶

CONCLUSION
In total I spent around 6 hours on this issue, while, probably, I would still need to spend hours more to solve the issue. In addition, call cost to another country.
These all are beyond the price of ticket I got.

Who will pay back the hours I spent with useless customer support to solve THEIR problem?
I would suggest the least they could propose in such a case ‚Äì to give higher class of flight, or free of charge service or at least something‚Ä¶",2020-06,2020-06-16,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Victimized During Flight,Montreal,Cairo,International,Arrived in Montreal 3 hours before take off to be told that our seats had been sold and we would have to go standby.  Seats became available and our party of 5 including me and my wife were scattered in the plane.  A very sick 14 year old told the airline that I had performed a sexual act on myself mid flight.  I was subsequently arrested and spent 30 hours in jail in Paris where I was treated horribly and it was filthy.  Over a year later and psychotherapy I am still suffering from this victimization. I was finally realized because there was no evidence.  There was no evidence because I was innocent. -- This took place in March 2019.

Air France are awful when things go wrong,Manchester,Cancun,International,"I booked a package holiday via Expedia and chose Air France for flights. Expedia has refunded my monies due to collapse of Flybe, but Air France have avoided doing so, it‚Äôs now 12 weeks since the request for refund was submitted. Other airlines such as Jet2 were proactive and contacted me - with Air France, you have to instigate proceedings - they just keep your money otherwise, it‚Äôs shocking. After weeks of waiting and many communications, Air France offered a voucher and I had immediately refused the voucher requested my money back. They have now said they‚Äôve paid the refund, but they have not as my bank or card has not received any monies from them at all. Air France were also very quick to ‚Äúhide behind‚Äù Expedia and will direct you back via them (which then adds further delays) even though the credit card transaction is directly with Air France.

I had flown Air France regularly as a businessman for many years and was very impressed by their service. It‚Äôs one of the major reasons we specifically chose them over other airlines.

The way they have treated me during this time and with this case has shattered all the good I thought about them as a company. I will never, ever use Air France again.

After asking him that me bringing him two empty ones would most likely mean I would also like two new ones his attitude and huffing and puffing did certianly not indicate the great pleasure and enjoyment of his job. He scrambled for two bottles somewhere in the back - as the result i got two non refrigerated bottles of water - he didnt even attempt to ask whether id like cold or room temperature. By all due respect - this is buisness class and even I as a non proffesional flight attendant can think as far as asking a passenger whether he would like cold or room temperature!

I myself have to deal with the current health circumstances around the world and the required changes we all face in this industry yet can this simply not be used as an ongoing excuse not to deliver outstanding service and quality. 

Dinner served was for sure closer to a business class standard one would expect, breakfast however left me with the feeling of being seated on Ryan air! Shocking!  
I feel that this feedback needs to be made public and will post such on social media and other media platforms as AF has truly got to wake up - especially in the current wake of vast decreasing air travel - not giving AF the ‚Äúwhite card‚Äù to retain pricing but deliver worse service and quality.

Bathrooms werent even supplied with decent accessories.

Over and above, business class was pretty full - so much to keeping spaces for COVID 19 health risks!

In short, of any possible do not fly AF and certianly do not fly business class.",2020-04,2020-05-05,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0

Poor Customer Service,Miami,Paris,International,"In October of 2019 I booked flights for my husband and myself to Paris and then in November I added by  teen daughter.  We booked through a third party but our flights were on Air France and scheduled for the second week of April. Due to covid Air France was forced to cancel flights which we understood. We even understood that perhaps we would only get a voucher for a year.  To date we have not heard back on our flights with the exception of my daughters flight which was vouchered until November of 2020, not even a year from the flight date. Thus we lose our money since we are not comfortable making flight plans this year for a country that, like ours, is suffering from covid realities and complexities.  This is very bad service in my opinion and it basically forces travelers to simply throw away the money for the trip.  I think this is terrible customer service. I hate to say it but had I booked though American Airlines this would not have happened.

Perfect handling of COVID-19 cancellation,Melbourne,Tel Aviv,International,"This review is not for a flight, but for the handling of Air France of our booking and refund during the COVID-19 crisis.

My partner and I had flights booked via Air France, including a number of carriers, to travel from Melbourne to Tel Aviv and back for a family event in May. Obviously, as restrictions started to kick in due to the COVID-19 crisis, we needed to cancel our trip.

I always make sure to buy my airline tickets directly from the airline (if it's a large/ established airline), in case things go sour, this means i can deal with the airline directly, rather than through some faceless 3rd party website or an agent. And this was the case here.

We called the Australian office, explained the situation, and we were relieved to hear that we can receive a full refund (rather than voucher), without any penalties etc. The agent explained that it may take several weeks, which I understood given airlines are in cashflow crisis at the moment. It was very easy to talk to the agent and I was happy to wait.

I was delighted then to find, a few days later, that the refund was processed in full already - in fact, the refund was dated 1 day BEFORE I called their customer service - they must have processed it immediately and it was still the day before in France local time.

I really couldn't have asked for an easier interaction, especially during this time of uncertainty. I can't wait to fly again, and will make sure to give Air France more of my business in the future based on this positive experience. Well done Air France!",2020-04,2020-04-16,5.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

Superlative,Paris,Osaka,International,"My wife surprised with an upgrade. We were on our way back from UK to Japan. She couldn&t get me upgraded on the first leg, but we did Paris to Osaka in first class. What a revelation. We really didn't want to blink, let alone sleep, in case we missed something.

The experience began the moment we stepped into the First Class lounge at CDG. Big , comfortable room, not too many people. Food, real food, real good food. After a ""breakfast"" in Economy class on a short-hop flight, it was simply wonderful. Drink, too. If you are going to have wine with breakfast, it might as well be a good wine, right?

Priority boarding, of course. We couldn't believe our seats They reclined in 16 different ways, They were at an angle so we didn't feel like cattle. We spent the hour or so just pushing buttons to see what happened. Big TV. Noise-cancelling headphones. Not sure we could ever go back to Economy.

There‚Äôs a reason the flights are so cheap....,Tokyo,Aberdeen,International,"Three days before I was due to fly back from Tokyo, Air France emailed me to say my connecting flight was cancelled.

Well they hadn‚Äôt even mentioned the reason the flight had been cancelled before this, seemed a little too convenient to me (I flew on 11th March, before all the coronavirus really got going).  Ok, so no compensation but you can apply for a refund of expenses occurred as a result of the cancellation. I duly sent off copies of receipts and information requested.

They clearly have received it but are saying they haven‚Äôt to worm their way out of paying It, it seems to me. They have now said they haven‚Äôt heard from me (they have!) and so they‚Äôve closed the case. They are also not contactable by phone at the moment.

After the massage, I went back to the First Lounge to enjoy a steak dinner followed by a sample of three Rozelieures Single Malts.

I was escorted to my seat on the plane.  If I recall, they could not serve champagne/alcohol  due to a licensing issue, until we took off.  The comfort of the seat, amenity kit, entertainment, and eventually the food and beverage were all top notch.

I landed at CDG for a layover and was escorted to the La Premiere Lounge.  This place is nice.  I took a nap and got a massage.  Then I took a walk around the airport before returning to the lounge.  I ordered a steak meal which was delicious with great service.  I relaxed a bit longer before heading to my flight to Dubai.  There was no escort to the flight.

Glad to be home,Paris,Atlanta,International,"I will spare the gentle reader the ordeal trying to rebook my round trip tickets on Delta airlines! Originally booked to fly back to the States via Roissy CDG (Paris) I was booked, cancelled, rebooked repeatedly until eventually I was even given a flight out of Schipol for a week later than the original flight..,
After booking train tickets (with great difficulty as all trains OUT of Paris were full) and booking three hotel days at Schipol Best Western, I decided to take matters into my own hands and arranged a flight on Air France from CDG to Atlanta Hartsfield. Turned out to be the SAME FLIGHT that Delta told me was cancelled, only on their SkyMiles partner. 
The airport was nearly empty. The flight a bit delayed (awaiting crew) but that is understandable under the extreme circumstances with Paris on lockdown and flights cancelled left and right. 
The flight was nine rather than six or seven hours because of USA air space restrictions. Nine lovely, pampered, hours. 
Started with champagne as a preflight drink, delicious ‚Äúd√©jeuner‚Äù attentive service and drinks throughout as well as a nice late snack a half hour before landing. 
The attendants all had to wear mask and gloves but I understand their anxiety, even though those measures are of little real value. 
We underwent a CDC temperature and health screening prior to deplaning with orders to quarantine for 14 days at home. (Have since been contacted by Md Dept of Health to follow up and enforce the CDC orders). 
Our (again Delta) flight from ATL to BWI was cancelled, but that‚Äôs another story. 
Moral; don‚Äôt count on your carrier to rebook you in times of crisis or emergency. Just grab your wallet and book on the country‚Äôs national carrier ( great if it‚Äôs an Alliance or Team member of your carrier but not critical). 
Then immediately contact YOUR CARRIER to arrange a FULL REFUND BASED ON THEIR CANCELLATION OF YOUR FLIGHTS. You have to stand your ground. Delta was good on this point as their own computer had documented the multiple bookings an cancellations and rebookings and even airport departure city changes. 
Finally I was able to get nearly full refund on our train (Thalys) tickets purchased through Trainline, and two of the three nights from Best Western but only after calling the hotel directly.

Evacuating from Corona Virus,Paris,New York City,International,"I flew home unexpectedly on March 15.  It was at the point where the Coronavirus had gotten to a critical stage of development in France.  The morning of my flight every non essential service or store in France was closed indefinitely.  So, all of the shops -except a snack shop and a newsstand were closed.  The terminal, 2E was remarkably quiet.  I checked in on line but without a printer, I had to go through luggage tag printing and luggage drop off.  AF has gone to a drop your luggage yourself system which, at least for the first time, was a bit challenging.  
On board, our flight had down sized the equipment from a  Airbus 380 to a Boing 777.   The flight was only half full.  With that, service on the aircraft was excellent.  The food was adequate and drinks were generous.  WE has good onboard entertainment including wifi (free if you just want to check and send e-mail).
Arriving at JFK we were instructed to remain in our seats - even when the familiar ding comes from the flight deck.  We sat for about 10 minutes when we heard a voice on the PA identifying himself as a CDC employee telling us that we would receive a health questionnaire that we must fill out before deplaning.  We did and upon deplaning we had our questionnaire read and our temperature taken.  From there it was on to immigration, then baggage inspection.  Immigration was empty, and with the 20 minute delay in deplaning, our luggage was waiting for us and we just walked through customs rolling our bags.  From the door of the aircraft to the exit door of the terminal, it took no more than 10 minutes. It was really an amazing and good experience - considering this was only day 2 of health checks for people coming in from overseas.  On the down side, of course this was evidence that the US travel market was shutting down, and that was sad though I knew was needed.",2020-03,2020-03-23,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0
Nice voyage to Quito,Paris,Quito,International,"2 legs, one short from Prague to CDG and then long haul flight to Quito on Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner. The day before my departure I got SMS and mail informing me that the flight from CDG is postpone by 2,5 hours from CDG also with info about meal voucher. Transfer at CDG quick. Seated by the window in exit seat row gave me enough legroom but seat too narrow, not really comfortable for 11 hours in the air. We just arrived 50 minutes late behind the original schedule. Cabin crew cordial and helpful. They regularly passed with water and make disinfection of toilets to prevent Corona virus. The lunch tasty with champagne as aperitif with non and alcoholic drinks, coffee/tea and digestive. During the flight snacks and drinks  in the gallery.

Bad check in experience,Paris,Beirut,International,"The welcoming staff at the airport didn't treat me well. After I did send my luggage and moved, they stopped me for my hand luggage which was 1.5KG overweight. Bad treatment and communication. Not flexible at all, not logic and they refused to allow me to pay extras for the weight, they said i should throw them away or ship my hand luggage which i had medicine inside it and i couldn't ship it, and since no time to go back to the counter which was far, so would miss my flight.
I almost missed my flight!! It made me very uncomfortable the entire day due to this incident. What a bad reputation!!!  I will not take Air France again.

What an abortion of an airline -AVOID,Cancun,London,International,"We flew back from Cancun with Air France and connected in Paris for London.
The seats are the most uncomfortable I have ever experienced, the service was a disgrace and they seem to be the most disorganised bunch of fools I have ever encountered.
The food was inedible, they even gave my wife a normal meal even though a gluten free had been ordered, luckily one of the members of staff noticed and rectified quickly. After the meal we did not see the staff again until just before landing, coffee cups not collected and no further offer of any refreshments whatsoever throughout the flight.

Paris airport is at best a complete clusterf**k with no one actually knowing what to do. We travelled amid the COVID19 outbreak and the airport was almost empty. Nonetheless it still took 3 attempts and over 2 hours to get us checked in for our transfer.

I will never fly Air France again, and I would certainly advise anyone against using them. We can only hope that in a time of financial crisis when airlines are suggesting they may go bankrupt, Air France do not survive, it will be to the benefit of the industry if they went under.

"Great flight, accommodating staff!",Tokyo,Paris,International,"My partner & I flew the 10am long haul from NRT - CDG (going onto London). 
There was some confusion on the online booking system that you either pay or don't get seats together (as I had heard from friends who had taken the same route). On the outbound journey I paid to make sure we were together. On the return we chanced it, however at check-in I let them know that as I was pregnant a window seat that I was assigned was not the best option for me. The first lady said she couldn't change us without payment, however to ask the lady at the gate. We did so, and once everybody was checked in, she moved our seats to extra legroom for free. 

This really made our journey better and more comfortable for a 13 hr flight. There was also a spare seat next to us which was a bonus - thank you Air France for accommodating pregnant passengers :) the food was alright but nothing to write home about. They had some small snacks for inbetween meals - next time I would bring my own healthier versions.

Cancelled my confirmed bookings twice without warning,Cairo,Oslo,International,"First of all: I never got to actually travel with them, because of the airliners complete lack of customer service and willingness to assist their customers. Here is the story:

Because of the Korona situation I had to return to my home country swiftly. I booked a flight with AirFrance online and received an e-mail with confirmation. The e-mail was weirdly scarce, but included a link to their internet site where I could see that everything was in order. Also, I could see that the correct amount had been reserved on my MasterCard.

The next day, when my flight was leaving, I happened to check the link in the e-mail again, but now my booking was gone. I was only forwarded to a blank internet site. By calling AirFrance, they told me my booking had been cancelled. Now, mind you, this happened with absolutely no warning or information from the airliner. The customer service agent explained that it was not possible to book tickets online with AirFrance from Egypt within 72 hours of departure. The website had said nothing about this, the order had gone through and I had received a confirmation. The agent could do nothing and told me I had to go to the airport to buy a ticket cash (!). I told him I had to know for sure that I would get a seat on the plane, because of the situation, and told him to arrange a booking until I could pay the ticket. He arranged this for me and told me I had to pay the ticket cash at the airport before 22:00 p.m. I received an e-mail with a new confirmation. 

In order to make sure I would actually get a ticket, I went to the airport early that evening. Well, lo and behold, there were absolutely no AirFrance staff at the whole airport. I called them and they told me that my second booking had also been cancelled, again completely without any heads-up or warning. He also told me that there would be no AirFrance personell at the airport until 22:50 p.m. that night...

The agent could not guarantee availability and could not make another booking that would guarantee a seat on the plane. He could not do this since it was not ""their policy"". I asked him if their policy was to accept bookings from customers, confirm the bookings on e-mail, reserve money on their credit card and then cancel the bookings without giving the customer any information or warning. A question for which the agent had no answer. He could do...nothing... Now, I could not take the chances of any further delay, so instead my fianc√©e found an available flight the very same night with Emirates. She booked online for me, a booking which was paid and made without any problems or delay. For half the price that AirFrance wanted.
 
And now, to the real gems in this story: I had three friends who took the same AirFrance-flight that night. They had all booked their flights well within 72 hours of departure. Finally: On the phone with AirFrance, they recommended that I complained to them online. When I try to do exactly that, all their available options demand that I have a confirmed booking number. Which I of course do not have, since they have cancelled them all. 

Oh, by the way: Four days after my first booking, the amount is still reserved on my MasterCard.",2020-03,2020-03-17,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,1.0,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,1.0,3.0819906910132473
Double-charged for luggage and rude service at CDG,Paris,Chicago,International,"Flying to ORD right now, unfortunately on Air France since Delta cancelled most of their flights out of Paris and got me stuck with Air France. 

To begin with, since weren't going smoothly. Air France web site was malfunctioning and kept kicking me back to the first page as was trying to check-in without giving me any errors. Just wouldn't proceed. Tried checking in via their app, that went better. Got checked in and seats assigned via an app. Tried to choose two seats together by a window in the same class of service (economy), but they charge 35 euro per seat extra for that! They are the same seats, just two together instead of the middle row of four. I haven't seen any other airline charge for that. Oh well.

Since AF has ridiculous carry-on policy (both bags have to be under 26lbs, your carry-on and personal items). Paid 85 Euro for one extra it via their app. Took a screenshot of it. A bit crazy price gouging, but I guess that's how they roll. Limit carry-on to nothing (my empty carry-on and backpack weighed 14lbs out of 26lbs allowance). The app said I was going to get a receipt in the email, but it never came. Got a confirmation from my credit card that the charge went through.

Tried getting wheelchair assistance booked for my wife via Air France web site. It made no sense. Tried calling and emailing their Saphir service, but couldn't get through on the phone and nobody ever replied to my email. 

Fortunately was able to find Saphir at the airport to request a wheelchair for my wife and drop off our bag. Here came a surprise. They didn't have our 85 euro payment in the system. They needed receipt from my email. I never got the email. I showed them the screenshot of the app that we paid, and receipt from our credit card, but they said we had to pay again. I got tired of arguing with them, so we just paid again using another credit card. Asked the man and the woman that were handling the baggage at the Saphir (the ones that made me pay twice) what their names were for my records. The man got really rude and started screaming at me ""this is not America, this is Air France, we don't give out  names here. You don't like it, it's too bad, don't fly our airline"" Kept going on and on. My wife asked me not to press the matter, so we let it go for now. We will just deal with double charges from our credit card when we get home.

Overall, pretty disgusting experience with this airline so far. The website that doesn't work. The app that doesn't work. The rude employees. I wish a had a difference choice of who to fly with, but at the moment we are stuck with Air France because it's the only flight available out of the country due to COVID-19. In the future, I'll make sure not to ever travel on Air France.",2020-03,2020-03-17,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

We got to the airport at around 4:30AM thinking at that time the airport should be empty and 2 hours before our plane should be plenty of time. I was wrong. As you enter T2, there was a huge line to check-in your luggage. There are specific counters for each flight and also counters for priority. The priority line was not well marked. We thought that we would miss our flight due to the line, but they finally opened up the other lines to the Paris line, and then it moved quickly. We got to the plane as it was boarding. Even if you do mobile boarding, you still need help at the counter to check-in your luggage. There are kiosks for printing out your boarding passes. The flight was almost full.

A380 is a Wonderful Airplane,Los Angeles,Paris,International,"At least Air France gives you a few inches of knee room in economy. But it disappears if the person in front of you reclines. You do not get an amenity kit. You get a pillow and blanket, and a headset. The headset is dual prong. If you use your own headphones or earbuds, you don't need a dual prong adapter, using only one plug works. The is a wide selection of entertainment. But the system is slow to respond, using the remote keypad is easier to use vs the touch interface. The food was OK, and they have snacks and drinks in the galley throughout the flight. The service was good, but not as good as Asian carriers, but better than American carriers. We were in an A380 which gives you more room to walk around. I recommend getting a set in the last 7 or so rows on the main deck. It is like a mini cabin separated by curtains. There is no galley in this section, so it is not crowded. There are 2 bathrooms in the very rear. In the rear is a staircase to the upper deck you can use to exercise. The bathroom area has room to stretch.

- We had a specific question about customer communication and time tables, which would  have deserved little less than a casual and quick response; a hostess took the story seriously and explained the technicalities, then the chief cabin attendent came up with more information, and after landing the pilotess (or the pilot who happened to be a female) completed the whole action, so that the curious customer was fully informed about the flight plan and management of potential delays; the customer is now rightfully deterred to say anything wrong about the airline
- a door of the plane was damaged during loading of the luggage, forcing the company to find another plane, resulting in a change of plane and a delay: whilst we do not think that the luggage handlers were excessively delicate in their work, we were impressed by the efficiency in which the damage limitation was carried on: timely communication, quick finding of a new plane, etc.; it is in the non-routine that we can tell good airlines from the other ones",2020-03,2020-03-13,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

The other issue was lavatory facilities- it was easier to access on Delta than on Air France(with many cabins including premium and economy having to share the few in the main cabin). British Airways is even better with an exclusive lavatory for the Premium Economy cabin.

The woman was mad and she was shouting that Air France favorize France passengers and that it is discrimination and that she had experienced that before with this company.

Where Has All the Service Gone,Houston,Rome,International,"I am a 69 year old female that uses a cane to walk. I received excellent service with assistance while in the airport terminals themselves.

Not one stewardess or Captain standing there offered me any assistance whatsoever. They  then took my cane before takeoff and said they needed to secure it in the upper bins but would give it back to me after takeoff. Not one came back and retrieved my cane for me. I had to ask other passengers for assistance. I, as well as those sitting next to me were never offered any wine to drink although it is included in premium economy. I was always offered soda, water, juice. On my return trip home there was a French couple who was sitting in the row across who was given numerous glasses of wine or aperitifs as well as extra food. They were obviously being given preferential service which did not go unnoticed by the passenger sitting next to me either. When I requested a cup of coffee I was told I had to wait till after they served everyone water before I could get one. By the time they brought it to me I was finally sleeping but they woke me up to give it to me.

"A decent service, a great fare",Manchester,Bangkok,International,"Flew MAN-CDG-BKK SIN-CDG-MAN in late January early February. 
Firstly the price of the ticket was great coming in some ¬£600 less than the Middle Eastern carriers and also BA so as pure value for money I couldn‚Äôt fault it. 
All of the flights ran on time which is another major plus. 
Short haul flights were efficient with economy seats with the middle seat kept free and ample (albeit not to my taste) cold breakfast was served despite a very short flight time. 
The Air France lounge in CDG was large spacious and well stocked which is a lot more than can be said for the Third Party lounge in SIN which was pretty dire. 
CDG-BKK was on an old configuration plane, which is not uncommon for European airlines who tend to fly it as a tourist route. Seats were not lie flat so whilst comfortable when awake it was difficult to sleep. 
SIN-CDG was in the new cabin with lie flat seats which were far more comfortable and as it was a night flight we both managed 5-6 hours sleep.
Service on all legs was very professional and well French really! Food was served, drinks were offered to correspond but it just didn‚Äôt feel like a business class service.
My only real disappointment was the food, The chef designed dishes on both long haul flights just didn‚Äôt work and the rest of the menu was just a bit meh!! I was expecting more, but maybe I‚Äôve just been spoilt as I‚Äôve had the pleasure of flying business and first on Emirates.

Chaos at CDG,London,Bogota,International,"I don't know if it's fair to blame Air France for security problems at CDG but it was necessary to change planes here.

We came into and left from the same terminal and same hall but the queues for security checks took well over two hours. We had to keep checking that we really did have to be at the end of the massively long queue. As for the flight from Paris to Bogota itself it seemed cramped and was OK at best. 
We came back Premium Economy and, as to be expected, it was much more comfortable but still no drinks before the meal for example. I'd had two gin and tonics by that time on Cathay Pacific and that was in Economy.

Christmas travel,Miami,Paris,International,"I booked Delta Airlines from MIA to CDG. I discovered it was actually an Air France flight. The flight there was great. Plenty of room, food was better then expected, and free drinks (alcohol) included. Also included 1 bag under the plane. 

The return trip was not as smooth. We were in the last boarding group, and my son was singled out at the Air France gate for extra screening (as my wife and daughter freaked out because we were already the last family in the plane). I don‚Äôt mind the extra screening, but, we ended up being the last 2 on the plane, and they were anxious to close the airplane doors behind us. I wish they had done it earlier, as we were at the gate over an hour prior to boarding. My son didn‚Äôt even have enough time to put his shoes back on. 

Only complaint about booking is that if you book via Delta, and are in an Air France flight, there is no way to upgrade or reserve your meals. I called both companies.

Another Flight with Air France,Atlanta,Paris,International,"I have flown Air France about half a dozen times; maybe more.

No words for it,Paris,Cape Town Central,International,"Sorry to conclude that our flight back home (CPT- CDG) was the same shame, and not meeting our expectations at all ! 
We believe Air France needs to re-consider their level of services, really. Service of staff, food quality and drinks quantity offered in Premium Class is below acceptable, especially the 'Kosher' meal. Half the portion of the regular meals, and no taste. Sorry, have to say that. No snacks and/or drinks were offered in the meantime during the 11 hour flight. If you want to have a drink or snack between the two meals during this flight of 11 hours (should therefore be 3 meals instead of 2, as they show on their website when the flight is longer than 10,5h !!), you can walk all the way to the back of the airplane, where it is FULL of customers having drinks like they are visiting a pub, and chatting staff in the 'kitchen' doing nothing and actually do not want to help you at all. Friendliness is not their core business it seems. Strike, that is all they really like to do.

I called back, waited another 20 minutes, and was then transferred to a department  who could not help me and told me to call back. I called the next morning, and they refused to reinstate our tickets because they said that the partial refund had already been processed. However, I would not actually receive the partial refund for 4-6 weeks. So, now we have no tickets and Air France has stolen $3000 of our money ($6000 business class tickets.)

I flew Air France flight 65 Lax to Paris Exit row seats 90F & 90E..(one more but can‚Äôt remember #) well 3 of us took up the whole row of four seats (since one seat was empty) and paid extra $80 each seat for the horrible experience.  First it was a row isle seats meaning people kept crossing over to the other side of plane  using that isle we were on. We had people stepping on our feet several times ! Not only that one of the monitors did not work so inflight entertainment could not be viewed on an 11 hr flight ! We were served 1 meal and a small snack as the flight arrived in Paris.  Attendants were friendly but not overly helpful.  The plane looked old.

Horrible treatment at the airport,Paris,San Francisco,International,"Flight AF 084 Paris San Francisco, 7th of February. 

I am a gold member with Sky Team for the last 3 years, and I have always always taken the Sky Priority queue. I am standing in the queue at CDG, Gate 44, 9:45am boarding the plane, minding my own business until the AF staff controlling the passports comes and, after seeing my passport, in a rather rude manner, asks me to go in the general boarding queue. I try to explain to her that I am a flying blue gold member. She refuses to listen, starts yelling and insists I leave and turns her back. I ask my neighbor if I missed something, I check the sign which clearly says ‚ÄúFlying Blue Gold‚Äù. He confirms he is also a gold member flying economy and reassured me I can stay in the queue. 

She comes back and yells at me again. In front of everyone. I refuse to be yelled at this way. I ask her why, since the sign says Flying Blue Gold. She says the sign is wrong and rudely asks me to leave the queue. I tell her this is not a way to speak to people, comply and join queue no. 3 as instructed to avoid further trouble. I speak to her colleague who is checking passports in queue 3, and re-iterate that this is not a way to speak to people but the colleague confirms that I was in the wrong queue because my zone is not written in my ticket. I try to show her my gold flying blue card, she says it makes no difference. She is almost as rude as her colleague but her attitude mysteriously changes when I give her my green card. 

I fail to understand what is the point being a gold member if we receive such a treatment, and if our gold card is not even a proof of our member status. Actually member or not, no human being should be spoken to that way and it is a disgrace to human rights. I have traveled for years with Air France and Delta and was never subjected to such a treatment. It is really shameful that staff is trained on these grounds in the middle of the 21st century. 

My guess is, my Lebanese passport had something to do with it. I wrote to Air France but my case was blatantly dismissed. They didn‚Äôt even provide a valid justification to the treatment I received at the airport, but they kept insisting it‚Äôs non discriminatory. My question is, if it‚Äôs not discriminatory, what is it about? Still no response from them so far. It‚Äôs been over a month.",2020-02,2020-03-01,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
The best,Paris,Beirut,International,"The last time i flew Airfrance was in 2014, i don‚Äôt remember exactly the experience so it must have been fair.

Where to start from? 
The aircraft Boeing 777 so no need to tell you how big and comfortable it is. The cabin inside is very clean and neat that you feel it is shining.
The aircraft has a wifi service with various packages. 
The crew is very professional and supportive. 
The food is good balance and healthy.
The inflight entertainment is among the best i ever seen. It is a touch screen with variety of services. They also offer a forward camera where you can enjoy the takeoff and landing live as if sitting with the pilot. 
There‚Äôs an extra advantage if you are an elite frequent flyer where you get priority in boarding and fast track facilitating your journey in CDG terminals even more.

Ruined our 25th wedding anniversary,Paris,Vancouver,International,"After a lovely 25th wedding anniversary for 2 weeks in Paris, we left on January 1, 2020 for our return home to Canada. Our flight was to go from Paris to Amsterdam to Vancouver. Well, Amsterdam was fogged in, so our flight was cancelled. OK, you can't control the weather. We were then re-routed on a much later flight from Paris to Montreal on Air France, then switching to Air Canada from Montreal to Vancouver, feeling grateful...    We were ASSURED (famous last words) that our luggage (which had already been checked in for the Paris to Amsterdam to Vancouver flight) WOULD follow us on our NEW route...  NOT!!!! My husband's suitcase arrived 5 days late and my suitcase just DISAPPEARED for SIX WEEKS!! The tracking number on my suitcase stated that it had gone from Paris to Montreal... then  SWITCHED to a DELTA flight ???!!!  to Atlanta and finally arriving in Baton Rouge???!!!   REALLY!!!  WHY????  No customer service rep could help us - we called 2 to 3 times a DAY to try and get help from agents in Baton Rouge - no one answered the phone EVER!! I just kept getting blown off by airline reps and the World Tracing service, based in India, was useless.  I finally just resigned myself to the realization that my suitcase, with ALL my beautiful clothes, shoes, boots, coats, makeup, perfumes (I was going to Paris for goodness sake - it was my anniversary, I brought all my best possessions!!), Paris purchases/souvenirs had to have been stolen at the Baton Rouge airport by somebody seeing that my suitcase wasn't being claimed by anybody!! No kidding, I was in Vancouver!!  Well, six weeks goes by, I am shattered by the loss, it has ruined my 25th anniversary - which only comes around ONCE in a lifetime!!  Then, 6 weeks later, my husband and I get a call and an email from a women in Baton Rouge asking us if we had lost a suitcase - OMG!!! She had had it in her student complex office for SIX WEEKS!!!  being held for a Louisiana State University resident???? with an entirely different name than mine (yes, my name was on an ID tag on the suitcase!!!) well we just about fell over in a dead faint.... apparently that student had been travelling and when she returned the office asked her to come to the office and get her suitcase - when she saw it she said ""that's NOT my suitcase"" So then the office staff LOOKS MORE CLOSELY at the suitcase, SEES my name tag and calls/emails me. When I questioned them as to HOW they got MY SUITCASE, they said that a DELTA  AIRLINE AGENT had delivered it to them from the Baton Rouge airport!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?????????? REALLY!!!!!
Thankfully it was all still intact with all my precious possessions safe. BUT THIS IS NOT OVER YET!!!  Instead of calling DELTA to pick up my suitcase, I thought NO WAY I am EVER letting that dreadful airline anywhere NEAR my suitcase again - it could end up in RUSSIA for all I know - so ludicrous.  So we call Fed Ex, and after SO many ups and owns with them (read Fed Ex reviews for a laugh - their overall rating is 1.2 out of 5 stars - dreadful)  we FINALLY got my suitcase back in Vancouver 14 days later (vs. the PROMISED 6 day delivery!)  BUT I HAVE MY SUITCASE BACK AND MY 25th ANNIVERSARY FINALLY HAS A HAPPY ENDING!!!  I just aged TEN YEARS in 8 weeks :(
Moral of my story - read the Air France / Delta / Air Canada / Fed Ex  reviews on Trip Advisor - they are all dreadful - how do these companies remain in business????  And NEVER check in your luggage if you can help it - we are going to Japan next week and Peru in July and we are BOTH doing carry-on only!! NOW we understand why SO MANY people do carry-on - they obviously have been BURNED like us!!!

Definitely an improved service,Panama City,Paris,International,"It's some years since I've flown Air France long distance (from Addis Ababa and to Santiago) when I would have rated them as average, but this flight was much better. 

On a long overnight flight, the quality of sleep is critical, and I found the lie-flat seat, which was wide and comfortable, and the offset or herringbone arrangements of seats made for an uninterrupted and refreshing sleep. The meal after take off and wines were excellent and the next morning's breakfast good. Service for both was efficient and helpful.

I didn't use the entertainment system much but it seemed to have good film and music selections and when I did use it the picture and sound quality were good.

Perhaps the greatest improvement was the friendliness and helpfulness of the cabin crew. My recollection is of efficient but rather distant cabin staff, but things seem to have changed.

He asked me to check in just my luggage, which I did happily. This took us an extra 20 min as the credit card machines where down. When returning, he then asked us to reweigh my boyfriends luggage and asked for him to checkin his, which made us miss our flight. When working our way back to the checkin counter, the attendant was not helpful at all. We ended up booking on our own. When arriving at London, we went to track down my luggage and it was not in the system. I wanted to file a claim and no one from Air France wanted to help me. When I flew back to LAX, I had to file a claim with British Airways, as Air France in both London and LA didn't want to assist.

Air France airport staff were not helpful. Need better and more consistent communication/information sharing with passen,Tel Aviv,Paris,International,"I have just returned from an international trip with Air France and found their communications woefully inadequate. When one member of our 46 person travel group lost her passport at the Charles De Gaulle Airport (CDG) in Paris their Customer Service reps made a call and told us they had found it and it would be brought to their desk. After waiting for a while they said it would be with our Gate Agent where we were waiting to board. The Gate Agent said they knew about it. After three attempts over the next 2 hours back and forth from Customer Service to Gate Agent, a supervisor told me there was a mistake. She said no one had asked for a lost passport by name (not accurate) and they had found another lost passport so they thought the search was over. Very confusing and not helpful.

On our return we arrived just before 5:00 AM from Tel Aviv at CDG with a connecting flight to Atlanta scheduled for 10:35 departure. About 8 AM someone noticed on the board at our gate that there was a gate change (from M50 to M27). At 8:18 I received an email notification that the scheduled time of our departure had been changed to 12:00. Shortly after we arrived at M27 we noticed on the board that we were now moved to M23. Not long after arriving at that gate another board announcement said we were moved to M49- at the other end of a VERY long concourse just across from our original gate M50. 

12:00 noon was supposed to be our new departure time. At about 10 minutes after noon there was an announcement that we would begin boarding soon. This was the FIRST announcement of any kind made to inform passengers of what was going on. We were not told that we would not board the plane at the gate but after lining up to board the flight we were loaded on buses and transported completely across that vast airport to a waiting flight with only external stairs to enter the plane. Finally at 12:45 the flight started it take-off.

Not until the plane was fully loaded was any announcement explaining or apologizing for the delay.

If it was a mechanical issue, there is nothing that could be done about it but the lack of information increased everyone's anxiety and irritation. Surely this situation could have been handled better.",2020-02,2020-02-27,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0

I have flown Air France a few times in the past years and honestly it has started to decline so much lately with the struggle to keep up with this cheap travel that young people are doing nowadays. 

Dear Air France,

If you believe in yourself, keep your service good and keep your prices normal and trust me people will fly. We want to fly to the most magical city in the world on the most magical airline in the world. We DO NOT want to fly to the most magical city in the world on that nasty thing you call an airline.

Seat room was ridiculously tight for a transatlantic flight,Paris,Toronto,International,"We flew on a shared Delta Airlines / Air France route from Edinburgh to Paris CDG, through transit to Toronto. Nice airplane, good food, etc. and on the way back, the pilot advised us that our plane was brand new, only 2 months old.

That's all wonderful, but when the seats are so tightly packed together, it makes for a very uncomfortable flight. I personally feel airlines shouldn't be allowed to operate long-distance flights with this legroom. And yes, 6 hours is a long distance when seats are packed so closely together.

Also, on the return flight, we had one lovely stewardess and one not-so-nice. I suffer from IBS and had a sudden attack, just after dinner when we still had the food trays on the tables. I struggled to stand up, trying to juggle my tray and put my table up, even though I had an aisle seat. Then, when I got to the back of the plane, I couldn't see the toilets. On this new plane, they were situated right at the back, not on the sides where I expected them to be. By this time, I was desperate and asked the stewardess who was in a central kitchen where the toilets were and she snapped at me, Just round there. I still couldn't see them because she didn't add that they were flush with the back of the plane, not off the aisle as they usually area.

I had to ask her a second time and she wasn't any more helpful, but I did eventually manage to find them, no thanks to her.

Originally, I was really pleased to see that we were on Delta / Air France, believing in the standards of comfort that these two big airlines used to offer, but not any more.",2020-02,2020-02-26,3.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

So to recap, their proposal is leave 09:00 to arrive at 21:40. For a flight to Ghana. Not Hong Kong, Ghana which is around 6 hours away.

Air France - a total joke when it comes to inflight service,Paris,Seattle,International,"The flight staff was nice enough but I now understand the jokes about Persians having poor work ethics.  These people were truly pissed off that they had to provide service to the customers.  They would disappear and show up at some random point in the flight carrying a bottle of water and what amounted to dixie cups for drinking.  They were so stingy with their offerings it was if the cost was coming out of their pockets.  The food was awful - the food was left in plastic for the customer to unwrap and provided wooden flatware, a piece of fabric was your napkin, and everything was in plastic.  The staff should have stood at the front of the plane and thrown a bag lunch at you as you were taking your seat.  I thought Southwest or some of the other US discount airlines were bad - Air France made these discount airlines look like luxury.  Air France brochures touted their top rate chefs that prepared their food for flights but it was no better than something plucked from your freezer section and microwaved.

airfrance damged my luggage,Paris,Zagreb,Europe,"Given the chance that you are in our shoe, what would you do for a situation summarized below:
1.Luggage damaged upon arrival in destination airport.
2.File a complain with the luggage desk in Zagreb airport.
3.Received a full report of the damage luggage.
4.Start searching shops to get a new luggage but fail (travelling with two kids along)
5. Upon finding a new luggage in a public bazaar/market, pay money and change to a new luggage.
6.File report to Air France upon returning to home country.

The above is what a wise person (including me) will do upon knowing a luggage is damage and not do the following questions you asked in your email response below:

1. The receipt for the cost of repair to your baggage or a written confirmation from the stockist with the following specifications:
-The age and the current value of the damaged baggage (do you keep track of when you buy a luggage??)

-A confirmation that the suitcase cannot be satisfactorily repaired (confirmation from who? a luggage repairman in the middle of Zagreb??)

2.The receipt for the exact replacement case or the original purchase receipt for the damaged case if baggage is irreparable (does bazaar/market in Zagreb issue receipts for luggage or any other goods??)

We spent around Euro80 for the new luggage and if that is too much for Air France to compensate, keep it and we won't fly anymore. Your email respond hurt us further...

At the airport we had our boarding passed on my phone and those for my friends, Air France staff were extremely helpful in advising us and getting us to the check in desk with what we needed, then my Albanian friend was told she could not board the aircraft because she was not an EU Citizen, I explained that under new rules France accepted visitors with non-EU passports and that I had spoken to the French Embassy in London to confirm she could enter France, it took around 20 minutes but Air France staff were willing to make enquiries and investigate the situation rather than just refuse to assist, they completed their enquiries and my friend was allowed to board the aircraft having no problems entering France at the French Customs in Paris.

ORD - CDG in Business,Chicago,Paris,International,"Found a solid value for a biz award seat from Chicago to Paris.  This was my first time flying Air France on an international itinerary.  Aircraft was a newer A330-200.  

Air France lounge at Ohare is small and pretty low frills.  Certainly does not compete with premium airport lounges, but really how can one be too unhappy with some free drinks and a soft chair before a flight.  

Business class seats looked to be new but I really did not like the size of the foot well when you layed down in get pod. The pod near the foot kind of came to a point and it was quite uncomfortable IMO.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11‚Äù so I can imagine someone who was tall may really not enjoy it.   Another issue is that I felt the screens on the middle seats were way too visible to the seat mate.  Seeing the other screen is distracting.  The inflight entertainment system is large and has a nice selection of titles.  

The business class bathroom near the mid galley is wonderful.  By far the largest aircraft bathroom I‚Äôve seen.  Was easy to change without twisting into a pretzel.  

Air France flight crew was very friendly and kept our drinks filled until it was time for a snooze.  

It‚Äôs hard to complain when you have the opportunity to fly premium cabin overseas.  I‚Äôm always grateful because I know what the alternative is, and that‚Äôs not very fun.

"Friendly staff, good food with rather limited menu, entertainment so-so",Manchester,Pointe-a-Pitre,International,"There is no direct flight from the UK to Guadeloupe, so we flew from Manchester to Paris (Charles-de-Gaulle), transferred to Orly by coach and so to Pointe-a-Pitre. The first flight was thus a short hop; barely up (& time for a drink & snack) before coming down. We had also to collect baggage at CDG and find the desk for the coach tickets from the 2nd floor of the concourse, only accessible by lift & then back down to the bus station. CDG has a rather unfriendly feel.

The coach journey took about 50 mins, allowing time at Orly to check-in (another security queue) and board. Again, there was a delay before take-off. The cabin staff were efficient & the food provided was above average, although the menu was limited, given that we were in Premium Economy. We liked the reusable cutlery! However, in-flight entertainment was disappointing; screen quality wasn't great; choice, although most of the films had an English soundtrack available, rather limited. 

On the return, about half-an-hour was clipped from the flight time from PTP due to a tail-wind. Breakfast wasn't served (turbulence) and only a brief apology was given. Again, coach transfer worked well; at PTP we had been given tickets as well as a combined boarding pass. Landing at MAN was bumpy; again, due to the wind.

Overall. pleased with the experience. The Air France staff were by & large helpful & friendly, the planes were clean & tidy. The only slight niggles - the lack of breakfast and the limited entertainment options.",2020-02,2020-02-22,4.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

"Much to love, but inherent hiccups",Malaga,Vancouver,International,"There are so many things Air France does well. From the warm real fabric hand towels to the entertaining safety videos, champagne, cognac and madeleines you will get in petit peu ( a little bit) of French culture on every flight. 

Add a wonderful selection of movies and mid-flight ice cream snacks and even a nine hour flight with a stop over in Paris can be enjoyable.

What didn't work for me were other points the usual customer might not experience.

I was traveling with a physical injury and requested assistance to reach my connecting flight to Air France. #1 problem: their website interface for assistance did not appear to work, but they did get my message.  If you need assistance try the website, but follow up at check-in to make certain they get the message. 

When I arrived in Paris I was met at the gate by a wonderful agent with a wheelchair who whisked me off quickly. I was seated away from my traveling companions so asked the agent how my family would know where I was. He did not know. Neither did they, but they assumed I was okay and would make my flight. *If you need this option assure your family you are in good hands. Sometimes they can move with you. Check. 

After a few special bus trips being usher about by people who did not communicate what was happening I was taken to a special lounge where I was told there was a bathroom, coffee, water, etc. I was seated in a comfortable chair and was confident that I was in good hands. ..until I tried to use the bathroom. Attendants were quick to tell me that we would be moving soon(not so) and that I should stay seated, because we would be moving soon. They then returned to discussing football with their friend on their mobile. 

After at least 3(4?) moves within Charles de Gaulle I was finally moved to my flight, after I heard at least three announcements across the PA system calling me to my flight. My family were concerned that I was going to miss my flight. While there were thoughtful services provided for handicapped flyers, it was difficult to convince our handlers to allow us to use them. This too is French culture. Do not be surprised if there seems to be a disconnect between your problem and their service.  "" This is not my problem!"" is a response I have often experienced in France. It is not specific to Air France staff. 

The second problem I faced was that our luggage did not make it from Paris to YVR with our flight. It arrived looking very rough and 24hr+ late. It happens with all airlines. 

I have flown airlines based in Canada,USA,  Japan, Europe, China, Australia and South America. While Air France is not my favourite it is certainly one of the best. At a corporate level they aim to please and provide a good service. (Maybe it is because I have learned that they are backed by Delta Airlines, who cater to North American standards...in a French way.)  At a human interface level there are things that they could improve upon, but what is new about that in an airline?",2019-11,2020-02-20,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
Needed to return home unexpectedly,Venice,Paris,Europe,"First time I have ever used Air France and the customer service was exceptional apart from one little hiccup at the check in desk.I always just carry hand luggage but I was told my case was too big even though I explained it was taken on other air lines . Air France policy checks the luggage width ways opposed to length ways and because of the wheels  on my case it would not fit fully in their designated case checker so I ended up paying 45 euros extra . 
However I would definitely use this airline again and recommend to others .",2020-02,2020-02-20,4.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

Trials and tribulations of flying,Paris,Montreal,International,"I have flown air france at least 25 times in the past years and always found it ok. 

This time however the airline had 2 things to contend with. The poor weather in Montreal and the ongoing controllers strikes in France.

So although we boarded right ontime we were still nearly an hour late taking off due to a lack of runways open.

Landing in Montreal was in a snow storm with many other flights cancelled or delayed but the pilot managed to circle and put us down accompanied by applause from the releived passngers

I can only say that this was not the best flight I have taken with nearly 9 hours in the air compared with the normal 7.5 hours and at 83 years old I have difficulty sitting for long periods

Pre Flight care LOW,Toulouse,Pointe-a-Pitre,International,The first leg of our flight from Toulouse to Paris Orly was changed ...an hour later BUT they failed to tell us. I only noticed a day before when I downloaded their app. It meant that we only had an hour 15 mins transfer time in Paris . They said it was enough...it may have been but we didn't want to take the risk of missing our flight to Guadeloupe and I have a heart condition so I didn't want to be running through the airport. We couldn't change it on-line and couldn't get through by phone so our son travelled to their Toulouse office and changed it to a flight 1 hour earlier. They declined compensation because they said it allowed enough transfer time. They ignored the fact that they hadn't told us of the change. When we did fly the 777 on the flight to Guadeloupe must have been very old because the in-flight entertainment was very small and low res. It was like going back 20 years.

Wish I could make my rating zero,Canton of Geneva,Paris,Europe,"Just got off the phone with Air France. They are a sneaky, underhanded organization that, in my opinion, should be sued for illegal practices. I wanted to rebook my teenage daughter's outgoing flight because the one she booked would have her travelling alone at 1 am and spending 3 am onward in the airport alone. Yeah, teenager made a dumb mistake. I get it. So I was willing to rebook her outgoing flight and pay full cost and suck up the cost of the earlier flight. Except Air France says I have to rebook the ENTIRE flight because they will automatically cancel her return flight when she doesn't show for the earlier flight she booked!!!  Yes, a flight that was paid for and not cancelled by the customer is going to be cancelled by Air France with zero refund or recourse. Period.

Tight 76cm legroom in Business Class are a shame,D√ºsseldorf,Tel Aviv,International,"The first leg from DUS to Paris CDG short haul was operated by Hop!, which is the LCC of Airfrance. The trip started chaotic already at the Airport around noon time, after the entire security zone of DUS was closed for a few hours from the morning due to a security glitch. All pax had to leave the airside zone, and re-do security check. Hundreds of people were queueing not only at security, but a lot of them also had to be re-booked due to missed flights. Despite Priority, and only 6 pax in front of me it took more than 1 hour to drop the bag, because every other minute another pax in a hurry was waived through to the counter for re-routing. That only 2 of the 3 AF counters were manned at all, certainly didn't helped. One can't blame AF for the chaos at the Airport, but certainly they were not appropriately prepared for unexpected situations like this, when the regular checkin counters are left alone to deal with everything, while understaffed anyway. After all we made it just a few minutes before boarding to the gate, just to learn that right at boarding time a gate change from B73 to B55 was announced. Rushing to B55 just to learn, that the flight would be delayed by round 30 min, melting down the 1h transfer window at CDG for connecting. (Fast forward: Finally we made it in an incredible short time of only 16 ! min from arrival at Terminal 2G to T2E hall L, including bus transfer. We even could visit the Lounge at CDG for half an hour. Good job, AF!)

Back to Hop! from DUS-CDG:
They used an EJet170, the first 3 rows are Business. 2-2 cabin, no blocked neighbor seat, but a reasonable 79 cm leg room (which is even 3 cm more than on the second mid haul flight on AF. Crew and service nice, decent food, despite the short flight.
Fun fact: The Airfrance pricing is considered odd, when a round trip DUS-CDG costs as much or even more than a connecting flight DUS-CDG-TLV.

Boarding call for AF1120 to Tel Aviv was also round 30 min delayed, plus 10 min waiting in the bridge, before we were allowed to board. Took off 30 min delayed.
Metal this time was A320 in a 3-3 cabin. Blocked out middle seat in Business, but naughty 76 cm legroom only, which used to be pretty much economy standard still a few years ago.
Flight time from Paris to Tel Aviv is around 4 hrs. No IFE, just a bord magazine. The USB plug at my place was defect at this time - good I always bring a power bank to charge mobile and tablet.

The food was very tasty as usual with AF, but the service was below par this time. The FA was most of the time busy with pleasing members of another crew that was transfered to TLV for the return flight, and sat the row in front of me. Whenever it was unavoidable for her to service me too, the FA was unconcentrated, brought the wrong meal, didn't offered buns nor drinks, want to remove the food tray while I still was eating and so on. In the end even a lady just across the aisle, who had noticed the mess for a while, started apologizing to us. It turned out she was the head purser of the other crew that was on their way to TLV for the return leg. And she did half of the job including removing the tray, glasses. Wouldn't that be a genuine part of the FA on duty?

Finally we arrived short before mid night in TLV, half an hour delayed. Luggage came out quickly within a few minutes after landing, also customs and immigration was smooth as always at Ben Gurion Airport.

In the end I would rate the flight 3.5 out of 5, despite serious short comings not worth a Business Class medium haul flight. Esp. the leg room is a shame. But I would round it up to 4, since the price was right, and they offer a decent amount of XP points for this flight, which makes it easy to manage keeping Elite Plus status on SkyTeam, while flying this route a few times per year.",2019-03,2020-02-17,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0

Customer Service is Horrendous - Bags Lost and Items Stolen,Paris,New York City,International,"I am appalled at the horrible Customer Service of this so-called top airline. 

I sent in a claim for my missing baggage. I followed up with Air France and Pacific Atlantic Handling regularly. In the end, I took matters into my own hands and tracked down my own luggage because all Air France could say is ""Sorry, we don't know. It's not in the system. We can only send messages in the system, etcetc"". I called the different airline offices at the different airports that my bag may POSSIBLY be at. Turns out the Air France employees at different offices do NOT know how their own system works. They do not use it to provide updates nor do they even check it. Nobody at Air France is willing to directly contact their own offices because it isn't what they do. Maybe Air France should be training their people better. I was sent in circles to the same departments within Air France AND Delta, but in the end, nobody was of any help.

First of all, I found my own bags, organized the return of my bags, and followed up with the bags because NOBODY was providing any information or updates. I said I wanted to PICK UP the bags, but they sent it for delivery. I called multiple times that day to make sure that I can PICK UP the bags, but in the end, they sent it out for delivery. Once I received my bags, I noticed right away that it had been opened. I had explicitly said on multiple calls NOT to open my bags as I had put locked on them. These bags were NEVER supposed to be in cargo, but because of a full plane, I was forced to check them in (alas they then proceeded to lose them). Several random items were STOLEN from my bags, and stuff broken as well. Items were all thrown into the bag messily after somebody had gone through them to take everything he/she wanted. I followed up with my claim with all the stolen items listed. No response. Nothing.

My original Claims Manager Edna C Feliciano stopped responding. Then, a Carla Johnson responded saying to contact Delta instead. No information on how to do that first of all. No follow up from my supposed Claims Manager. NOTHING. This is beyond frustrating, as it seems my emails go into a black hole. Nothing in my emails have ever been properly addressed including any questions I may have had.

This is a Summary of two Air France Flights,Seattle,Paris,International,"Our first International Flight from Seattle to Paris was amazing!  We sat right behind first class and we had plenty of leg room :)  We were very surprised to discover that this Air Bus had cameras from the pilot's perspective and there were cameras on the belly of the plane so we could view what the pilots were seeing and (because we did not have a window seat) we could see the earth below.  Sadly, during the day, the sky was overcast and the majority of the flight was at night.  When the sun came up we were over Ireland, then England and onto France.  Incredible!  There was a map that was offered as part of the video library so we didn't ask ""are we there yet""? 
When we first boarded the plane, the staff gave out a package with eye shades, ear plugs and socks and there was a pillow and blanket waiting for us.  Prior to landing, we received a package with a toothbrush (and Paste), a spray bottle of water to mist, and a small cloth. When we were about to land, one of the staff was serving the first class fliers wine and slipped around the curtain with the bottle, he gave us commoners a taste of French wine, oh la la!  Along with these creature comforts we received two meals (dinner and breakfast), snacks, and beverages with an endless choice of recently released movies.  
Now for the bad:  We were flying from Paris to Florence and arrived at the airport 3+ hours early.  We did not get a boarding pass.  We were anxious, being we were from another country and did not understand the language.  We asked for help and we were passed from one agent to another, to another, to another.  We hopped all the way down the ticket desks, no one could or would help us until the very last ticket agent.  We were told that we checked in too late.  Wait! What?!  We checked in over 3 hours early! So we were put on stand by.  We were unable to gain access to that plane and were told that we were on stand by for the next.  We were unable to access that plane.  I was in tears, how could this be?  It was our anniversary, what a memory to have!  The agent told us what was happening to us was illegal by their standards and compensated us for our luggage, comped us with a lunch voucher and access to Air France's club (oh so nice) and comped us for a majority of our tickets to Italy. This came in handy when we visited one of the vineyards in Chianti county were we took the compensation from Air France and purchased a case of wine and had it shipped home.  So, despite the frustration, a day spent in Charles De Gaulle Airport, and the multiple delays, Air France did us right in the end.",2019-09,2020-02-12,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,5.0

Two weeks before the flights i found the seats had been cancelled and the person i spoke to on the phone was most reluctant to help and would only give me a seat right by the toilets and away from my partner. Ok, so be it. Then this was cancelled on the day before the flight by which time the website showed no more suitable seats available.

We spent well over 2 hours on the phone attempting this with multiple calls.  Both the www.

So all well and good, finally arranged the seats for going out and coming back.      So we were absolutely astounded when we were ready to check in for the journey home to find the seats had been re-assigned.    I must however say that the disabled assistance was second to none.

BandC,Havana,Paris,International,"The service we received at Havana Cuba airport was lacking to say the least. We had a 2 hour delay and offered the most disgusting sandwich - no choices. 
On board Air France was absolutely abysmal.  A 9 hour flight. Their lack of customer service was just unbelievable. The staff were shouting at passengers because they wanted drinks. We asked for water and were told to go and get it ourselves from a trolley at the back of the plane and when I picked up a bottle that was 2/3 full I was questioned was I going to drink it all and when I said yes she was shocked. Some people stood up in the aisles and were commanded to sit not very politely.
On arrival at CDG we headed for customer services because we had been booked on a later flight without being advised in Havana and had a 4 hour wait for our flight to Manchester.  My husband queued for an hour then I queued for an hour bearing in mind that the same 2 people were ahead of us in the queue for the whole time. The queue didn't move in that time. Then the woman on the desk told us that she was too busy to help us and she was closing the desk. At that point we had been travelling for 25 hours. 
I would have given zero but cannot write a review otherwise. I strongly advise that this airline be avoided at all costs. We only used it because Thomas Cook had gone bust. But thankfully Thomson are now flying to Cuba so Air France we don't need to use you again.

Air France does not have the word service in their vocabulary,Paris,Montreal,International,"My flight Paris - Mtl was overbooked when arriving at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. I ended up 5 hrs later in Mtl than planned, had to pay double for my luggage as I had not been able to check-in online and they don't offer options to reserve a seat and pay for your luggage when physical documentation checks are necessary. But worst, crew was incredibly rude during the flight. I was not able to close the overhead bin after taking out my earphones and asked for help. The crew member kicked on purpose my neck pillow that had fallen in my efforts to help her closing the lid. When I addressed this issue with her, she did not even acknowledge it and simply walked away. During the meal service they skipped several rows for drinks and coffee and I got an angry face when I asked for my coffee. Then they did take away everything but the tray and never came back to get the tray. I waited for half an hour having asked for assistance, no answer. I finally ended up discarding the tray myself.
Now getting compensation for the delay and an answer to my complaints has been a nightmare. We are 1 month later and I still don't have answers. I keep calling their 'customer care' which turns out to be their sales center which doesn't want to give me the real customer care number or put me through.

Entertainment was quite good too an extensive selection of movies although not as extensive as emirates. The negatives for me were the small seats as mentioned it was very difficult to get out for bathroom and a bad thing for me was the service, they gave wine with the meal but then you had to help yourself to soft drinks only and no option of alcoholic drinks at all, I found this very unusual because they should be happy to offer alcohol throughout the flight and it‚Äôs nice to have the service to you not waiting in queues to get your own drink this also led the very crowded aisles.

Meh at Best,New York City,Paris,International,"Flew on Air France (operated by Air France as well, not their codeshare partner Delta) in January 2020 on a red eye from NYC to Paris in economy.  

Positives: Airline queuing in the terminal was actually pretty orderly (weird to mention, but if you've dealt with the disorganized chaos that sometimes happens, this was a plus).  Also - the service on the flight was relatively good for an airline like Air France.

Negatives: I have never been on a plan with such little leg room (and I have been on a good number of flights).  I am 5'11/150 lbs and could not sit in the seat without having my knees slammed against the front seat and squished against the sides.  When the passenger in front of me reclined - forget about it - I had a hard time even standing up to go to the restroom.  This made an overnight flight extremely difficult and uncomfortable.  My flight back was during the day, which made the lack of room a bit more doable.

Also - the airline is a bit crazy with baggage.  I have a true carry-on that I brought from NYC to Paris, no problem.  On the way back, the airline made me check it - and pay a 50 euro baggage fee - even though the weight and size were exactly the same.  I could see that they were requiring almost everyone to check their bags regardless of the size (and of course pay a fee).

I would not fly them again and, shockingly, would even prefer their codeshare partner Delta if I had to do the same flight.",2020-01,2020-02-04,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0

You do get extra legroom but only if you do not slide.  When sliding you actually hit the front ""shell"".  Very bad in comparison to Lufthansa's Premium Economy class.

Not great,Fortaleza,Paris,International,"Wasn't impressed with this at all - the business class cabin was cramped in comparison to other carriers.

Not the most comfortable A380 experience,Mexico City,Paris,International,"This is not the most comfortable configuration of the A380 - sears do not fully decline and the reduced comfort is not conducive to a good nights sleep. 
The food offering is no more than reasonable- does not compare with the offering from Qatar Airways for example. 
Service was good - despite some bickering between crew members audible to passengers - certain crew members went beyond the normal level.

"Good onboard entertainment, good punctuality; nothing else",Buenos Aires,Paris,International,"To say that France is meant to be the culinary capital of the world, the food was awful. Dinner was a dreadful pasta dish that I took one bite of and left, there was an inedible crumble desert, the only highlight was the plastic cup of water that I was given and breakfast was an uneatable pastry which was greasy, full of stringy cheese that practically chokes you when you eat it and rock hard fruit to follow.  The tea that they served was cold and as weak as water, and the bread roll was a hideous sweet doughy mass.

The entertainment was good, with a fine selection of recent films, classics and TV shows in various languages.  Also games and I always find it fun to follow the flight on that map of the world.. However if you want a decent viewing experience try to avoid travelling cattle class (sorry I mean economy).  The seats are way too close together both in front of you and the person at your side.  If you have one of those annoying people in front of you who insists on leaning their chair as far back as physically possible then its virtually impossible to watch a movie as the screens do not rotate to allow for the angle of the tilt of the chair in front of you.  I had to politely ask the woman in front of me to move forward as I was unable to watch my film.  The woman at the side kept digging in me as she desperately tried to find a position of comfort in which to sleep. Might I add I struggled with that too.

The air con is way too much.  I spent the flight practically freezing my pants off with only a wafer thin blanket that they offered to provide you with any thermal protection.

During the quieter times of the night they did leave water,coke etc at key strategic points so that if you felt thirsty during the flight you could help yourself. A fairly international mix of crew and passengers.  The fight took off on time and arrived at Paris again on time and in all fairness a relatively smooth journey",2020-01,2020-01-29,2.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0
Extremely non-flexible flight change policy,Vancouver,Paris,International,"Horrible flight change policy. Even with the coronavirus, they only offer ""credits refund"" for flights directly flying into Wuhan. Which basically means ""no credit refund"" as no one would be flying into Wuhan at this point + the city is shut down. A $300 flight change fee is extremely unnecessary, simply for them to gain 80%+ profit margin. Bad and non-flexible service.",2020-01,2020-01-28,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0

This bad environment was confirmed to me by a member of the crew, when I mentioned my eye problem, who told me that crew were only allowed to fly two trips per week on this particular aircraft due to a potential cumulative affect of the bad environment (my guess is also possible contamination of the air conditioning system from the engines - more common than you may think but a problem not widely talked about!).",2020-01,2020-01-28,2.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,1.0

Excellent Service on my First Air France flight,Paris,Nice,Domestic,"This year I decided not to go to Paris for a night and take the TGV, but to fly after arriving at CDG from Toronto, to take an Air France flight to Nice. I booked ahead and qualified that my small dog would be allowed in the cabin. You are confirmed that there is space for your pet, but you must check in before boarding to let AF check your pet‚Äôs papers and pay 40 euros for the one way trip. I had my bag checked and when an attendant saw that this was my first time, escorted me to the place where my pet‚Äôs papers were check and where I would pay the fee,  Then she escorted me back to the checkin for boarding and made certain there were no issues before wishing me a good flight. The 1.5 hour flight was excellent - clean, good service etc and it was wonderful to get my baggage, leave the airport and hop on the new tram service into Nice.

Lost Baggage and Nobody taking Responsibility,Malaga,New York City,International,"Worst travel experience ever, and I have traveled A LOT. First time using Air France, and am very disappointed with their service. I am open to using various airlines, and was open to using Air France in the future, but never again. Air France joins my list of AA and United as never again airlines.

The flight was fine. However, the aftermath of this seemingly innocent flight has been a horrible experience. I believe they use Pacific Atlantic Handling (PAH) for their baggage related issues, but nobody seems to want to take responsibility for the lost bags. I asked the agent at PAH who takes responsibility for baggage issues, and says I could TRY Air France, so here I am. (will also be filing a complaint)

My two carry on bags were taken from me at the gate at Malaga because the flight was full. We were assured that they would make it to NY, and that we would just need to pick it up there. Well, surprise, the bags never made it. I had a trip the very next day, and needed my luggage asap. They assured me they would find it, and forward it to my next destination. It all seemed well and dandy when I received a message that they had found my bags the next day.

The bags never arrived. 

We checked every day we were at the next destination, and finally got a response that they did not know where my bags were. We went to check if the bags were at the airport, but lo and behold absolutely no open airline offices. I have returned to NY, and just checked. Again, they don't know where the bags are. However, they let me know the identification tags have been switched probably by Air France themselves for the expedited flight. That's nice to know NOW, but maybe this should've been shared when they actually expedited the bags. 

I asked if I will be getting updates on the bags, and received a No. The only update I will receive is when (aka IF) they make it to NY. I asked them to send photos of the bags when they find it, but that's impossible I was told. I also asked who takes responsibility, and PAH agent says probably Air France. Well, great to know nobody knows where anything is, and nobody is checking where anything is.",2020-01,2020-01-22,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
Horrible hassle to change Airport CDG-ORY for connection flights,Munich,Fort-de-France,International,"We will NEVER again book a flight with AF where we have to change the airport from CDG (International airport) to ORY (National airport). It was a nerve-racking hassle.
First you need to secure a place in LeBusDirect (the bus has 55 seats, so you can count the queue to check if you will make it in). At CDG you could not queue, people were standing in a swarm around the bus doors. To get from CDG to ORY took over 2 hours, because the traffic was so bad (was around noon on a Wednesday). The only reason we made in time for our flight to FDF (we had 4 hours 15 minutes for changing airports) was that we had Business Class tickets and could skip the queues in ORY for check-in and security (security fast lane was chaotic). Business Class was nice and seating was 1-2-1.The business class seating from FDF to ORY was 2-3 (!!!)-2 and the plane was very old, especially the TV screens. 
On our way back we waited a very long time for our luggage at Orly Airport (make sure that they put the priority stickers on you luggage at FDF airport). At ORY there was a orderly queue for LeBusDirect albeit very long and we just made it in. Traffic to CDG was also very bad.
Please note:
 I wrote to AF regarding LeBusDirect and they basically wrote me that if you take LeBusDirect and you miss your connecting flight (the flights have to be on one ticket, e.g. MUC-FDF) it is the fault of AF and they have to book you on another flight.
If you take a taxi / uber and miss your connecting flight it is your fault.
Vouchers for LeBusDirect if you fly from Munich:
We did not get our vouchers at Munich Airport and had to ask for them at an AirFrance desk at CDG. BUT people we met who flew from MUC - FDF in Economy Class got the vouchers at check-in in Munich. So ask for a supervisor if they do not give you the LeBusDirect vouchers at check-in Munich.",2019-12,2020-01-22,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
Big disapointment,Brest,Hong Kong,International,"Big disappointment on my last trip!
File C-2924974
Flights Brest> Hong Kong
2 long-time Flying Blue passengers (2110495924 & Gold 1542682454)

Hello, I would like to report a huge lack of professionalism from airfrance. During the registration, my arrival but also during the processing of my complaint file.
We traveled the night of the 31st Jan from Brest to Hong Kong via Paris and this entirely on AirFrance.

1) During the check-in, the operator forced us to pay 100E of excess baggage without negotiation while our booking was as follows:
- Brest Paris (Charles B 1 Bag / Joyce C 1 bag + 1gold)
Total 3 pieces of luggage
- Paris HongKong (Charles B 2 bags / Joyce C 0 baggage + 1gold)
Total 3 pieces of luggage
So we did have 3 pieces of luggage for the entire trip.

2) This same operator forced us to transfer 2kg of clothing from one suitcase to another when one piece of luggage was only 10kg (We were therefore below the total allowance of 69kg (3 * 23kg) and no suitcase exceeded 30kg, maximum weight for a standard suitcase authorized by civil aviation).
Lack of professionalism and flexibility evident because she was alone and therefore the queue was growing behind us.

3) This same operator refused to put my spouse and myself side by side on the plane because we were traveling in a different category (gold vs explorer). Even when we told her that we could both be in the ""subcategory"". She did not try to find a solution because she did not even pretend to look at her screen.

4) Obviously all this with a total lack of friendliness. Not a smile not the slightest attempt at an arrangement to satisfy loyal travelers and this on New Year's Eve ... In short, Low Cost airlines do better and international competition is fierce, this is not a strategy to follow to continue .

5) My luggage was lost on arrival at HK. Luggage has since been found so nothing too serious.

6) So I opened a complaint file. And there, very ""malicious"" treatment on the part of AirFrance, because they do everything to discourage you from insisting on your request.
The person I had in contact had the following signature:
F. ................. S
Your Air France KLM Customer Service Assistant
Phone. : 09 69 39 36 54 (choice 4)
When you call this number, an operator answers to tell you that the only way to have your contact on the phone is to ask them by email to call you back. What I did and the email response I received was that this person could not respond to my request and therefore considered my file CLOSED. Unacceptable! Customer requests are therefore not even listened to!

I have received miles and a credit of 100E at expiration.
But that does not excuse the error of AirFrance nor the lack of professionalism of several services (check-in, logistics, and after-sales service) you wrongly billed me for 100E and I therefore want to be reimbursed for this amount on the credit card used for this payment.

I would think very strongly about the next company I would use on my next trips. I enjoy flying with Airfrance because I am French but I must recognize that Cathay Pacific (the Hong Kong company where I live does a much better job in terms of service, punctuality, flexibility and friendliness).

Kind regards,

Mrs,Prague,Cape Town Central,International,"Very disappointed.
My first flight arrives late and I had to run to even catch my plane, other people missed theirs and I could hear them complaining.
The flight was ok, very friendly staff, but the food was not nice at all. When I arrived in Cape Town it turned out that my baggage had been left behind in Paris. I was told by airport staff that I would not get compensated for anything I needed to buy. My baggage was brought to me 3 days after I landed and it had been emptied out. Most of my things had been stolen, and what was left was broken into pieces. Now I have been trying to get in touch with Air France and no one is answering.

"Terrible, frustrating, and traumatic, travek experience",Paris,Munich,Europe,"I will never fly Air France (or Delta again).  
In summary, an Air France emoloyee was extremely rude to me.  When I responded in kind, Air France denied me bording (stranding me in Paris) and then extortionately demanded that a pay for a new full fare ticket to return home on the next available flight. 

The issue began when a horrendously rude check in agent charged me a 45 Euro overweight bag fee for a bag that I had flown to Paris with on Air France days earlier, which had not changed in weight, and for which I was previously not charged a fee. When I challenged her about the fee she was extremely rude and unprofessional.  I asked for her name so that I could mention it in a customer service complaint and she immediately hid her name tag and refused to provide a name.   I snapped a picture of her instead (to include it in the complaint) and she then refused to issue me my boarding pass, demanding that I delete the photo before she would give me the pass.  After about five minutes of back and forth arguing she finally relented and gave me the boarding pass.  As I turned to leave, she sarcastically wished me a happy flight which led to a mutual exchange of expletives between us.  I then left the counter and proceeded through security and waited about an hour to board the flight.  However, when it came time to board the plane, Air France gate agents intercepted me and told me that I was being denied boarding because I was ""rude"" to the check in agent and ""needed to learn a lesson."" 

Air France immediately offered to book me on a later flight but only if I was willing to pay more than 600 Euros for a new ticket ... which I refused to pay. When I asked the ticket agent how I was supposed to fly home he laughed at me and told me it was ""my problem to figure out."" 

I ended up having to book a one way flight home with another airline which increased my total travel costs by several hundred Euros.

Will never book a flight from this airline again - Especially if you needed language assistance,Hanoi,London,International,"We booked the flight for our parents from Hanoi to London over the Christmas period. Since they are quite old and not used to travelling, we have asked for the assistance at the transit hub in Paris. We were willing to pay extra on top of the high price for the tickets (¬£1200 pp - ¬£2400 in total). 

However, they said that type of assistance was not available and gave us a wheelchair instead. This is insane, our parents aren't having problem with walking, they only need language assistance or a guide since it's their first time flying transit. 

It was horrible, not to mention that their luggage also got delayed for almost a week while being transferred in Paris. They said it was due to the ongoing strike in France, and gave no apology whatsoever.

Something special,Paris,Dubai,International,"Flying Air France La Premiere is an amazing experience that starts as soon as you reach the airport.

Food and drink there is of the highest quality and it is an oasis of calm in the busy airport. 

When it was time to board our flight we were again taken by car directly to the plane and escorted to our seats via a dedicated door on the plane. On the Boeing 777 the La Premiere cabin consists of only 4 seats, which convert into full size beds.

Unfortunately, not even 20 minutes after scheduled departure time we have not move from the the gate. Another 10 minutes later our captain has just announced, that due to the bird strike on the previous flight from Paris, we need to change some part of the airplane and it will take min. 2 hours. I absolutely understand that safety is the airlines priority, but the behavior of the crew was absolutely unacceptable. Based on this information I have decided to get offloaded from the airplane and convinced my 3 friends traveling with, to do the same, because due to this major delay we would not be able to catch our flight from Paris to Mauritius. I have started to question the crew to get more information about rebooking my trip. They were very arrogant and I have been even told, that I need to wait what will come up. They did not provide me any information when we would be even able to continue to our final destination. They have provided me with the phone number of local office which was closed of course already. Imagine to spend one or maybe more nights in Paris I have insist to get offloaded. I was strictly told by the crew that it needs to be approved by the captain. He has just stated that all of us or none of us can leave the airplane. Not individually. So, we were waiting and the atmosphere on board went worse and worse. The people were getting nervous and upset, because for many of them Paris was not the final destination. After 2 hours of waiting the captain has announced that they have found the spare part on the stock of Czech Airlines, which was off site, and they are looking for the suitable truck to bring it to the airport. Well... In the mean time I was really trying hard to get offloaded myself and my friends from this flight. I have been told by the crew many times to get back to my seat and wait. By fortune the local ground staff has appeared in the airplane explaining the Czech speaking travelers the whole situation in their native language. I have taken this opportunity to ask them for help to get us off the plane. Nevertheless, the crew was trying to bully us. They have stated if we will get offloaded, it is on our own risk and they are not responsible for our flights anymore and we are giving up the possibility to travel at all by losing our flight tickets. Just because I was standing firm we were finally offloaded (4 of us and 2 other passengers in total) and the ground staff has rebooked the same flights for the next day. We have got off the plane almost after 4 hours on board. As I said first, I absolutely understand the matter of safety, but if the captain knew that the airplane needs to be serviced, why they have let us to board on? Why the crew was not providing any information of the connections and they kept us waiting as the hostage on the runway for 4 hours? The other day all flights were operated on regular basis. Unlikely we have arrived to Mauritius one day later then scheduled. Because we had to pay the no-show in the hotel as well as the late cancellation fee for airport transfers on the final destination, I have decided to claim at least some money on Air France. According the EU regulation 261/2004 we should be entitled to get EUR 600 each due to delayed flight more than 6 hours. I have submitted the claim online and then the other story has begun. I have received a message back that we are not entitled to get any refund, because the bird strike was not under airlines control (the bird strike has not even happened on our flight) and this is like force major. As a good gesture from their side there was a voucher given for EUR 150 to me. Because we were submitting our claims separately, my friend has received the voucher for EUR 200 and the other two friends were given only 100 EUR each even booking the same class and flight tickets. This behavior of the customer care I consider as absolutely unacceptable. What kind of the game they are trying to play with us? I have replied to this email that I do not accept the given voucher and still insist to get at least some money to cover my loss. The clerk just replied back to me in gruffy tone repeating still the same and sending me another voucher for 50 EUR more. Like a broken CD. Finally, I have tried to get the guaranteed upgrade to the business class at least on my trip home at least. Another 72 hours no reaction from the customer care? Really? They do really care or not? And at the end of the day again the same reaction. The voucher for EUR 200 or nothing. Take it or leave it. Because of this I have decided to create a legal court case out of it as soon as I return to Prague. Therefore, I would like ask to all passengers of this flight AF1583 scheduled on January 5th, 2020, who has got in troubles as well, to contact me on conspiracyofone@icloud.com in order to file a collective action. It is not about money for me anymore. I still believe I have some rights and the customers should be treated with respect and polite way. And one point at the end. Air France?

They are the Spirit Airlines of France,Paris,Milan,Europe,"Last Spring, I was in Europe for the first time.  Since I was in France, I thought I would support the local company Air France.  Boy was that a mistake!  First, I had a standard 20‚Äù carry on luggage.  They said it was too big so I had to check it in. I didn‚Äôt think that was an issue since I‚Äôm going to another country, Italy. When I checked it in, it was 75 Euros since my ticket does not include check in luggage! I‚Äôm going to another country, I should be allowed two check in luggage for free.  I guess since Italy is part of the European Union, they don‚Äôt consider that flying to another country.  I showed them that I had Delta (their SkyTeam partner) American Express Platinum card so the check in should have been free. They knew nothing of it so I had to pay as I had no choice. 
Second, I went through security. This terminal only serves Air France.  As regular US rules, I took out my ipad from its sleeve.  When my jacket went through, an older guy screamed out ‚Äú√âlectronique! √âlectronique!‚Äù as if he just saw a bomb.  Since when are digital cameras dangerous? A younger man told me to take out ALL of my electronics. I went through again without any issues.
Third, I arrived at the gate about 2 hours early.  I waited and wait but not many others came to the gate.  As it was almost 45 minutes to departure, still not many were at the gate.  Then I found out that there was a gate change so we all made a mad dash to the new gate.  Why wasn‚Äôt there any announcement or posting of a gate change?
Fourth, the new gate made everyone ride a bus to the plane.  This would make me very upset if I had a premium ticket.  As with all airlines, those with premium status or tickets are first to ‚Äúboard.‚Äù  When you are first to board the bus, you are the last to get off the bus!  There were no special bus trips for those members. So your premium status or ticket doesn‚Äôt mean much anymore.
As a testament of the ‚Äúnot another country‚Äù policy, when I arrived in Milan, I didn‚Äôt have to go through customs. If I fly in Europe, Air France will be the LAST airline I use or maybe I‚Äôll just use the high speed rail!",2019-04,2020-01-16,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0

"Overall, not bad",Lome,London,International,"Flew Lom√©-Paris CDG (via Niamey), then Paris CDG - LHR and then returned. Flights were all on-time and although crowded there was decent enough legroom.

Food was a mixed bag. On the way out a pretty revolting chicken and spaghetti dish. Why we were served spaghetti in the confines of an aircraft cabin is beyond me. On the way back to Lom√© however, it was a great improvement. A nice chicken and mash dish with good bread, camembert, and an excellent custard pudding. Air France app is worth getting. I managed to change my seat (for free) at the gate in Lom√©.

The entertainment system was fine but i saw some people complaining about the use of the touch screen.  I have flown AF several times but noted this time that the food was just ok.  I found the cheese plate and bread to be adequate at best.  The FA were friendly and attentive.  I know on night flights that people complain they disappear.  So what.  Go find them and tell them what you need.  Politeness but firmness is in order.  On our trip home i found the boarding to be a little chaotic and unorganized but once on board things were fine.  This FA crew were very attentive and very busy (looked like they might have been understaffed)  Again, when i needed something i didn't engage the FA light -instead I got up asked for what I wanted and told them i would be happy to locate it myself which lead to a response that ""I would be happy to get that for you"" probably if for nothing else than to get me to return to my seat.

Our seats were the lay flat style but for me they were shorter than I am tall (6'2"") so I ""reclined"" rather than lay flat. For me kind of restrictive but for the wife just fine. The dinner service went off just fine but it is still airline food (I'm jaded as I spent 30 years in the business). Entertainment for me was just so so but the wife liked what she found.

However, the shield between the 2 seats moves up- and down electrically and when down just touching with my elbow made it moving up all the time...
This time it became also clear that this superb A350 plane was originally ordered for Joon, the already abandoned low-cost project from Air France.

Best experience with AF up to now.,Paris,Cairo,International,"My wife flew on Miles collected by me and I was invited by the congress organisers, so we had 2 different booking codes.

The in fact too short flight for business class top experiences was excellent with a nice meal, good drinks, friendly service, good seating, some work and a part of a movie (second part on way back).

Longhaul -  Cape Town to Paris,Cape Town Central,Paris,International,"First time I had been on Air France, and can say our experience of it was all good.

The crew were great, the food was good. 

The entertainment was okay, but it could have had more recent movies.

Only thing that dissappointed me was that we had prebooked and paid extra to have seats that were as provided by the booking info, a little wider than the normal seat. On boarding our flight were found our seats to be two alone as requested, but still the same size as normal ones. If I had known that I would not have paid so much extra for this service, so felt a bit cheated!

Xmas Hols,Hong Kong,Florence,International,"Not a bad product. The seating arrangement is not my favourite but it was relatively clean and smart. Decor not much to write home about. 

Reasonably comfortable with no major issues on board. 

A few misses: toiletries in the washrooms weren‚Äôt available. 

Advertised meal was not the one requested and was only told about this when they served the alternative. More importantly in this case was the fact that the alternative was beef which not an issue for me might present issues for others. 

Service on board was friendly so no complaints. 

Our luggage however was delayed from Paris to Rome - if you offer a short transit connection then I would expect no issues transferring luggage to the connecting flight. Fortunately we were advised before we got to the carousel in Rome so no need to wait and got to process the issue quickly. It being Christmas Day it took another 24 hours to get the cases delivered to the hotel.

Delays & more delays.,London,Paris,Europe,"This was our first flight with Air France, they offered a range of flight times for a reasonable price for our short haul flight. And I liked the fact they offer a drinks service and a snack which is included in the price. 
Boarding in Heathrow was pretty well organised into zones and staff were making sure people were waiting until their zone was called. (Paris side didn't do this.) However, it is a bit annoying they don't board the plane from back to front as this does cause long queues to get onto the plane. 
The plane was fine for a shout haul flight, it wasn't particularly clean on either journey especially the tray table and cup holder. I also found leg room very limited. 
The plane was boarded on time, however we then waited over an hour on the tarmac, with very little information on what was going on. 
It was the same on the way home, however we were delayed due to the French Air Traffic Controllers being on strike (again!) Our flight was boarded about 10 minutes late, and then we we were told we'd be delayed another 40 minutes. After the 40 minutes were up, we were still sat on the tarmac with no information, I think in the end we'd sat there nearly 1hr 30 before taking off. 
Staff on both journeys were fine, quite abrupt at times but ok.

"Racial Bias, delays, cancellations and a terrible Customer Service.",Barcelona,Lima,International,"I can only define my experience with AF as traumatic, disappointing and shameful. The CO I was working with booked a flight from BCN to L√≠ma via Paris for me. The flight AF1149 was delayed in Barcelona for more than two hours, due to this delay the connection was missed by all passengers connecting from Barcelona through Paris to Lima on flight AF0480. The AF airport staff in Paris was not able to give good advice or reassurance. They did not speak any Spanish, did not offer any translation and I had to step in to support and translate for a number of Peruvian families due to be traveling on the same flight, and who were alternately being ignored and spoken to only briefly, angrily and in French. It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the passengers on this flight traveling on Peruvian passports, including me were dismissed by airport staff due to underlying racial and cultural bias.

After more than 45 minutes we were just offered a 15‚Ç¨ voucher for food that can only be bought at the airport and a one-night accommodation in a B&B more than 45mins away from Paris or any amenities. All the AF staff was very cryptic about our luggage location and none of them confirmed 100% where we were supposed to find it on the flight they gave us for the next day.

¬°This will blow your mind about the seats in A380 airplanes of Air France!,Paris,Mexico City,International,"If you are ready to pay extra for a better seat while booking a flight in an Air France A 380 airplane be aware of the seat configuration you will receive: In BUSINESS CLASS you get something similar to what you usually get in PREMIUM ECONOMY in some other airlines.
Seat space is tight but worst is the LACK OF PRIVACY. The seats in BUSINESS CLASS in this airplanes in Air France make you ride right next to another passenger, so if you are seating next to a window and want to step out of your seat, the passenger next to you must also stand up to give you the way. A most unconfortable situation in long flights where the A380 is used.
Usually Business Class seats are isolated in other airlines so you don‚Äôt have to struggle for elbow room with the passenger next to you.
Situation in PREMIUM ECONOMY is not better. If you pay for PREMIUM ECONOMY in Air France's A 380 be ready for this -which will blow your mind- SEATS DO NOT RECLINE. Yes as you read it, believe it or not, the seats are enclosed in a fixed cabinet that does not allow the seat to take something similar to reclined position, much less an horizontal one. What happens when you press the button to get a more confortable position is that the backseat SLIDES DOWN, But in does not flex back to allow stretching. It gets recumbent, but not angled-towards-to-horizontal.

Pretty Good Experience,London,Paris,Europe,"Business class on Air France Short-haul seems to be pretty similar to British Airways. 

We were not intending to use the AF lounge in Terminal 4 at Heathrow until we realised it was closer from the security entrance than the public toilets, so we used the lounge facilities instead. We only had a cup of tea in the lounge, but the breakfast offering in the AF lounge is one of the better ones in Heathrow.

Flying outwards we were in row 3 and my knees were pressing against the seat in front for the whole flight. I believe the seat-pitch is only 29‚Äù. However, there is a gap where the middle seat is kept free. On the return flight we were in the first row, where there is a lot more space, and this was very comfortable !

Leaving on the 06.25 am flight from Heathrow, breakfast consisted of two sandwiches, some cured meat, fruit, yogurt, a choice of croissant and/or fresh bread along with some tea or coffee. The crew were very friendly, and we landed 25 minutes early

We returned on the 07.35am flight and as we had eaten on our overnight connecting flight, we just had some tea and a bottle of water, although a similar breakfast to that on the outbound flight was available. Although departing about 30 minutes late, we arrived on time at Heathrow
.
The on-board safety video is quite cute, and it is good to see an airline trying to make this interesting and accessible to all passengers eg unlike BA‚Äôs recent offerings which are lost on many non-British passengers, and quite a few from the UK too !

Boarding at Heathrow was well organised but it was pretty chaotic at CDG, as there were nearly 50 passengers justifiably attempting to use the priority lane !

Although our connecting flight for the return flight to London arrived at the M gates, and we had to take a shuttle train to the K gates, this was pretty easy to navigate.

Overall, a pretty good experience",2019-11,2020-01-06,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0
Very Uncomfortable Angle Lie Bed,Paris,St Martin / St Maarten,International,"Our connection from the inbound flight from London was easy as both flights were K Gates in Terminal 2E. Security was not busy so despite only a 1 hour 35 minute connection, with the early arrival of our flight we had enough time to visit the Business Class Lounge. 

Frankly though, the Lounge is nothing special, being very crowded and more like a cafeteria. Whilst there was a good selection of food available, we didn‚Äôt eat anything as the food on our flight was more than sufficient for breakfast, and we would no doubt be eating soon on the flight to SXM. The coffee though, according to Mrs FB2000, was disgusting !

For boarding, it was quick to get through the boarding pass check, but we then had a 10 minute wait at the bottom of the walkway before the all clear was given and the barrier ribbon removed. 

On the outward flight to St Maarten, the crew were excellent, Mrs FB2000‚Äôs coat was taken to be hung-up in a wardrobe and the food and wine were excellent, especially the main courses. I had the Cordon Bleu Chicken and Mrs FB2000 had the Filet of Beef.

The In-flight Entertainment had a very wide range of choices, even for non-French speakers, and the amenity bag was very nice, but the contents of the bag not so nice !

I counted at least 9 other passengers on this flight who had also been in Business Class on the flight from London so this looks like it is an important source of passengers to SXM.

The return flight was very much the same but being an overnight flight highlighted the one major drawback of the A340s used on this route ‚Äì the bed is not lie-flat, it is only an angle lie bed, and it is very uncomfortable ! 

I found it very difficult to get much sleep, and Mrs FB2000 slept even less than me. It is surprising that in this day and age such an inferior product is still being used, and whilst I read that new lie flat beds have been introduced on some AF routes, it will take a couple of years before the whole fleet is upgraded. So beware, and check before booking business class on AF !

I would have given a good score but unfortunately, a low mark has to be given because of our inability to get much sleep.",2019-11,2020-01-06,2.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,5.0

Terrible experience,Johannesburg,Stuttgart,International,"We booked with another skyteam alliance carrier but due to a late depature we would not have made our connection and they booked us on Air France as our connection to the second flight was in Paris. At check-in everything went wrong when they booked me and my partner seats far from each other.  When we requested that they fixed it they just say they can't as the other airline already booked it that way.  When we boarded I asked if they can assist to move either one of us.  No help was received and I made a plan to move my partner.  
The plane was old and not comfortable at all with limited legroom.  The crew was friendly  but not over eager at all, the food was good.
We had anther Air France flight form Paris to Berlin, which was overbooked and also horrible assistance from the ground crew, no one seems to really know where you should be and each one of the ground crew sent you somewhere else.

Due to a storm arriving in Paris the landing was delayed by over 30 minutes but the information provided combined with the helpfulness of the staff made the tight connection in Charles de Gaulle possible
So very satisfactory overall. The only disappointment, although a real one was the surprise to have to pay for one suit-case at check-in: 65 Euros and going only!!

Lack of consideration by Air France for a cancer patient and blatant discrimination,San Jose,Paris,International,"I am a stage IV lung cancer patient with metastasis to my liver. It‚Äôs pretty serious but I carry on with my life and dreams.
My return flight to Costa Rica was delayed more than 5 hours at Charles de Gaule Airport. I asked an AF representative if they could put me up at a hotel so that I could lie down and rest. They said no. I asked if there was a lounge where I could comfortably lie down. They sent me to the airport emergency room, where the personnel said I could not lie down there. AF also gave me a ‚Ç¨15 credit for food. 
I was confused because I thought AF was trying to hep me, where in fact they were simply trying to get rid of me (a nuisance).
I find this lack of concern very typical of French agencies and civil servants. God forbid I had anything more severe!
I do not recommend Air France at all. They Dutch partners (KLM) are better. But avoid AF unless you want to be surprised in a negative way.
Strangely enough, during the flight a French passenger had a stomachache ache. A Costa Rican doctor onboard, whom I know well for his professionalism, attended him. What surprised me was how the French flight attendants went out of their way to bend the rules and help this guy. They allowed him to lie on the floor even through turbulence, where normally the passenger would have to go back to his seat. He got to sleep on the floor for 3 hours!
This is a classic example of discrimination where they help a French citizen but denied helping me, whose diagnosis was much more serious than this French guy.",2020-01,2020-01-04,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
"C'mon! You can do a lot better!  No wifi, substandard food, and crappy service",Washington DC,Paris,International,"Now I remember why I haven't flown Air France for a number of years. As an international airline, this is one of the worst. I flew 5 international legs with Air France over a 6-week period. I only did so to boost my Delta miles balance and so that I don't lose the existing miles because I haven't flown Delta in a while. Delta was the carrier when booking but Air France was the service provider. With the experiences I had with Air France, in retrospect I prefer to have forfeited my Delta balance. Air France is truly horrible!

This flight was a 777. The other legs were either 777 or Airbus 320. All with a minimum of 5 hours flight time and a max of 10 hours. When you are stuck on a plane for that long, you expect to get wifi.  Nope.  Not with Air France. I really got tired with the flight attendants BS'ing me that wifi is ""not available today.""  Well, when will it be available?  Seriously, I asked that question on my most recent trans-Atlantic flight. Finally a FA was honest enough to tell me what was going on. She said there was a ""security"" issue (I think she meant to say ""safety"") in that overuse of the wifi would cause the wiring to catch fire. WHAT?!? I don't think she relayed it correctly in English so I asked her to repeat that in French because I don't see how any wiring catches on fire with wifi use. Airplane wifi is accessed via satellites and an on-board router. Is she telling me the router catches fire? The more I tried to explain it to her the more I got a glazed look and she was thoroughly not understanding anything. She then tried to explain the planes are old and until they retire the 777 and 380 fleet there will be no wifi. I asked how long this has been a problem and she said ""early summer.""  I didn't ask but I assume there is wifi for first class passengers. I told her she should probably just go back to telling people there's no wifi and not try to explain why because it's not a good reflection on Air France (along with all their other drawbacks). 

So, after having drafted a couple of dozen emails and getting in a few hours work, I resigned to the fact that I won't be online until I land and will wait until the airport to send anything. However, wifi wasn't the only problem. There were USB outlets on the seat backs but they had no juice. TIP:  take an extra charged battery or two if your iPhone is running low. Your iPhone, iPad, laptop are the only devices from which to get anything done (without wifi) and your only source of entertainment (unless you still travel with heavy books). 

This leads me to the next issue - no seat back entertainment on the non-trans-Atlantic flights. Yep, stuck on a 5+ hour flight with nothing to watch since there is no screen. I was annoyed at Air France (for having high expectations - thinking they were operating in the 21st century like other international airlines) and myself for not having downloaded enough movies and podcasts since my last flight which was 10 hours. 

I was hoping my meals would compensate for the lack of wifi, entertainment, and customer service. Nope, they were really gross. Where was the French food that the French so often boast about?  The attached photo is of eggs and sausage. The caption (cat puke and 2 fingers) is what it looked like when I first unveiled the foil. The before landing snack was not much better - sandwich that was 95% thick bread with a slice of turkey (or was that ham?).  So, maybe the wine can make up for it.  Nope, one taste of the red and I was done. 

Unless I am forced to, I do not see myself flying Air France again. I mentioned why I did. Most of my destinations are serviced by other carriers.  The trick is making sure that who I book with is the actual service provider. 

If Air France wants to compete in the global market and earn customers who are not first class passengers, they need to do a lot more and look into why other international airlines are ranked higher in customer satisfaction.

We only had one round of water or drinks on about a 12.5 hour flight in addition to the 2 food rounds. When they brought round small ice creams they ran out and just rudely tipped the box upside down to indicate they were gone... No smiles, no communication pretty much throughout the whole flight. The stewards were nowhere to be seen and resented giving you anything - a self service approach to any water in the galley. The plane itself was old and tired, with a poor selection of films. To top it off, they left our luggage in Paris, and we didn't get it back till 21:20 the next day (which we had to travel back to the airport for) - we were on a treck and all our stuff was in the suitcase so had to buy several new items of kit as we were only told 'maybe' they would arrive.

Woeful customer experience with Air France,Hong Kong,Birmingham,International,"I booked a flight with Trip.com flying Air France, a return flight from Hong Kong to Birmingham. I was unable to fly on the outbound flight as I had flown to Europe a few days earlier on a Business Trip. I informed the airline of this (Air France), stating that I still intended to take the inbound (return) flight from Birmingham to Hong Kong. 

I arrived at the airport for the inbound (return) flight as per my itinerary, only to be told by the Air France staff that my flights had been cancelled and I would be unable to fly unless I paid a 500 Euros administration charge to get my flights reinstated. Air France had not informed me that my flights had been cancelled at any point, despite numerous correspondences during the prior month (including when I tried to check-in online - their only response was to tell me the staff at the departure airport would handle it... which they didn't!). 

I then had to pay a significant amount of money to fly on a flight that I had already paid to fly on. It caused me an incredible amount of distress and embarrassment as well as the obvious personal financial cost. To make matters worse, I was treated exceptionally badly by the Air France staff at Birmingham airport and during phone calls I had with them.

DO NOT FLY AIR FRANCE IF YOU LOVE YOURSELF,Nashville,Naples,International,"I was traveling to Italy for a wedding. My bags did not arrive. The staff was extremely rude and unhelpful. The airline provided information to track my bags, but it lead me nowhere. For three days I was told the bags were ""with a courier"" and there was no way to track their arrival. I wore the same clothes (including underwear for three days, and had to borrow clothes for the wedding (mother of the bride, sister of the bride, and best friend of the bride were all in the same situation). There is absolutely NO excuse for this. Ultimately we received our bags a few hours before departing to return to the USA.",2019-12,2019-12-31,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
Nearly but not Quite,Birmingham,Boston,International,"Flight out of BHX to Boston via CDG 21/12/2019 returning (same route) on 28/29th. Booked via Experian (seperate review) and 'billed' as a Virgin Atlantic flight which it clearly was not (again reserved for a seperate review of Virgin). 
Tried to upgrade from PE to Business on way out (wife bad back - long story) the lady at the AF counter at BHX was very helpful but unable to navigate through the Experian/Virgin red-tape; so we had to stick with PE. 
Reasonable flight out - apart from the fact that they allocated my wife a seat in a different row to me when there were plenty of seats free in PE; but the cabin steward quickly sorted that issue out. 
Managed to secure an upgrade on way back. Amazing how the AF/Experian/Virgin red-tape process had been resolved in a week (!). Journey back from Boston to CDG was one of the best ever simply because we managed to sleep for most of it (those Business Class seats are awesome). So why only an average score and the title of the review? 
On both outbound and inbound legs we had a 5 hour stop-over at CDG so on the way back armed with the BC tickets we made our way to the AF lounge at terminal 2E for a quick refresh and some coffee only to be ejected because our ticket only permitted us to use the lounge at Boston not CDG. 
Really AF? A $750 each PE to BC upgrade and you wont even let customers use the lounge for a stop-over between AF (Boston to CDG) and AF (CDG to BHX) flights......nearly but not quite!",2019-12,2019-12-30,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

Nice touch was that staff on both long haul portions noted that we were English speaking and always spoke English to us when they came with service offerings.

My flight from Rome to Paris got 2 hours delay and the only information Air France gave us was that flight departure was postponed again and again withou any explanantion. 
I had a connection in Paris and as usual got my tickets with at least 3 hours to avoid problems missing the connection. Because total lack os respect of Air France I almost missed the filght and lots of people on same situation lost their flight since their connection was not so good. When I took the filght, staff was upset and shouting with passengers. Very veru unpolite. We pay very expensive price including a high cost to choose seats.

Economy Premium only in price,Paris,New York City,International,"Ok, the price was only about twice the price of economy, the seats were wider and there was legroom. However, the seats don't recline only the seat base slides forward an inch or two. At first, they gave us the economy menu to later change it for the Premium economy menu, the difference was in the starter there were two tiny and I mean tiny pieces of smoked salmon, not slices plus salad leaves. The seating was well worn and I sat on several cushions as the foam in the seat was worn out. On the way back my travelling companion found a seat in economy and was able to recline the seat and get some sleep AF7. Not worth the money for the comfort the staff were very apologetic and fully aware of their traveller's disappointments and on the AF6 flight we were plied with champagne and they found us the extra cushions.

Flight crew were attentive in the premium economy but curtains do not block economy passengers from walking over to share the 2 bathrooms. food was tasty but we really dislike the wooded cutlery. Every mouthful tasted like wood and the fork split was a danger to passengers.

First leg of this vacation was Atlanta to Paris on Air France. Nothing major wrong, just a ho hum overnight flight. It was a smaller commuter plane from Paris to Nuremberg that had many other passengers asking for prayers, forgiveness of past sins and  last rites. The air pockets that we encountered were the worst many of us had ever experienced.

abhorrent flying conditions,Paris,Punta Cana,International,"Shocking! we still haven‚Äôt recovered! The aircraft was extreemely old/dated, with around or over 600 passangers on board There was no leg room, beyond the minimum and the corridors were so narrow that it was impossible to stand without pushing our bump in someone else face.
There were no air wents anywhere it was hot and stuffy, couldnt keep window shutter open due heat, made claustrophobia worse. the entertainment was a 20 years old napkin sized tv screen, with blurry pictures. One with broken pixels, film selections were absolutely ridiculous mostly french, there were no USBs just an old style double jack for dodgy earphones. No mobilephone meant we could not EVEN entertain ourselves with our own selection.
There was no food choice, cos they ran out woth option 2 less than halfway, serving 600!!
It took the crew 2 hrs to serve us after an hr of technical delay, no water offered.
The menu was chicken in coconut and pollenta and broccoli???? is not exactly a crowd pleaser is it? No wonder option 2 was consumed.
Kids ate only a roll and a little cake,as dinner.
Paris airport sucks on food, it had a Pret selling salads for 15 euro so we were not exactly prepared with back up supplies to fend for ourselves.
After this we weren‚Äôt offered food (miniature ice cream?) for over 4 hrs so my daughter went to beg for a bread roll from the steward. 
We also were not served with drinks just once. Only after being dizzy from dehydration and heat (hours) did we find out that  the plane turned self serving. (stewards was ignoring us not informing us and upon questioning pressing on talking french)
We had to crawl out our cramped positions and serve ourselves, with a devastaing few and constantly depleted selection of soft drinks.
this Constant ‚Äúcoming going‚Äù resulted not being able to sleep at all, or let others rest!
Because all this the entire duration of the flight, was horror long! truly was! 
kids were already in tears upon arrival about their ability to cope going home when the flight would be even longer due to another stop over.

Never in a million years,Atlanta,Nairobi,International,"We travelled from Atlanta to Nairobi via paris.

Meaning just a handbag and NO Small roller case or only the small roller case and NO laptop bag. To add on whichever item you choose has to be 12 kgs or less. By this time the passengers were frustrated and we asked to check in the small bags since from Atlanta there was no restriction on hand luggage as we bought items on duty free. They claimed it was impossible to check in the small roller cases with the gifts since the baggage doors were closed.

Pleasantly surprised by improvements in AF,Tokyo,Paris,International,"Very pleasantly surprised by AF. HAven't been with them for several decades, after an unpleasant flight. This time, improvements all round:
1. Leg room is sufficient and even comfortable.
2. Cabin staff friendly and helpful (in contrast to two decades ago when they were consistently surly).
3. Food is airline food, but quite edible if not the 'best of French countryside' as advertised.

A word needs to be said about CDG. Unpleasant, expensive, badly planned. Avoid that bloody airpot if possible. Coming from Japan, the she ripoff, lack of toilets, nd staff damn your eyes attitude was palpable. If I had been travelling from Singapore, the worlds best airport, I would have run amok.

lovely service and value,Prague,Taipei,International,"I needed to book a ticket to flying home for emergency this September and I was expecting to get a pricey deal because it was like a last-minute thing. However, AIR France just broke my glasses with an extraordinary bargain attached with a great service on board. I paid my round trip ticket for only ‚Ç¨550. Although I didn't pay for any checked-in language this price is still far out of my expectations (in a good way of course)
The entire cabin crew was just so hospitable and welcoming, during the journey I was always free to ask for any hot drinks and snacks. Everything went well and luckily I didn't get any bloody babies crying at night!

I will definitely choose to fly with AIR France again to prove this is not just a first-time luck!

First Class Even in Economy,Houston,Edinburgh,International,"I booked through Delta Vacations so I knew I was going on Alliance partnership airlines but had not before been on an Air France flight. I wasn't sure what to expect but I prepared myself for the worst since this was a long haul flight and I had back of the plane seats. To say I was pleasantly surprised is an understatement. I know I can always count on the Sky Team to have amazing on board attendants but they were really amazing on both legs (IAH-CDG; CDG-EDI). I have celiac and had to request a gluten free meal and they made sure to serve me separately to avoid cross contamination at all meals and the food was incredible! This was a 10-11 hour flight and we had dinner, snacks, breakfast, and nothing was spared. There were  blankets, pillows, in flight entertainment (movies including new releases, games, music) I was blown away. I can't believe I've been flying other carriers abroad.... Needless to say will definitely be recommending them and utilizing their services in the future.

Air France acting as low cost,Bengaluru,Madrid,International,"AF now sells cheap fares without proper baggage allowance for international flights and tricks you into buying extra luggage at the airport without notice, only when you check in you get to know. I purchased my ticket on cleartrip which didn‚Äôt specify the baggage restrictions. AF should ensure it‚Äôs third party vendors inform clients properly. So if you want to check-in your suitcase you need to pay 70$ extra per leg, so 140$ above the original price. 

Food from Bangalore to Paris was poor and from Paris to Madrid just average.

WILL PROBABLY USE AIR FRANCE AGAIN,Paris,Pointe-a-Pitre,International,"This was my first time using a long-haul Air France (AF) flight.  My review covers both legs of my return flight between  Paris Orly and Point-a-Pitre, Guadeloupe.  I will benchmark AF against British Airways, which is my usual long-haul carrier.  Ideally, I would have been able to give AF 3.5 stars.
Booking: on-line, through Expedia.  The booking made its way to AF without difficulty and subsequent on-line communications with the airline worked well.  This gave me increased confidence in booking through third parties.
Flight availability: getting to Paris Orly, from London, on the morning of my midday flight was too much of a stretch, so I flew to Paris the night before, with easyJet.
Online check-in: this opened 30 hours before the flight, allowing me to choose my seat.  
Baggage drop (Orly T2):  easy.  T2's a nice environment.  I was given a boarding pass to replace the one I had printed.
Security: a little slow, on a quiet day, even with the polite efforts of the immaculately turned-out ushers and usherettes.
Timekeeping: OK.
Flight safety video: yes, I really will comment on this.  While BA's grates, the AF video is an amusing piece of art.  You can find it on YouTube.
Drinks service: basic.  AF hands out a drink with the meal, enclosing a small bottle of cocktail.  Self-service trollies - for soft drinks only, I think - are then positioned at the galley.  (BA wins out.)
Cabin service: fine - but the aisle-patrolling done by many airlines' cabin crews doesn't seem to be the AF way.  Don't expect someone coming past with a tray of water and juice.  (BA wins again.)
Food:  the main meals were tasty, filling and comprehensive.  In particular, the cold breakfast was very good.  (AF just edges the BA food offering but might lose out to BA's new menues.)
Entertainment: on the B-777's, the entertainment systems looked dated and it was time-consuming to navigate through a basic library.  (BA wins,)
Cabin cleanliness: at the end of both flights the Economy cabin was very tidy.  This is probably more reflective of the tidiness of the passengers than the efforts of the cabin crew.,  (A win for AF - and for the French.)
Uniforms: the AF stewardesses have one of the most attractive uniforms in the skies.    Such a shame that so many of them - unlike the gate staff - opt for the trouser-suits.  (But still a win for the chic French!)
Complaint-handling: I reported a defective entertainment system to one of the stewardesses at the end of the flight.  How nice to see lovely her get some paper and note down the details (seat 49E).  So many cabin crew didn't do this.  (A win for AF.)
Will I fly AF again?  Probably - mainly by virtue of its route network.  But a major block will be the nature of industrial relations in France and the frequent disruptions to travel.  (This constrasts with problems with BA, which tend to be internally generated.)  I think this means that I should book with AF closer to the date of travel than I usually do.
BA or AF?  BA, by a whisker - but Qatar Airways leads both by a wide margin.

DISAPPOINTINGLY TIRED,Ho Chi Minh City,Paris,International,"The Sky Priority Package through booking Business Class was well worth it on this 13-hour flight. Apart from the long queues to go through passport control at Saigon airport, we were then able to bypass the even longer queues at security. TIP: the Sky Priority gate is at the extreme right hand side. The nearby Lotus Suite provides free food and drink and small, very clean, toilets. 
On board, although well-appointed, there weren't the reclining couchettes as on the Vietnamese incoming flight and the entertainment facilities didn't work for the first half hour of the flight. I had to move seat as mine didn't work at all and even then the handset didn't seem to be connected and the touch screen pretty unresponsive. The flight crew were extremely friendly and attentive and the food, as can be expected on Air France, as good as can be expected on a flight. However, bizarrely, we had a 3-course meal soon after taking off at 9.30 a.m and then nothing except the odd icecream for 10 hours, shortly before landing. It seemed the Boeing 777-300 was a little tired both inside and out and took nearly two hours longer for the same flight (albeit in the opposite direction) than its Vietnam counterpart by going over 100 mph slower.",2019-12,2019-12-20,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,4.0

DC trip 2019,Lagos,Washington DC,International,Air France flights are pleasant and without issues. The air hostesses are friendly and helpful. The food could be improved upon.

1 hr layover? More like 1 DAY layover!,Toronto,Marrakech,International,"Expedia marketed an Air France/Delta flight from Toronto to Marrakech. The connection was in Paris CDG and the layover time was 1 hr. The first flight departed 30 min late. When we arrived at CDG, there was no one to help us with our connecting flight. We ran around the terminal, looking for the gate, then realized the plane had departed. Then we had to find an Air France Customer Service desk that was open. Although it was only 9 am, the nearest desk was closed. 

The AF representative blamed us for being late. She offered us a substitute flight the NEXT DAY. We begged her to find something departing sooner. It was only 9 am. How could there be no better substitutes for the short flight from Par√≠s to Marrakech? She said there was the option to fly via Casablanca but that flight was departing around 12 pm and we were too late.

Our original connection time was 1 hr. Air France didn‚Äôt think it was too short to sell it. The substitute flight had a 3 hr connection but the AF rep said it was too short? 

She put us on a flight in the early evening, at 6 pm. We arrived in Casablanca and the Royal Air Maroc rep said we were too late to board the connecting flight to Marrakech. So we had to pay for an airport hotel in Casablanca and try to get on a flight the NEXT DAY. We lost an entire day of vacation and had to double pay for lodging.

To add insult to injury, the AF rep in Casablanca messed up our booking of the return flights. My travel companions could only get boarding passes for 2 out of 3 flights. They were almost stranded on the way home.

First time flying Air France and in Business Class,Zurich,Havana,International,"Used flying with Emirates Business Class Air France is definitely not the same.

The Business Class Lounge Terminal F at Paris Charles de Gaulle was good, Furnitures in a good condition, good warm dishes as well as a menu of the day. Also lots of plugs and USB ports!
The flight with the 777 in Business Class was good but during the flight to Havanna nobody took care of the toilet - toilet paper wasn't in the holder, just serveral rolls placed some where. Only short before landing the toilet was cleaned up.
It is strange, that there's only ONE toilet for Business Class AND Premium Economy!
Can you imagine how this is?
The Mneu was fine with starter, main course, desert and a good range of wine and aperitifs.
During the flight Business Class passengers coul get snacks and drinks.That is good!

On my flight back, the Crew was very attentive, took care of every passenger at Business Class and also took care that the only toilet is always clean.
The Business Lounge at Terminal E was the complet opposite of the one at Terminal F. Old and damaged furnitures, cramped with passengers, bad Air, door to showers was locked, no chance for a shower..
The range of food and dishes was, compared to the Lounge at Terminal F, less inviting..I haven't found any warm dishes.

I can't understand wy Air France isn't sticking to its rules for cabin luggage. In Paris CDG passengers were boarding with suitcases which didn't fit into the overhead lockers, nor under the seats. So all these suitecases had to get into the cargo hold. The Crew hat to write the tags, suitcases went to the cargo hold - but then the cargo hold port was blocked and a technician was reqiured. All the time a fully boarded A319 was waiting for the departure.

On both flights to and from Paris it wasn't a Business Class with the expected legroom - just Economy with the middle sat not booked.

All in all it was good but not as I am used to with Emirates Business Class
Air France has definitily some house work to do...",2019-12,2019-12-14,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0
"Airline is nice, but Charles De Gaulle Airport is the worse",Washington DC,Bamako,International,"I've flown internationally on Air France three times in 2019.  On all three trips, I was fortunately to fly in their new aircraft.  The flight attendants are great, the layout of the seating is comfortable and I had no complaints about the meals.  I did find the location of the restrooms puzzling.  On one flight, there was a restroom to my front, but not one on the other side, meaning folks on the left side of the plane had to go to either galley and cross over to the restroom.  Seems strange for as large as the Business Class section was, there were only two bathrooms.  After my first flight, I paid more attention when selecting seats.  The inflight entertainment is lacking.  Not many new releases, so I have yet to watch anything and normally just watch movies on my IPAD.  The only downside to Air France is the Charles De Gaulle Airport.  I have never seen gate agents more unorganized than at this airport.  You have a boarding time and I've yet on three flights boarded on time.  They first make you que up.  Then once they do let you board, you go through an automated ticket machine and then que up again on the walkway.  Why the second que; no idea but I've had to wait up to 30-mins in this second que.  Then they let you board.  You also have to go through security again.  I was surprised that after arriving from Washington DC, you have to transit security again.  Not sure if this is because of the layout of the airport or what, but if your flight is late arriving and you are push for time, good luck.",2019-12,2019-12-14,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,3.0819906910132473

Be vert aware if you book a flight through Experian you may well be throughing away your consumer rights,London,Fort Myers,International,"I booked a flight with Experian, on receiving the email confirmation a few seconds later I realized that I had made a major oversight, I had entered the incorrect return date, basically i had slipped and entered the following month. No problem I thought I will contact Experian Customer Services and cancel or amend my flight. However the line was busy and the recorded message suggested calling back when it may be less busy.
Again no problem I thought, I had 24 hours to get in touch, the following day I managed to get through to a call centre (not in the UK) who told me that, and to quote (which can be verified by someone who was also listening) 'that the terms and conditions state you have 24hours WITHIN THE DAY YOU BOOK to contact and change your booking.
Obviously you never have 25hours to do anything, even if you booked at 1 minute past 12 midnight you still wouldn't have 24 hours. I actually had in effect 3 hours to contact them. The experience and customer serviced at Experian are the worst i have ever come across in my life, No empathy, No advice!
I contacted my credit card services who totally agreed with me that the terminology is misleading at would take up my claim, but here comes the main issue: Air France took my money out of my account, therefore my Credit Card services could not help as it was a third party. I was advised to contact Air France but they just repeated that the contract was not with them but Experian.
Therefore I was left with no consumer rights or any comeback. I choose Experian as I thought they were a reputable company but actually they are a faceless organization with no accountability and hide behind foreign call centers.

The Japnese man being annoyed decided that he should take matters into his own hands and try to touch my son in an attempt to quiet him down. An altercation almost accorded, when we called the Airfrance attendant instead of coming to the persons that called her she dismissed us and went to the Japanse man and french women. Needless to say that we are a black family. What is funny about the situation is that they couldn't understand English, or pretended to, but gave a full account in French. The attendant only came to us after the family behind us explained to her what happened.

As a result 13 passengers were unable to board their connecting flight and they were stranded in Paris, some for at least two days, without any luggage,  jackets,  medication,  etc.

Ground staff trained in the traffic warden school of charm,Paris,London,Europe,I was flying back to London having taken an Air France flight outwards with no issues. On the return trip although my suitcase was under the required weight when you weighed it with my handbag it was over the weight. I had no issues on the outward trip. So I was shouted at to leave the queue and check in my bag and pay ¬£40 and wait 50 mins for the privilege of doing so. Seeing my suitcase was the right size and my handbag went under the seat the only reason for being so dictatorial that I can see was to get an extra ¬£40 out of me. My friends had been in business meetings all day and checked in at the airport only to find that not checking in as soon as the flight opened had meant they had been demoted to standby! Truly terrible experience. I made sure I flew with BA the week after which was a much better and no problems with cabin baggage.

Beware of Air France Airlines,Marrakech,Rome,International,"We had a TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE with your company. We (myself and my spouse) had booked our holidays from Toronto to Marrakech and Marrakech to Rome. Our flight from Toronto to Marrakech via Paris on Dec 6, 2019 until Dec 10, 2019 (Leg 1). Our flight from Marrakech to Rome via Paris on December 10, 209 until December 16, 2019 (Leg 2). Our final return flight from Rome to Toronto via New York on Dec 16, 2019 (Leg 3). On the first sector (Leg 1) our baggage was lost by the airline and after going to the Marrakech airport 3 times our luggage was located and we had lost a day. On the night before our second sector (Leg 2) we get an email from your company stating that our flight from Paris to Rome might be cancelled or rescheduled to Dec 17, 2019 due to the air traffic control strike at Paris airport. Seeing how this would effect our entire trip we went ahead and booked a completely new non refundable flight with Royal Morocco Airline from Marrakech to Rome and paid an extra CAD $700.00 as that was the only option available to us 5hrs before our original departure. Upon calling the customer service department for your company to get our refund for the second sector (Leg 2) we were informed that our flight was not cancelled and that the refund could only be issued in travel vouchers and the credit was only CAD $100.00, like is that a joke.  What flight costs only a $100.00 that our refund was so less.   Absolutely the worst customer service and the worst airline experience we had to deal with ever.

A Loss of Two,London,Dublin,Europe,"I cannot recommend Air France fo any traveler until they apologize to me personally for losing my reservation and luggage.
My two friends and myself were spending three days in London and three days in Dublin. After spending three days in London we were to fly to Dublin on Air France from Heathrow airport to Dublin airport via Paris, France.
It seems amazing to me that Air France recognizing our boarding passes at Heathrow
And then losing two out of three reservations in Paris. I spent two hours trying to convince them that we three were traveling together and that I paid for our tickets and Air France confirmed.
The ticket agent told me that she had to leave and that another gentleman sitting next to her would help me. Low and behold, he left to. Another ticket agent came in and we had to start all over again.
After two hours they said I have to buy two tickets. I showed this new ticket agent the receipts I kept on my cell phone and finally conceded two tickets were owed me and my friend.
After printing our tickets we asked them if our luggage was going to Dublin and she assumed us that it will be on the same flight (they weren't) but to be sure we were to ask the boarding agent at the gait if our luggage is on the flight as well.
We arrived finally in Dublin late and consequently missing our limo service.
So, you see, I cannot recommend Air France to anyone because they lied to me saying I didn't have reservations. Funny they had one of our group tickets but not all three of ours and then have the audacity to lie and say I didn't pay for them (always good advice to save receipts from credit card companies and confirmations from airlines).
I would give a zero rating but your sight requires at least a one.

The Most Uncomfortable Seats Ever,Milwaukee,Paris,International,"A huge disappointment all around. I have flown Air France several times and it was always comfortable and pleasant, not this time. The seats are horrible, like seating on a board for eight hours. They have recently refurbished their planes but have done a terrible job. My seat wouldn't recline at all, I just needed a little space to get my spine a little room, I ended up with the arm raised and sitting more on my side it was awful and I was in pain most of the trip.
The flight attendants were unpleasant, one even snapped at at passenger for asking if they had any Diet Soda. Apparently they ran out before they got to the main cabin. The food was not up to the usual standards of Air France either. 
I would usually go out of my way to fly Air France but not anymore, with the seats as horrible as they are I will be going out of my way not to fly Air France for the foreseeable future.",2019-09,2019-12-09,2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,2.0

I was flying with my partner and they would not let us combine the compensation to use it to buy one item. There was no compassion from the staff, they just stated this is what our rules say.

Two meals were served as part of the flight with no extra charge. Didn't pay for luggage. It was so nice to not have some oversized flight attendant banging into me every time they went up the aisle.

Business Class Cattle Call,Atlanta,Paris,International,"When we got to our gate in Atlanta, there were so many people! How can so many people get on the same flight? There was a separate line for the upstairs (business class) and the line took about 40 minutes to load. As it turned out, business class was to the left (upstairs) and something else - maybe upgrade economy (?) was to the right.

The seats were nice, and went flat to sleep, which we love. The crew was nice, but seemed overextended. There was a lot of confusion. The meal - a first for Air France - was forgettable. There seemed to be a lot of people in business class, it felt crowded, and it was noisy until the meal service was over. 

There was a lounge area forward where you could stand near the restrooms, and that was nice, not just for waiting for to use the restroom but to be able to stand and to be able to move without being told to go back to your seat.

The AF staff took very good care of us, answered questions, made sure we had seats together (even though we couldn't book them online), etc. The plane was new and clean, and the entertainment system provided great variety. There was even a nicely printed menu in economy, and champagne and wine were available with the evening meal, which was--for airline fare--decent.

Bordeaux to Paris by the skin of our teeth,Bordeaux,Paris,Domestic,"""Be at the airport AT LEAST THREE HOURS before your flight is scheduled to depart"" we were warned when we received our reminder that we were on the Air France flight leaving at 0600 in the morning. Being experienced and cynical, we made every effort to be there two hours before the flight left, dropping off our car and entering the airport to discover the only people there were a few still sleeping who had overnighted in the airport. 

From being the first two awake people in the airport (it isn't a large airport) we became part of a large, anxious crowd waiting for the Air France counters to open. At 5:30 am, people started sauntering in, booting up their computer, chatting back and forth, going for their coffees. We were business class, so once the counters opened, we were processed quickly. On the other hand, no hurry, the security people are not there yet, so we wait another fifteen minutes in the ""expedited"" line for security to open. All the personnel were very relaxed.

Once through, we went straight to the gate, the gate opened soon and people were welcomed aboard quickly. We didn't leave on time, but it wasn't as bad as it might have been.

I have added an ironic photo which I took while waiting for all the Air France personnel to arrive.

Dream Trip on KLM Dreamliner,Amsterdam,Atlanta,International,"We have a rule that if a flight is more than four hours, we fly Business or First. We expect a nice flight, and most of the time, that's what we get. Entering the Dreamliner was a whole new level of WOW for us. The flight, operated by KLM, was pure delight.

Each of the 40 (or so) passengers has a separate little space, and a bed that goes flat. The aisle is wide enough that you never bump anyone. There is never more than one person waiting for the restroom. You can control how much light the window lets in by adjusting its polarization. There is a shoulder belt, as well as a lap belt for take-off and landing.

The meals are ""anything - any time.""  I couldn't imagine how it could work, but it did and I loved it. I decided to have a mixed appetizer and a salad, and that is exactly what I got:  Appetizer assortment, very dutch, spicy brussel sprouts, tasty duck on sauerkraut, sausage on something, and Dutch marinated shrimp. Later tiny Ceasar salad with BBQ chicken. We hate waste. This way, you get exactly what you want, when you want it.

There are multiple options for charging all your electronic devices at once. There is a spacious tray that slides out from the armrest that you can put multiple things on. 

When you can eat when you want, there is no ongoing meal service with all the noise, and no time when you can't get up and walk or get to the restroom. We slept beautifully, and it was the quietest, most restful flight I have ever taken over the Atlantic, and there have been a lot. With the seats all separate and isolated, there were none of those loud alcohol-fueled conversations going on that make you want to kill a fellow passenger or two.

Many Mexicans in there, the ""service provided by Air France staff"", if we can call it like this,  was T E R R I B L E since the cancellation of the flight. It took more than 8 hours to solve the way we were going to go back to Mexico City. Nobody knew anything. All the passengers were left by themselves. no guidance, Nothing! 
We were lucky to get a flight to Houston the next day and then a flight to Mexico City. 
I can understand that cancelations may occur but it is the way the AIR FRANCE staff handled the situation. They didn¬¥t follow a protocole, Passengers get worried, angry and the only thing we want to hear as passengers is that you are in the best hands of professional people.

Disaster,Dubai,Bordeaux,International,"My mother was due to fly from Dubai to Bordeaux at 1:30 am on 10 December 2019. We were informed at 7:00 pm on 9 December 2019 by text message that the flight had been cancelled due to the strikes; and then informed at 9:30 pm by text message that my mother was scheduled on a flight from Dubai to Beirut departing at 10:25 pm that night (less than an hour notice). The flight would then take her from Beirut to Paris CDG and then Paris Orly to Bordeaux.  Resulting in over 23 hours of travelling time. 

We tried calling all 24 hour numbers in the UAE and France; and could not get through to anyone. We had several phones calling all the various telephone numbers; and after 30 minutes of waiting, the lines would cut. 

We therefore had to go to the Dubai International Airport to find out what was going on. We arrived at 9:40 pm; and were informed to go to the check-in counter to speak to a representative of Air France. There were no Air France representatives; and were informed that they were coming but to just sit and wait.

The Air France representatives finally arrived at 10:00 pm. This in itself was appalling. All news outlets have been annoucing the strikes all across France, which will impact all modes of transportation. I am at a complete loss as to how Air France did not foressee the problems that this would cause passengers, and therefore planned to have their representatives available at the airport to help them rebook flights.

The Air France representative proceeded to inform us that the strike was only today, and the flights would be back to normal tomorrow. Once again, I had to inform him that I had read on the news that the strikes will be tomorrow as well. 

We therefore finally managed to get my mother's flight re-booked to Thursday, 12 December 2019. 

Overally, the service received by Air France was appaling until the representative finally arrived to assist us.

The temperature in business class was way too hot and there was no way to adjust it for myself.  Finally, the service was honestly quite annoying.

Traveling with a Wheelchair Resulted in Missing Our Connecting Flight,Miami,Paris,International,"I traveled with my mother from Miami to Paris to Barcelona in October 2019. The flight itself was smooth, seats were comfortable enough, service on the plane was good.  Where I ran into trouble was the wheelchair access in Paris for our connecting flight. We initially took the wheelchair to the gate in Miami and it was taken to the luggage hold with tags to bring it up in Paris for use to get to our connection.  This was also noted in our reservation with a call to the airline and again at the luggage drop.  When we arrived in Paris - no wheelchair.  It was sent on to Barcelona with our other luggage.  We were left to rely on the wheelchair attendants at the airport.  They were disorganized, didn‚Äôt seem to want to take us from one terminal to another. There were multiple wheelchair attendant check desks and it was extremely difficult to get anyone to take you from point A to point B to point C.  The delay, delay, delay resulted in our missing our flight to Barcelona.  Not because our flight to Paris was late but because we couldn‚Äôt get the wheelchair attendants to get us from gate to gate in a timely manner.  We had almost 2 hours between flights so that was not the issue. This may not be an Air France issue but if not they should leverage their power to reform or change the wheelchair attendant company.  It was an extremely negative experience.  And it was a widespread issue. If you are flying Air France with a wheelchair either take it on the plane with you (there were strollers and walkers on the plane - had I known this was an option I would have done it) or allow many hours in Paris to accommodate for the delays.  Again - the Air France flight experience was extremely negative due to the mess at Charles Degaul Airport.  And we were not the only ones caught up in the mess. There were people in tears because they couldn‚Äôt get timely transport.",2019-10,2019-12-09,3.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

Rude Flight Attendants,Vancouver,Johannesburg,International,"We had three 10~ hour flights broken up with day long lay overs and while I loved the opportunity to briefly visit a few cities on our way to our destination, I would hesitate to fly with Air France again. The hospitality was lacking, which, when you're captive for 30+ hours, can be quite uncomfortable. I grew hesitant to ask if they could fill my water bottle, and I felt like there was attitude with the interactions we had with them. 

The food was, well, plane food, but I really expected more, considering that France is the culinary capital of the world. If they're going to spread the smiles and hospitality thin, then the least they could do is give you above average food. 

At one point, my husband was in the bathroom, and the flight attendant opened the door on him. He quickly shut it and yelled that he was in there, and she proceeded to open it again, demanding that he return to his seat because the seat belt sign was on. I felt that that was a blatant breach of privacy and it made the remainder of the flight very uncomfortable.

After 5 minutes waiting my wife got up to get a flight attendant who basically told me it was condensation.  I knew that already!!  They brought me napkins, replaced my pillow but the leak continued.  After 4 flight attendants came to see me one of them had the idea to place a paper towel with tape over it, which contained the leaking.

As for the Charles De Gaulle terminal 2, this was the wrost experience we ever had; no service, no proper indications in the airport; it was simply a nightmare.

High expectations - experience disappointment,Miami,Paris,International,"Aircraft was Airbus A380-800. We have flown the same airplane a few times before, different airlines, premium economy and business long haul routes. This on Air France was big disappointment, we paid extra for better legroom. On the first appointed seat the back rest was out of order and the staff could not fix it, the next seats had minimum size foldable tables, smallest I have ever seen, and no place to keep personal small belongnings, tablets, napkins or trash after the meal. We were told ‚Äùkeep the trash in hand, we come to collect it‚Äù. It took ages.  If you wanted a glass of water, you had to go and get it yourself from the galley. Not enough on an oversees flight.

On our route home my daughter had a large Teddy she got in Disneyland and the staff were so nice to her carrying it (shes 7) and just explained it had to go under the seat for take off and landing but she could have it wit her during the flight. She was delighted as she can be nervous at times.

was great........We flew on a dreamliner on the second level.  My wife didn't know it,

So went to airport 3 hours ahead of departure and sullen check in clerk told me flight was overbooked as is common practice and I was on standby list!

Best of the Worst,Paris,San Francisco,International,"Flying anywhere is horrible as airline execs cram more and more seats into each plane.   That said, in the past year I‚Äôve flown transatlantic on four different airlines and, although they were all uncomfortable because of the lack of seat and legroom, Air France was the least objectionable because of what they didn‚Äôt do.

AF didn‚Äôt serve a ‚Äúmystery meal‚Äù of ‚Äúbeef‚Äù as a Scandinavian airline or the very overcooked pasta/mush I got from a domestic airline.  Although the meal was unremarkable I didn‚Äôt need to check if the barf bag was in the seat pocket. 

Nor did it only offer water once on what is a very dehydrating flight as the other three barely managed. They even came around with the free wine and beer cart more than once.

For these reasons I gave them four stars. Otherwise they gave me just what I paid for-transportation from point A to point B.

"If they didn't use CDG, it would be much better- charles de gaulle airport is TERRIBLE",Boston,Paris,International,"If you want to see what a 4th world airport is like, try this out. They still haven't found a way to connect your plane to the airport, most of the time. That means it is highly likely you will need to go up and down multiple sets of stairs, stand for 20 minutes as a bus shuttles you to the airport, (literally only a few seats for 40 people), and walk outside with your luggage in the rain.

Seats in steerage have less leg room than most flights. Breakfast is just a terrible sandwich (That you would expect to find in a vending machine in a basement somewhere).

That said, they have an impressive movie selection, dinner was acceptable, and because it was our honeymoon, they let us stay in their lounge (one of the ways) for free, before the flight. This earned them all a 2nd star.

Worst airline I've flown with,Madrid,New York City,International,"I booked a direct flight from Madrid to NY with Air France, but for some reason they changed it to a flight with a scale in Paris. 

Also, I had my numbered seats for the return flight reserved but, for some reason nobody was able to explain to me, 6 of the 8 passengers weren't given seats on check-in, so we had to fly separated. There was no room for the cabin luggage, but the air hostesses, instead of bothering with giving a hand, asked me to turn other passengers's bags. And the icing of the cake: my child was sick and I requested a bag, and as I wasn't given any, she had to vomit all over the carpet, inconveniencing the rest of passengers.

Had to pay 70 euro to ammend the ticket, and have been unable to get any help from Air France. In the airport in Dublin I was referred to a hotline, when i called the hotline they filed a complaint for me, but days later i got a reply saying that the complaint had been filed to the wrong department and that they where unable to help. Later filed a complaint online on AF website with a request of a refund for the 70 euro, that I had to pay extra. Never heard anything back.

Eye opener!,Paris,Havana,International,"The most surreal flight I have ever been on from Paris to Cuba .  The crew delivered our meal around an hour into the 10+ hour journey and were not seen again until about and hour and a half before we landed.  People were just going up to the where the crew prepare everything and were helping themselves to drinks, icecreams etc.  It seemed they were the same people all the time, who had obviously been on an Air France flight before.

Disastrous Experience on Inter Continental Business Class,Paris,Vancouver,International,"Flew from BOM to CDG on AF217 & connecting flight AF 374 from CDG to YVR. Seat surroundings were unclean on both sectors.
Indian Vegetarian Meal confirmed by AF, was not on board. Both lunch and Pre Landing meal had pieces of some meats which caused mental stress and trauma due my religion being Jain and non meat eater since birth. 
Even senior air hostess confirmed that Indian Veg Meal was not there for me.
Response by AF guy mentioned pax need to pay money to get his choice of a la carte meal but there is no such option on AF website while making booking for business class. Also AF guy mentioned providing meal of pax choice is not part of contract between airline and passenger.

On the plus side CDG airport was clean and easy to get around, the flights were on time and the premium economy cabin on the Dreamliner was bright and spacious with big comfortable seats.
The service on board was efficient and friendly. The entertainment system was reasonably good but the WIfi did not work.
On the minus side the food was average at best and it did not seem to be a great deal different to the economy class meals.
The drinks service was almost non existent and on the return flight from Nairobi to CDG I had to visit the galley a few times due to thirst.
Another bad point was that even though this was a daytime flight the cabin was darkened, an age old method used to keep the passengers quiet!

When I arrived CDG I realized I am in the wrong terminal for my connection flight On Air France Because my flights was on emirates not air france  as it was supposed to be. it takes about 30 mins to change the terminal By bus including waiting time for the bus.

Air France ‚Äî Superior to Alitalia,Paris,Boston,International,"On the day we were traveling in late November from Rome to Boston, Alitalia was not flying non-stop from Rom etc Boston. So we flew from Rome to Paris on Alitalia, which was adequate, thanks to the fact that the flight was not full and I was asked to fly in an exit row seat which had plenty of leg room. Had I flown for two hours in my assigned seat just behind the exit row, I might have needed orthopedic surgery to move from my seat upon arrival at Paris, as the leg room was meant for persons under 5‚Äô6‚Äù at best. In any event, having now arrived at DeGaulle, I had the pleasure of flying Air France, notwithstanding that I was booked on economy. The flight was undersubscribed; I had an empty seat next to my window seat with adequate legroom and better yet  the person in front of me did not recline his seat much, if any at all. Contrary to Alitalia steward practices, none of the staff went to sleep during the flight. Moreover, the dinner was served reasonably promptly and it was much superior (including the wine) to what Alitalia now serves in economy. Kudos to Air France.

Unsure of this review,Oslo,Johannesburg,International,"Ok, let me clearify why I am unsure of this review. I`m unsure how to go about it, really. Let`s begin with the Osl-Cdg flight. first leg. No troubles checking in, boarding etc (I`ve been working at Osl airport for 13 years, so can`t really throw me any curveballs there). I am 185 cm, and i must say, air france is by far the worst airline i`ve ever flown on from a legroom point of view. I was hugely dissapointed by that. Service and crew was nice and all, no problem there, but comfort was horrible. Out of paris i`ve got an upgrade to business-class, route flown with an A380. Now, i just love the A380, it`s my favourite aircraft. And also, an upgrade from economy to business, i din`t feel it`s fair to complain, wich i dont. I had a very pleasant flight to Johannesburg indeed. But- here`s the thing. If I had payed full price business(as i do from time to time), and the A380 had been operating the route, i would`ve feel cheated out of my money. The business-seats on their A380 is really really dated, and they should not charge full price for these seats as with their new product, regardless of service on the ground. But again, i was upgraded, so it was a win for me regardless. But check what aircraft is operating your route before shelling out your hard earned money, i know i wil. So, for giving me good service, upgrade and all, i should be giving them 5/5, but looking at the bigger picture, i just can`t.",2019-11,2019-11-30,3.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

Then I check my bank account and Air France has charged me the total amount again (another $5,795.80)! This sent my account into debit. Not only did I have to pay an overdraw fee, but I had to transfer $5000 from another account which caused me to pay more interest on my home loan and stranded my wife in the city because no money on card (first world problem I know). I rang Air France to get this resolved, now the trouble starts. Air France took this amount out of my account without asking (stealing) stating it was a floating amount (security), which is absolutely ridiculous seeing I'd already paid for the tickets. They eventually refunded my money after nearly 3 hours on the phone, but I'm out of pocket because of Air Frances mistake.

The flight over was a bit bumpy so my comments may be conected to that fact.

Service was very minimal on this flight.  The flight attendants came through with the meal service shortly after reaching cruising altitude.  Once that was done they came by once more to pick up trash.  Then we didn't see anyone until about an hour before landing when they came trough the cabin with the breafast offering.

Three stars probably being kind,Mumbai,Chicago,International,"All the mechanics of flying were fine - seats, boarding process, schedules adhered to, etc., but the flights from BOM->CDG and CDG->ORD both had the absolute worst airline food and drink that I've experienced in over 30 years of business travel, including the last 5+ in international/global travel. I know it was only Premium Economy, but fake orange juice for breakfast?? (as in knock-off Hi-C) Breads that must have been weeks old, a wake-up tin of what they called an omelette was absolutely unrecognizable as eggs (are eggs supposed to be gray?), with sliced potatoes that were a similar shade of translucent gray? God-awful coffee on both flights, chicken that takes free-range to a whole new imaginary level. Ugh, the entire food show now brings terrible memories back even days later.

"Failed connection, flight was like a bus in the air, only with meals and extra payment for seat and luggage required",Bogota,Manchester,International,"We were booked Bogota to Manchester via Paris but for some reason or other at the Paris end, our flight was delayed leaving Bogota by two and a half hours on just 12 hours notice. One of the party actually received the delay details as we were sitting on the 'plane waiting for others to board to leave Bogota! Great timing and advance notice! And when we got to check-in at Bogota and the check in lady stated that we needed to pay for luggage (we had already paid over the odds for luggage) I was ready to hit the roof. To err is human, but to err when it comes to the modern connivance that is paying extra for luggage, I see red!

While there can be be no doubt that the dinner and breakfast served were most acceptable as in-flight meals, for the remainder of the 9.5 hour flight we were not offered any other beverage outside of these meals.

In the end, our delayed flight meant we missed our connection form Paris to Manchester and Air France organised the most ridiculous alternative -  a flight via Lufthansa from Paris to Frankfurt and then another flight back to Manchester from Frankfurt. With 8,000 steps (thanks to a fitbit watch monitoring) in quick time taken around two of Europe's biggest airports to make connections, one of the party with a chest infection, another with back problems and a third on blood pressure pills. Not acceptable for people of our age to be tearing around airport terminals with less than light hand luggage.

Thus we arrived home nearer to midnight rather than the original 6.30pm we expected to arrive back in the UK at. We checked ourselves and found that there was a flight out of Charles de Gaulle at 8.30pm we could have made, but there was no way we could contact Air France to ask why we had not been allocated that flight instead of the dual Lufthansa flights in the wrong direction.

As it happens, the one thing we learned was that Luftansa is a very good airline to fly with!

The other thing with Air France at the booking stage was that with their alliance partner KLM they now have a ridiculous booking procedure whereby you really need to NOT use something lke Skycanner to make your booking otherwise you will lose out through lack of information. They have this most ridiculous silver, gold, platinum and explorer status which Skycanner don't tell you about. KLM and Air France claim it's in response to customers wanting the cheapest form of travel so having an alternative where they can choose to fly without luggage. How anyone can travel long-distance without requiring luggage is one of the great questions of modern travel. 

As a result, they charge a whopping ‚Ç¨50 a bag and ‚Ç¨25 a seat each on top of the basic price you are quoted and pay for via Skyscanner. And we had to pay for luggage and a seat on each of the three flights out to Colombia and on each of the two flights back to England (although the third Lufthansa flight that Air France added did not ask us to pay for a seat or for baggage). Five payments each for luggage and seats, adding around ‚Ç¨1,000 to the basic price quoted by Skycanner and subsequently paid to some travel agent in Dublin is extortionate!

All in all, it was not a very pleasant experience, and now that we have discovered that we can fly Manchester-Madrid-Medellin thus avoid using either KLM or Air France, we will do that next time.",2019-11,2019-11-24,2.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0

Appalling treatment,Edinburgh,Antananarivo,International,"We booked in April to fly business class from Edinburgh to Madagascar for  an autumn holiday. 5 minutes before we were due to leave the house at 3.30 am on October 20th,I received a text to say that we had been downgraded from business to premium economy.
We are both in our late seventies and an11 hour flight in a cramped seat (I am 180 cm tall) was not what we had booked and paid for. Our complaints at the airport brought no redress and the excuse given was that it was a different aircraft with a smaller business class. Early booking carried no weight and I am forced to assume that since we booked early at a discounted price, compensation cost to Air France would be less.
There is a legal requirement under European law that sets the level of compensation for downgrading which is 75% of the ticket price for this distance.
Air France have sent us two 300‚Ç¨ vouchers which must be used within 12 months. These are no use to us and I told them I wanted a a cash refund.  Their  first response was to reject my request and to refer me to the booking agent Expedia.
Expedia confirmed that Air France are liable and I resubmitted my claim a week ago. I have had no response. Any company that treats its customers like this should not be supported and I would never recommend them for that reason.

"Smallest space under the seat in front of me I have ever seen, really.",Atlanta,Paris,International,"I had high hopes for Air France based on the reviews (except for lost luggage).  Not so much anymore.

1.  I had read rave reviews of the food, it was just okay.

"If I could rate 0, I would!",Vancouver,Paris,International,"Air France has got to be one of the worst airlines. My partner bought a round-trip ticket from Air France. The flight to France included a layover and the first part of the flight was through their partner airline 'Delta' (Vancouver to Seattle). At Seattle, he would have a 4hr layover and then board an Air France flight to CDG, Paris. When he tried to check in to his Delta flight the night before, he wasn't able to---but with no explanation as to why. Assuming it was a technical issue, he decided to just check-in at the airport the day of this flight. When we arrived at the airport, Delta told him he needed a ESTA because he had a layover in Seattle. When he had attempted to check-in the night before, and was denied, there was no indication that it was because he needed to apply for an ESTA. I strongly believe that it is the airlines responsibility to inform their customers of all paperwork needed to enter a country. So obviously he missed his flight to Seattle because his ESTA was only approved 10mins before the take off time. 

We then assumed, we could drive down to Seattle to catch the second half of the flight (Seattle to Paris). Delta kiosk told us even if we drove to Seattle, he would be denied on the flight because he had missed the first part of his flight. The only way to fly from Seattle was to ask Air France to release the boarding pass for the second half of the flight. At this point a man from Delta kiosk was degrading and condensending. He said it was out fault we didn't find out that my partner needed an ESTA and that 'He' had flown to 100+ countries and always knew to check all the paperwork needed to enter the countries. Forgive me for not being as wealthy and well-travelled as someone who works at an airline. 

We call Air France as we head out of the airport towards Seattle. When we get through to Air France customer service, a very rude representative tells us that my partner's ticket is non-refundable, non-exchangeable. She refuses to issue his boarding pass because he missed the first part of his flight and says its entirely our fault he bought an economy flight. Just because we don't have an extra $500 to spend on a business/first class ticket, we are blamed for not knowing we needed an ESTA. She then tells us our only option is to buy a brand new ticket. Which we do.

But oh no, no. The nightmare isn't over! His original purchase with Air France was a round-trip. So we assume that my partner will still have his return flight. When he gets to Paris to fly back to Vancouver, Air France kiosk tell him because he missed his first flight, he will not be able to use the return flight. After hours of debating with Air France, and proving he already had to buy a brand new flight here, they let him take his return flight. I am so shocked they even had the nerve to try and deny him his return flight. 

Moral of the story, do not ever fly Air France! Ever other airline makes sure to tell you what you need before your flight. Double check your paperwork and just don't fly with Air France!",2019-11,2019-11-18,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

Nasty,Los Angeles,Paris,International,"On my trip back from Paris to La I flew Air France. The bathrooms smelled like 30 years of dried piss.

Overall it‚Äôs not an experience, it‚Äôs 13 hours of next time business class. But the prices they charge are a bit crazy for the outdated seats. 
Oh the food was beyond disgusting. The staff was friendly but they seemed to hate being there. Maybe it was my airplain but this was some third world/ New York subway üí© 
I mean, how do you manage to frack up yogurt? And extremely cold bread is not appetizing.

The Crammed Flight,Tel Aviv,Paris,International,"This is a flight I have taken several times, so this review is a kind of synthesis, although mostly based on my latest flight experience. In addition, there is clearly a rant about the lack of additional service provided to the highest-tier of frequent flyers (FB Platinum / for Life), again based on multiple experiences. 
This flight is often packed and the issue is one of using an A320 for a 4-5 hours flight: comfort is clearly not there and there in that sense zero benefit for being FB. If you take into account that at TLV most of the waiting time is common pre-check-in security, rather than AF check-in, and that the lounge is not AF (and I regret to say clearly not the best lounge around by any standards), then the FB benefit evaporates. If you are a Priority Pass holder, then there is absolutely no incentive left to use AF. 
Recently, AF have been trying harder to acknowledge frequent flyers. On a previous flight (same destination) where we were travelling as a couple, they announced at check-in that they ""would keep the extra seat in a 3-row free for additional space""): but that clearly never happened. On a couple of other flights, we had a 'special welcome' thanking us for being FB, but that was basically paying lip service to ... a lack of service. Only once we were served drinks from the business class section, but that was the best and only we ever got.
On my latest flight, I have tried to take up the upgrade offer at ¬£136, which popped up at check-in. When completing payment I was thrown out of the web site with an error message clearly attributing this problem to the web site. I was then checked-in automatically with no option to modify. When I phoned FB the following day (which was still one day before the flight) explaining the issue and asking for assistance, and ideally an acceptable solution, I could not believe the amount of balderdash that was uttered, even by airline standards! I was also offered the same upgrade for ... ¬£500. When declining, I was told that a ""note will be entered for check-in at the airport"". You would not be surprised if I told you that nothing of that ever materialised.",2019-11,2019-11-17,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0

In one word: Excellent!,San Jose,Paris,International,"We flew outbound from London Heathrow to San Jos√©, Costa Rica, with a change in Paris CDG. This was in Economy Class, and I'd say it was good - enjoyable food, comfortable seats, good in-flight entertainment, and very pleasant cabin crew (it's not often I can say this). For our return we checked in online, and upgraded to Premium Economy through a special offer during the check-in process. When we arrived at the airport in San Jos√©, they asked if we'd like to upgrade again to Business Class. I asked how much extra it would cost, and after a considerable time and calculations, they arrived at a price that was only $88 extra each. So of course I said yes.

This was the first time I'd travelled in Business Class long haul, so I have nothing really to compare it with, but let's just say it was amazing! For a start, the seat slides down and joins with the foot-well to make a full-length, completely flat bed, so I was able to sleep properly (I am never usually able to sleep on flights) during the 10-hour overnight flight. The ""bed"" was surprisingly comfortable, and you get a thin duvet-like blanket rather than the normal thin blankets in economy, so I was nice and warm. Aside from the seat/bed, the area around you is cosy with plenty of places to put things, and you get a nice big entertainment screen. The in-flight entertainment programme is the same throughout the plane, but the bigger screen and full headphones just made it better.

The food was thoughtfully prepared and presented, and was quite delicious. It was also nice to be served with a linen serviette, large tray, proper ceramic plates/dishes and metal cutlery. It was also nice to have a welcome glass of champagne.

So yes it was thoroughly enjoyable, definitely worth the extra money, and I hope I can go Busines Class again soon. More to the point, I really enjoyed flying with Air France. Even in Economy class, the cabin crew were very pleasant and seemed genuinely caring. I can spot a fake smile a mile away, but the flight attendants that served me (both male - one in Economy on the way out and one in Business on the way back) had genuine smiles. More than anything, that has stayed with me since the flights.

I will definitely try to fly with Air France again, and I will definitely recommend them to family and friends.",2019-10,2019-11-15,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

We had very little time, we both ran - my husband has sciatica and I have asthma.  While waiting to board, my husband's leg gave out and he fell down.  There were no seats where they had herded us. The Air France employee just stood there and looked at him until other passengers yelled at him to get a chair or something - and that took him several minutes.

No prior notice on this changr whatsoever. Plane change is the airline's decision and customers who have paid extra money beforehand should surely have priority on these seats. I don't care if the flight is full which is the excuse that they have said in not being able to do anything. It's poor administration from the airline and this burden should not be laid on the customers.

Service and crew attitude was poor at best.,Budapest,Paris,Europe,It's only a two and a half flight but the crew was not attentive. A quick drink and small snack was served about 30 minutes into the flight. Trash was not picked up until 30 minutes prior to landing. We didn't expect any food service beyond what we received but the crew gathered in the rear of the plane for almost the entire flight and did not pay any attention to us passengers. We don't require much attention. However the crew should have made some effort to walk through to check on people.,2019-11,2019-11-11,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

Premium Economy is a joke. Fly Delta,Atlanta,Paris,International,Delta didn‚Äôt have a premium economy class when I booked. So paid more for Premium Economy on Air France. Seat was very uncomfortable for a long haul flight and none of the seats recline (what?).  Food ways like a TV dinner.  Alcohol was easy to come by thankfully.

Awesome service on board; incredibly friendly flight attendants,Paris,San Jose,International,"Despite the 10+ hour long flight, I can sincerely say that due to the friendliness and lovely attention of the flight attendants, I did not feel the fatigue one would normally associate with these journeys.

The boarding was orderly and the food far more than adequate.

It's okay to travel,Paris,Atlanta,International,"The seats were okay, the food was okay with the exception of what i think was scrambled eggs? The movie selection is good, but my Aux output from my monitor was terrible! I couldn't move to much or touch the cable or else it would pop out, all the movies i had to hear it with the background noise louder than the voices of people speaking... I even tried my own headsets and same thing; terrible way to watch a movie. And I had to sit next a guy that was partially on my seat, so the whole 10 hours I had to sit a bit sideways to not bump shoulders or fight for the arm rest! What a horrible way to sit and travel... and I paid for a whole seat? And this guy paid as much as i did to have a seat and 1/4 of another seat? Fat people need to lose weight or sit in first class!

Very Nice Airline,Budapest,Houston,International,I had never flown Air France before.  I flew on 11/5 from Budapest to Paris and then had a connection from Paris to Houston.  The larger plane flown from Paris to Houston was very nice and well maintained.  Th seats were comfortable even in Economy.  The food service was quite nice.  I wish I had been offered beverages more often.  The restrooms became very dirty (all surfaces were wet) and required cleaning.  The crew did not regularly check the restrooms.  The smell wafted into the cabin and was unpleasant. Aside from the restrooms not being cleaned often enough it was a nice more importantly uneventful safe flight.,2019-11,2019-11-09,4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0

A Very Comfortable 380 to Los Angeles,Paris,Los Angeles,International,"I wrote another review about Air France on their Seattle/Paris route. This trip was much more comfortable, with excellent service and staff and with comfortable seating. From the moment I boarded in Paris the crew was friendly and helpful. Boarding was super efficient and it was easy to get settled in. On the 380, the upper deck is almost all Business Class with a small Economy cabin in the back. While Air France is in the process of re-furbishing their fleet, the 380 is not currently scheduled for this. I was not sure of what to expect with the cabin. While the seating is a 2-2-2 configuration the seats themselves are quite comfortable and there is sufficient storage along with easily accessible outlets. The entertainment screen is large and is touch sensitive making it easy to use. The seat itself has several different settings making it very comfotable for this long, daytime flight. Unlike the new cabins, these seats do not have privacy from your neighbor, but that doesn't really bother as it does some. 

The crew were very helpful throughout the flight. The meal service was excellent and the food served was surprisingly good, especially when compared to my flight over. Throughout the flight, the FAs were available and there was an excellent snack and beverage bar set up in the galley. Overall, an excellent flight. I just wish the service on Air France was more consistent throughout it's routes, especially on long haul.",2019-10,2019-11-08,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0
Very Disappointed,Seattle,Paris,International,"I have flown AF in the past in business and have had a great experience. This flight is one of the worst flights I have been on in a very long time, certainly the worst I've had in international business. The day started with a notice that my afternoon flight to Paris had been cancelled. While frustrating, it has never happened to me so I didn't get worked up about it, I just started the process of re-routing. As I was on the phone with Delta, (the codeshare I booked with), I got a second email that the flight had been delayed by 4 hours. Needless to say I was relieved.

The plane was re-scheduled from an afternoon departure to around 6:00 PM. From the moment I was on board the crew seemed almost grumpy. Perhaps they were tired, perhaps they were frustrated by the delay but honestly, each one of the attendants I encountered seemed to be robotically going through the motions. In fact beyond the initial dinner service, The attendants remained in the galley until the meal before landing. 

The plane itself was an extrememly tired looking A-330. Air France is in the process of re-furbishing their planes and this one clearly hasn't had the upgrade. The seats were angled, not lie flat, the entertainment screen was easily 10 years old, small and difficult to work, and overall the the seating area seemed worn and tired. I was able to get some sleep, but not much. 

And the food was terrible for both meals, just really terrible. I don't expect much regarding airplane food, but this was an all time low. 

The bottom line is that the Seattle/Paris trip on Air France left a lot to be desired. I traveled back through LAX on Air France and had a completely different and positive experience, which I'll write about in another review.",2019-10,2019-11-08,2.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,1.0

A spiral dive of quality,Lima,Paris,International,"Not long ago Air France could boast it was the only airline that offered champagne to all their customers - how times have changed... I travel a great deal and in the last few years have travelled on Air France to South Africa, the US, Brazil, Canada, Chad, Kenya & Congo-Brazzaville and have witnessed first hand their total collapse in quality. In the same time-span I've also travelled long-haul on Qatar, Emirates, Ethiad, Turkish, Kenyan, Ethiopian, Air Madagascar, Air Mauritius, Brussels, Swiss and KLM. Of this list only Air Madagascar offers a worse service. It may come a surprise that African carriers (eg Ethiopian/Kenyan) are now head and shoulders superior in both service and aircraft than this flagging Flag carrier. On our recent AF flights to and from Lima, Peru the flight was absolutely packed (so they are doing something right) - on the return flight the in-seat entertainment system was truly vintage - tiny screen with functionality so clunky that virtually nobody in the packed cabin preserved in using it. Meals are awful - breakfast comprised of not one but two cold rolls and an undercooked cheese pastry (the pastry was raw). My wife asked for ice with her warm white wine at dinner to which the air-stewardess said she must be German (she is Irish) and to never, ever ask for this in France! A bottle of alcoholic punch of unknown origin is found on every dinner tray - including those of my three children, showing absolutely no care or attention to detail. The cheese at dinner was a processed offering from Austria - one would think that Air France might be able to stretch to a French cheese? The only thing French appears to be the haughty service which really is not in keeping with the quality of food and drink provided. The pension hole liabilities amongst the European flag carriers is well known and cost-cutting may well be required in order for their long term survival may be necessary - but to completely remove any style of flair can not be the way to go - I for one will now actively avoid flying Air France (and their stablemate KLM) if at all possible in the future.",2019-11,2019-11-06,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0
Trouble from beginning,Atlanta,Kinshasa,International,"Air France changed by itinerary noon the day before my flight... sending me to another country and arriving to my destination a day late without asking.  I managed to change it back through the help of Delta Airlines.  The reason was given that one leg beginning in Atlanta to Paris was delayed and I would not make my connection in Paris.  Not true!  They should have given me the option of what I wanted to do.  On top of that they lost 2 bags filled with supplies for Congo Orphans that finally arrive two days before my return flight.  Trying to find Air France in Kinshasa was a nightmare!  By phone they could not tell me how to get there!  3 hours later and the one and only Air France employee who can release your luggage (even though 4 others were in office) had to come and find me on the street and take me to office.  No signs anywhere on building, in building or the 13th floor where office was located.  It would have been impossible for someone to find.  Received my two bags, no apology given, but then she assumed I would give her money for my own bags.  What a joke!  Complaining got me know where when I emailed Air France??  Losers in all this were the orphans.

additionally, I had the drunk lady hanging all over my aisle seat as she kept coming to talk to the passenger in the seat directly in front of me. I actually had to push her off of me when she leaned into his seat.

I have travelled business class all over the world and this was far the worst, in fact it really wasn‚Äôt business class but premium economy with a seat which we‚Äôll sort of lies down.

The flight attendants basically refused to speak English to me , I very kindly moved out of my window seat to accommodate another French customer so they could sit next to there friend  to a seat that had no storage, no foot stool for landing and taking off , the smallest television ever ( I think the TV in economy were bigger ) , I was been knocked and banged by the stewardess when they basically refused to move the trolley so had to go into your seat space to pass and then the one time I needed some water to take a pain killer I pushed the button and nobody came so I had to go and get a bottle of water myself. I think Air France need to go and have lessons in Business class service as the stewardess are terrible, there isn‚Äôt one thing I could say that‚Äôs good, and to top it off my suitcase was completely and utterly wrecked and I am still waiting for a reply back from there so called customer service department, I have family members travelling economy with extra leg room ( which you pay ¬£66.00) who have sent me a picture showing there seats which are exactly the same as all the other economy seats, no extra leg room at all so again I have been conned",2019-10,2019-11-02,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

Very nice experience in Business Class,Los Angeles,Paris,International,"We recently flew Air France business class to Paris on the 777 and had great flights.  The flight attendants were nice, although service was somewhat spotty depending on who you had serving you.  (For example, my companion was sitting on the other aisle (3F while I was in 3E) and he got a hot towel and very attentive flight attendants who kept asking him if he needed things, whereas on my side of the aisle, no towels and no asking about anything.  I didn't want to cause a ruckus so I got up to get stuff myself and would often find the flight attendants chatting amongst themselves when I asked if I could have more water, wine, bread, or the silverware I had accidentally not been given. Really not a big deal (first world problem!) but noticeable lack of attention to detail.) [Note: We have flown to Japan multiple times in ANA first class so unfortunately for AF, that is the baseline that I use for comparison].  That said, the food was delicious and plentiful, the wine and digestifs were great, and if somehow you were still hungry, there was a buffet cart with crackers, chips, fresh fruit, and yogurt you could always access.
The lounge at LAX was shared with Qantas and was beautiful and clean, with a nice selection of food.  The CDG lounge in terminal 2E was the antithesis of LAX; it was so crowded that it was hard to find a seat, the food that was present had either run out or looked unappetizing, and the entire lounge was not clean.  The bathrooms were definitely lacking in cleanliness.  I was pretty disappointed that an Air France lounge in CDG could be so lackluster and unappealing, but at least we had the flight to look forward to.
All in all, we will definitely fly Air France Business Class on the 777 on our next trip to France.  Tip: In October, my parents flew the A380 from LAX to CDG and the 777 back.  They said the 777 was superior and disliked just about everything about the A380  (especially the uncomfortable seats that did not lie flat and made you feel like you were sliding down towards the floor).  On the 777 return trip, they mentioned to the flight attendant how much better the 777 is, and she said that even the flight attendants don't like the A380 business class because it is so outdated.",2019-10,2019-11-01,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

Whether it be the namesake airline or their smaller Blue subsidiary, they have remained consistently exceptional. Seating accommodations, in-flight entertainment, meals; all well beyond what we‚Äôve come to expect from U.S. based airlines. There is simply no comparison. The cabin crews have remained charming and patient, even the ticketing personnel puts their American counterparts to shame. Hate to sound like a Globalist, but better is better.

Decent standard and courteous service,Singapore,Paris,International,"Unlike many, I haven‚Äôt had much negatives about Air France throughout the years I‚Äôve flown with them. On top, many passengers find Charles de Gaulle airport confusing and uninspiring. I would argue that the signage at the airport is quite clear, and a pure Air France flight transit here can be done in less than one hour between the carrier‚Äôs terminals. I like AF‚Äôs Premium economy, as the seats are wide, very comfy, ample of leg space, and the back of the seat is fixed, thus no irritating reclining of the seat in front of you. You recline yourself inside the seat when you want to sleep. Also, you are provided a generous blanket, in my opinion. Finally, Premium Economy has its own private cabin with just 24 seats, making it a peaceful area of the aircraft just behind Business Class. As Premium Economy passenger, you are a SkyPriority passenger, giving you separate dedicated check-in counters and the fast track lanes at Charles de Gaulle airport for both passport and security check - so relieving! 

Onboard, at departure, you receive an amenity kit with most basics. The food is decent. What separates the dinner meal from an Economy meal is the menu‚Äôs starter and desert. But the main course is the same. And so is the entire breakfast, if you‚Äôre on an overnight flight. Wide touch screens, wide foldable table trays, and courteous French service. Our flight took 13-14 hours. In between the meals, there is an Air France bar in both middle and back galley that serves snacks and dinner at help-yourself. On our return flight, we travelled Economy, and if you‚Äôre a couple, definitely worth to pay the extra amount for a two seater. Study the aircraft cabin layout. On the 777, there‚Äôs about 10 x 2 seaters, and I highly recommend, as the general seat configuration in Economy of 3-4-3 is very crammed and almost an awful experience to endure on a 10+ hour flight. A unique feature on the way back was, 2 hours before arrival, we heard birds chirping coming our of the main cabin loud speakers.

flight however was totally different - great crew - very attentive - lovely comfortable seats - good entertainment system - supposed to be free wifi (for texts) but i couldnt get it to work - i did not ask for assistance as i didnt really need it so maybe crew could have fixed.

However, the crew kept on offering a variety of stuffs from Indian series as also from the west. We enjoyed the food very much as also the trip.

Just Another Money-Grubbing Airline Now,Los Angeles,Paris,International,"We were planning five nights in Paris in early October and did our research on airlines.  We had a number of choices for non-stops.  But we went with Air France and paid a higher fare because we thought it would be less of a ""cattle car"" experience. We were so wrong. I was sitting on the aisle in the middle section. But the cabin had been stuffed with so many seats that the aisle was extremely narrow.  And that resulted in my being bumped numerous times particularly by the flight attendants who were about as unpleasant a crew as I have encountered in an international flight.  And when the guy in front of me put his seat back, it literally knocked the plastic glass off my tray. The sad fact is that Air France (whom I've flown for years) is now just ordinary which means, in terms of today's standards, pretty terrible.  I wished we had flown Air Norwegian for $200 less -- it certainly wouldn't have been any less awful a flight.",2019-10,2019-10-27,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

Bad surprise in business class: buy an AF ticket and get a low flight cost instead...,Mumbai,Paris,International,"I was returning from Mumbai after a long business trip in Asia and was expecting a good night sleep (take off at 1:55 am local time) in one of these flat beds you get on AF business class, with the privacy that their cosy corner set up provides. Unfortunately, instead of the regular AF plane, I got an old A340 that was branded Joon, i.e. the now defunct low cost company of the AF group. The business class arrangement was definitely low cost, with seats that offer no privacy and don't even get fully flat, not enough legroom and no space to leave your stuff (like the secs I wear). 
It is really disappointing to pay full fare business and get a low cost service instead.
But the bad news is that it might happen again as these planes are not to be retired and AF does not intend to rearrange them to their usual standards. apparently they will even get brand new A350 in this inferior set up. Which means buying an AF business ticket is now a lottery: will you get the real business class service, or the low cost one? 
Conclusion: don't fly Air France in business. You may end up getting their Joon low cost service...",2019-10,2019-10-27,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

The flights were on time.  No delays.  The connections went well.  The service on the planes was good.  We had a meal with wine included.  One problem is that the space is tight.  It is probably the same on other companies.  I recommend it but please note that they lost my daughter in law's luggage.  She obtained her luggage only on Day 5 of our cruise.  This needs to be addressed by the company.  It is a subcontractor taking care of those types of problems and they don't seem to check the cruise ship schedule in order to deliver a lost bag.

On the outbound flight there were a group of visually imparied travellers and one was struggling to get down the aisle - the female steward who was hiding in the gallery laughing at the lady didnt do a lot to help until she saw me looking at her - disgraceful. also on the Paris Amman leg it was a small aircraft with ordinary seats with little recline. No on board wifi or entertainment! After paying over ¬£1000 for business class which I checked on the Air France website this was a hugh shock to me. As it was a late night flight I would at least have expected a decent recline on the seat. Myself and another passenger complained to the head steward who insisted no one complained about their service. On the return leg, a 1.40 am departure from Jordan, was awful. The crew keep walking in and out of the galley kicking my feet on the way and continually let the galley lights reflect into the main cabin. I had a blanket over my head the whole way but the kicking of my feet by crew stopped sleep happening. Food was pretty woeful too. All in all will never travel with Air France EVER again.

"Uncaring, unsympathetic, non-flexible",Munich,New York City,International,"The unfortunate hospitalization of my daughter while in Europe required me to make an immediate flight reservation to fly from JFK to Munich. I also needed to upgrade her ticket by hospital order that she must lie down due to a significant concussion. The tickets were initially handled by Delta, but everything else was Air France. 
I was able to upgrade her after 2 hours on the phone, and had to take whatever ticket was available for me at short notice, that ended up being premium economy. We were told to speak with Air France in Munich upon our return to hopefully have me closer to her, as I need to check on her while flying. We are now sitting at Munich airport completely disgusted with their lack of caring or flexibility. At check in we asked to change my ticket and were told that we could not. The ticket they booked for me apparently could not be changed - a direct contradiction to what I was told in the phone. I was willing to pay for an upgrade, but was told that I could not, I would have to purchase a brand new ticket and lose all the money payed for the old one. Are you kidding me?!?! I am traveling because of a family medical injury/ hospitalization and the fact that Air France is so rigid and inflexible is unacceptable. Additionally, my daughters ticket allowed her to visit the lounge, and although I had premium and alerted the airline to our issue, they would not let me go in with her. We are now together (of course) at the gate, and my daughter is laying on the dirty floor with head and neck pain. We haven‚Äôt even gotten on the flight yet and the stress is sky high. It is UNBELIEVABLE that no one could make the changes necessary happen. 
On a side note, I suffer from celiac disease and no where on check in is there a computerized option to chose a safe meal. The number Delta provides rings endlessly, and I could not get through. My assumption is that even if I did get a person on the phone, they would have told me I needed to contact Air France (a useless option)
Air France shame on you!
You‚Äôre inflexible and uncaring. In the future we will make a point to avoid your airline and advise others to do the same

HK-PARIS-AMSTERDAM (Vegetarian Hindu Meal),Hong Kong,Amsterdam,International,"Flew with Air France from Hong Kong, being a vegetarian (no meat or seafood) i read a lot of forums before booking the right in-flight meal because often it is mistaken that vegetarians eat seafood. Therefore, I selected 'Vegetarian Hindu Meal' which included Black Lentil, Bell pepper with rice. Will not rate it tasty but it was just OK. For breakfast there was Corn with White Channa and beneath was a thin layer of 3-4 Bhatura's, the taste was definitely good but Bhatura's were soggy, wouldn't have been if they were served separately. But i guess booking the meal in advance saved me from being hungry as there are limited options left, if you are a vegetarian. 
I had a connecting flight from Hong Kong to Paris and Paris to Amsterdam. In flight from Paris everyone was served croissant with coffee. Croissant was very cold, felt it would have been nice they could have served it warm and yes, you just get one, there is no replenishment",2019-10,2019-10-22,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0

Upon checking in we did not notice that we had to pay extra for this suitcase. They charged us double the price we should of payed on line.

New Airfrance business is very nice,Bangkok,Paris,International,"I flew a few times before on europe to asia flights with Airfrance in business class and the seat used to be really bad (large seat but not reclinable to flat bed) compared to other airlines. In the meantime Airfrance changed business class seats to upgrade to a flat bed seat like Cathay Pacific for example, so in my flight this month I experienced new seats: they are as good as other airline now and fully reclinable to flat bed so this is great! Regarding service, food and drinks, Airfrance used to be great but they also improved from my point of view. I can say the food and drinks are really amazing now and much better than any other airline! Cathay food in business is so so but with AirFrance, it is really great!!!! Fresh and delicious food, wine is really nice (white was sancerre and red was Saint Julien - Fiefs de Lagrange 2012). I really had the best inflight experience ever. Nothing negative to say, congratulations AirFrance, you really corrected all bad things! Cabin crew is attentive and remembers what you chose and is proposing extra things (like espresso).
Inflight video is great too, reactive, big HD screen, good selection and good noise cancellation headset!

Pleasant flight,Abuja,New York City,International,The first leg of the trip (Abuja-Paris) was quite smooth. So was the second leg from Paris to New York. In both cases there were a few minor cases of turbulence but the pilots handled the situation competently. There's nothing as reassuring as when a pilot communicates well with passengers on how the trip is going. Air France pilots do that well. The only underside is that I wish their menu had more variety.

The flight was good however the toilet in the front of business class was not working both going and coming, so not plan to fix the toilet anytime soon it would appear ( Yes it was the same plane ) Entertainment aboard is not as good as other airlines, for me not too many new releases worth watching and the general collection needs updating.

Do not fly with Air France!!!!!!!,Lima,Gothenburg,International,"Rude and insincere behaviour from staff! Checked in online the 18th of october and choose seats for both flights with Air France (Lima-Paris, Paris-Gothenburg). The flight to Paris the next day was delayed so we had to run to the transit gate and were at the gate during expected boarding. We were relieved to see that the plane to Gothenburg was delayed so we could relax. 40 minutes after the plane was supposed to leave (but boarding had not even started) we recieved a message that our tickets had been cancelled and were rebooked for a flight the next day (involving of course an inconvinient transit)! The staff told us they had made the decision to give up our seats for sale when they saw that the flight from Lima was delayed?? I highly suspect overbooking and them not being sincere about it (the same staff knew the flight to Gothenburg was severly delayed and the message of our cancellation and rebooking occured 50 minutes after we arrived at the gate). Turns out the was seats available to the same destination a few hours later and the inconvinient flight the next day was absolutely not the only option, apperently if you stand your ground and are a bit of a pain in the ass, you will get better treatment! I would not recommend Air France, previous flight history includes lost  and ruined baggage! Would suggest Turkish airlines or KLM when possible!",2019-10,2019-10-20,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

Air France: Safe but Bland,Amsterdam,Paris,Europe,"Founded in 1933, Air France is the flag carrier of, well, France. With a fleet size of 224 aircraft, the airline services approximately 200 destinations in 78 countries. Over the years, Air France has developed something of a reputation for being stylish and refined just like its home country.

While I‚Äôm sure the ‚Äústylish‚Äù reputation is merited for premium and business classes, my experience in lowly economy was fairly standard; that is to say, the seats were narrow and cramped aboard our A320-200. There‚Äôs a reason why ‚Äúeconomy‚Äù in the modern day has colloquially been referred to as cattle-class. It‚Äôs just not that comfortable. Additionally, the cabin crew were cordial, but hardly what I‚Äôd call friendly. In many ways, they reminded me of Air Canada‚Äôs flight crews: Cold, almost robotic. There was one bright spot in our flight from AMS to CDG, though. Even though the total flight time was barely over an hour and fifteen minutes, we were served a decent snack ‚Äì a pesto sandwich with beverage. It might not be much, but it‚Äôs still lightyears better than what you get on Canadian carriers during ‚Äúshort‚Äù flights (i.e.: less than 2 hours), which is a whole lot of nothing . . . unless you pay.

All in all, as a seasoned traveler, I‚Äôd rate Air France a solid 3-stars for my experience in economy class. The airline has a decent safety record; the aircraft are well maintained and clean; and the staff are cordial, though maybe a little too much like automatons. While I was disappointed that the originally scheduled A318 was replaced by the A320, it was still nice to fly on this national carrier for the first time and, once at CDG, to see one of their (retired) Concorde (F-BVFF) on display.",2018-11,2019-10-20,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0

Anyway the boarding process was chaotic. The plane was old and there was no in- flight entertainment and the food was awful. I also think that the sanitary conditions were poor. The day after when I landed in NYC, I had E.coli. I did drink tea on the plane and I know that is chancy.

Great Flights / Great Service,Washington DC,Paris,International,"My wife and I flew Air France, business class round trip, from Dulles to Paris. We actually spent time in London too as part of our vacation and would have otherwise flown to London first but we changed our schedule to avoid Virgin Atlantic's tight sardine -- like compartments / seating configurations in their business class. Air France provides superior service. Our flight to Paris left at around 9:00 pm but the business lounge served the exact meal we would have had on the plane enabling us to eat early and sleep on the flight. The cabin and the seats were comfortable with a wide selection of music and movies. The flight back from Paris to Dulles was equally satisfying. The flight stewards were very attentive, the meal, including the cheese selection and the wines were all top notch. Time flew and we both agreed that the flight back was probably the best flight we ever flew on.",2019-09,2019-10-18,5.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

Okay Flight with Air France,Freetown,Paris,International,"Flying economy with Air France is equivalent to flying economy on overseas flights with Delta or American Airlines - decent plane, not enough seat space, and adequate food. On this flight the plane was over an hour late arriving in Freetown. Once we boarded and departed, the first leg (to Conakry, Guinea) was about 30 minutes long. Not unsurprisingly, we did not see the flight attendants during it. In Conakry we changed crews and most of the passengers. We were still behind schedule when we left, although the Captain promised us that we would arrive at Charles De Gaulle Airport at the originally scheduled time. 

The plane, a Boeing 787, was in decent condition. It was clean and each seat had a pillow, blanket and headphone set. My main problem with the plane is the seat configuration in economy. It  was cramped. I had an aisle seat and was constantly bumped by crew and passengers going up and down the aisle. The only way to avoid being bumped was to not use the armrest. I had paid extra for my seat in order to have additional legroom, which was a blessing. I only wish the seat had been wider. I am not unusually large and I still felt cramped in it. 

The meal choices were pasta or chicken. I chose the pasta. It was edible and not over cooked. Once the meal was finished, additional service was extremely limited. I realize that I was on an overnight flight and many passengers were sleeping. I did not sleep that much. It would have been nice to see the flight attendants passing through the cabin periodically checking to see if I wanted anything to drink. 

The entertainment options were adequate. I watched three movies during the flight. Sound was not a problem because I bring my own headphones. The nine inch screen is large enough to view the material.

About an hour before we landed a very light Continental Breakfast was served. It consisted of a croissant and choice of beverage. I chose a chocolate one with coffee. I rate the croissant as okay. It was edible. I wish that it had been warmed just a little. I also wish that I had been offered a refill for my coffee. 

We landed at Charles de Gaulle about 10 minutes behind schedule, which was okay for me since I had three hours to make my next flight and my luggage was checked through to my destination. 

As I said in the title of this review, the flight was okay. It was not great or fantastic. I only wish it had been. I will probably fly Air France again because it is one of the few options that I have when I travel to many locations in Africa.",2019-10,2019-10-18,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0

It was the last  flight with Air France company for me and my family,Vancouver,Paris,International,"It was the last time when I chose Air France to travel. 25 minutes delay in Paris, after they live Vancouver with 15 minutes delay, the passengers waiting in the bus on the runaway, more than 15 minutes for cleaning the airplane, that was not so fine, arriving in Paris with 25 minutes delay, almost to miss the connected flight to Bucharest, with very rude officers at the control point, with a huge row of travelers,  with no transfer for our luggage to Bucharest flight, thing that I could understand for the delay, BUT with a lot of stuff missing from our luggage when they finally arrive home (after 1 day and a half). The final balance for our damage: a newly bought suitcase damaged and missing stuff about 2000 euros including clothing, footwear, sunglasses, wine, sweets, and many other things. We made the complain at the airport in Bucharest, the AF registered our complaints and after 2 weeks already, we don't have an answer till now. You have to be attentive at the food that the airplane provides because one of us (we were 4 on that flight) had serious injuries for the stomach and gall. It was awfull. We had former flights with Air France a couple of years ago, but at this moment the company is on the ''free fall''.

Excellent in many respects,Hong Kong,Newcastle upon Tyne,International,"Had booked via a travel agent (won't ever be doing that again), and due to problems with the travel agent had quite a few telephone conversations with different Air France/KLM staff, all of whom were fantastic. Flight from HK to Paris was in smaller front part of the Business Class cabin, which felt very cosy. Started by showering in lounge at Hong Kong airport (having gotten their on 11-hour flight from Auckland). The shower facilities are excellent, but the food and drink on offer in the Business Class lounge (one shared with other airlines) was only just OK, especially given how much Business Class tickets cost. The level of service on the flight was nothing particularly special compared to Economy, but several of the flight attendants (who were mostly older females) were genuinely friendly and engaging in conversations in a way I had not encountered before. On our return flight the attendants were almost all younger males, and they were less friendly though still fine. Some of the food was outstanding, as even was the espresso coffee (never experienced that on a plane before). The seats are slightly old, but very comfortable both when sitting and lying flat; very easy to adjust into a good position. The video entertainment was also no better than in Economy, and indeed I was very surprised that there were no news channels at all. The supplied blanket was thin, and the cabin temperature was rather variable. The only real ""problem"" with the Business Class seats is that they include a personal reading light that can be shone almost directly into other passengers; these should be redesigned. The ""Business Class"" leg from Paris to Newcastle was simply in the front few standard seats of 3x3 seats, with no extra overhead luggage allowance. So be warned if you take two carry-on bags, as you are allowed to on Air France. In the return leg from Newcastle to Paris, everyone on the plane had to deposit their carry-on bags on a trolley before entering the plane, which worked well to avoid a squash in the plane itself. I definitely hope to be able to fly Business Class with Air France in one of their lie-flat seats again.",2019-08,2019-10-17,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0

GO GET YOUR BABY'S BELT!,Boston,Paris,International,"I've been traveling with Airfrance for years and I am always impressed of their customer service from check-in to picking up the baggage. I wanted to share my experience with everyone specifically with the flight crew. 

I traveled with my 18 months baby. They assigned me great seat and I was first to be called to board. As soon as I get in the plane a crew member named ""Said"" greeted me with smile and brought the belt for the baby. 

So far so good. I was happy with my seat, my baggage, boarding... After everyone settle in their seats. ""Said"" told me that there is an empty row with 3 seats, and I can move to for extra comfort. That was great gesture from him, and I moved to it.

After I moved I realized that the other flight attendant is rude and seem to be a little angry. When taking back the my lunch tray, she noticed that my daughter vomit a bit, and she went ""Eww"" she makes me and my daughter feel terrible.

When the plane started landing, she asked me where is the belt for the baby. I told her that I was in different seat and I moved, she goes where? what seat number? I was very surprised of her response. She went look and she came back saying ""Can you go get the BELT?"" I was shocked and not expecting this non-professional respond again.

How is she expecting a passenger with  a baby to go get the belt and carry the baby while the plane started landing? isn't this insane? Some other passengers by my side said "" OH GOSH! that was rude. If she was in American airline, she would be fired with that behavior"".

I am so thankful that ""Said"" was there for me and cover up for her, otherwise, it would been worst.",2019-10,2019-10-17,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Air France disappointing flight experience,Cairo,Seattle,International,"Me and my son recently visited Cairo and took Air France flights back. Besides a 4 hour delay on the first flight and a one hour delay on the second one, one of our two suitcases made it back after two days and the other one has not been found yet (1 week). 
Despite numerous phone calls describing the item and the inventory, the baggage tracker still shows the wrong description and no updates have been provided. 
The airline even closed the claim, and I had to call again to let them know that our bag has not been returned. Very messy customer service.

The flight from hell,Venice,Seattle,International,"Both legs of this flight were total disasters.  Requested wheelchair assistance didn‚Äôt show up.  Checking into Venice, staff could not print a boarding pass for one person in our party.  We had been notified earlier our connecting flight had been changed giving us 1 hour at Charles De Galle to make our connection.  Our seat selections did not follow the change.  
We learned the hard way Charles DeGalle typically unloads on the tarmac and you take a bus to the terminal.
Out ticket showed gate 33 for our connecting flight.  Struggling with mobility I was slow in arriving at 33 only to learn the gate had been changed to gate 48.  An elevator to the tarmac, a bus ride to the jumbo jet and a huge staircase to climb up to the plane.
Once inside this very old air bus I get seated to learn the electronics in the seat in front of me don‚Äôt work.  During the flight the passenger in front of me reclined the entire 9 hours putting her seat 12 inches from my chest.  My traveling companion and I were separated, she was put in Priority and I was placed in 34F.
One hour into the flight we are served chicken nuggets in a fruit sauce a 2‚Äù square of polenta and a single 1‚Äù bud of broccoli blackened from the heating.  That‚Äôs it folks.  For those wanting more than the mini ice cream bar we were told the next 8 hours were serve yourself to juice and cookies in the back of the plane.
We did get a surprise when 1 hour prior to landing they served us a flour tortilla filled with melted cheese.  All the food offered was inferior.
Liquors. Were not available.  I asked for Perrier water but it too was not available.
I am new in the travel business but an experienced traveler.  I am highly reluctant to send clients to this Airline.  On top of all this KLM lost our luggage for 3 days flying into Rome.

Even if theres people missing the flight, they won't inform through loud speakers the peoples names.
Theres crazy amount of security checks and check ins that are operated poorly by people who don't know how to speak english.
The bus drivers are just smoking cigarettes and looking around taking their time instead of focusing on the job.
Aircrafts themselves are very dirty, don't even consider opening your food tray.
The whole layout and design of the airport is very unorganized and signs of gates, terminals etc. aren't properly shown and may hide behind walls or other large objects or around the corners. Specially T2 Gate 58 which you get into by going downstairs that looks like it would be a staff area.

If you‚Äôre flying with sport equipment or children and need special luggage requirements (like a stroller etc), be warned in advance that you will get very little help and your luggage will probably be tossed around like it‚Äôs in a cocktail shaker. 

No help is offered, staff behave as though you‚Äôre interrupting them when you politely request any help or to ask a question etc. This is both on ground crew as well as cabin crew. No one seems happy to be at work in the Air France family.

AF premium Economy getting worse,Washington DC,Athens,International,"When Air Francs stopped referring to their premium economy as Voyager class - that might have signaled the decline of that class of travel.   We‚Äôve taken PE on AF and other airlines and always found Air France best in the  past.  The minuses are adding up - is it only on the Airbus or all flights ? 
The seats seem less comfortable- are they shorter? Or just the configuration?  They slide down instead of recline - but only a tiny bit ‚Äî so ones head is at a weird angle and ones back curled ( very bad for ones‚Äôs back) . Air France used to have relatively good food- and PE was a treat . However, on this last flight it was the usual inedible airline fare ( one option was bow tie noodles with a thin topping of breadcrumbs and grated cheese . Is this a kids meal?) . Voyager class used to board with business, had its own toilets and real silverware.  This time, we  boarded with economy class,  shared one toilet with all of economy (!) , and plastic ware . This last item is not that important- but just another sign Premium Economy on Air France is now closer to economy and less like Business.  I do have to note - business doesn‚Äôt look as good as it used to either. 
I‚Äôve flown business once on Air France and noticed the seats and surrounding equipment now seem less comfortable and impressive than before.

Better Than Flying Domestic,San Francisco,Paris,International,"Premium economy seating on Air France gives you a separate space with custom seats and lighting.

Disappointing,Montreal,Antananarivo,International,"I used to look forward to flying on foreign airlines on international flights because flying on domestic airlines had become a disappointing and uncomfortable ordeal. If Air France is any indication, the decline in comfort and service has metastasized beyond the U.S. borders and infected the international fleet. The seats were only acceptable if your shoulders, and those of the passengers next to you, are no broader than your hips. The headphone jacks were faulty on all of the four flights I took on this trip, so that in the event I found something of interest in the entertainment selection, I was required to continually juggle a poorly fitting plug to get any sound. Given the culinary reputation of the French, I was hoping for a better meal than I would expect these days from our domestic carriers, but the food was mediocre at best, and poor much of the time.

Meal service lacking,Paris,Vancouver,International,"We fly Air France every year from Vancouver to Paris and return. The first year that started flying out of YVR, the onboard meal service in Prem Econ was fabulous--frequent meal service and great food. But this year when we flew in Prem Econ again from YVR to CDG to YVR....both flights were lacking in meal service.

The flight attendants were friendly enough but do not expect the meal service to be any different in Prem Econ than regular Econ. If you are looking for extra meal service and much better meals, then it has to be in Business cabin.

On our flight 379 from CDG to YVR this year in September, 2019, the food was ghastly.  I had the honey chicken with rice which was almost inedible. 
Throughout the 10 hour flight, there was only little snack given....ice cream bar. 
Service was not attentive at all.

For the price we pay in prem econ with AF, we may start looking at Transat and other airlines as we were not pleased with AF this year.

I started filming as I thought his actions were inappropriate and were to make us late, and they started yelling at me in french, grabbed my phone, and deleted the video.  It wasn't until the airline manager from Norwegian showed up that the search went fast enough for other airport standards.  There are also no signs, there was no sign showing where our airline gate was to check baggage.  We had to ask about five people to find out where Norwegian was located.  This is not the case in any other airport I have been to, including the rural Philippines.  And, there was a guy from our airline, Norwegian, who had no identification, no ID, no badge nothing!  When I asked him if he was with Norwegian, I asked for an ID (he had a bottle of something in his pocket), he could not produce one.   Finally, there is no way to take a wheelchair in the airport, the escalators are all slanted.  My mom is disabled and this is a problem, almost made for anyone but the old or disabled.

Terrific flight,Washington DC,Bordeaux,International,"The staff of the airlines could not have been more helpful.  They were very pleasant and were available for the passengers needs.  We were fed decently, and being a French airline, the wine was a great bonus.  We flew to Bordeaux France from Washington Dulles via Charles de Gaulle in Paris.

I have a hate hate relationship with Dulles.  It is NOT passenger friendly.  But the staff there were great.  My wife has mobility issues and needs a wheelchair to successfully navigate airports.  Herein the issue.  These services are offered by the airport, not the airline.  When we arrived in France, there were no people to take my wife.  She, among others (including a 92 year old WW II veteran) had to walk great distances.  That is not right.

I mentioned this to an Air France staffer when we started our return trip home.  I asked if it were an issue of the airline or the airport.  As stated, the airport blew it on the inbound flight.  The staff was there on the return flight, but they didn't take their charges seriously.  There was great chit chat between the airport porters taking folks to and from planes.  Though I can't speak French well, I can understand it and much of the conversation was inappropriate and they did not get folks to their planes in a timely manner.

That being said, the flights were good.  You can't blame the airline for turbulence and bad weather.  They needed to take a longer way around a storm in the Boston area on the return trip.  They could have been better about notifying the passengers about this.

We paid for the upgraded seats in premium economy.  Much nicer than steerage.  We did not have to present a doctor's letter as we did for other airlines.

CDG to LAX - Long Time in a Plane,Paris,Los Angeles,International,"Boarding started and then stopped - we all stood around in lines, never told what the delay was.  Plane is a Boeing 777-300, good aircraft nice interior.  In flight service was a little uneven.  Had trouble with the audio system, took over an hour to get it fixed (replaced).  Crew was nice and attentive. Food and beverage service was very good. The overall space was fine, but the way the seat makes into a bed is a little cramped if you have long legs.  Not as comfortable as other similar service on other airlines.  
The biggest negative is the airport - CDG is very large and spread out and seems you have always go thru extra security and walk a long ways between connecting flights.

Air France disappoints ... again,Paris,Washington DC,International,"After Air France lost our checked luggage a few years ago, we bought size compliant roll-aboard cases in order to avoid checking bags.  This works fine on transAtlantic United and Lufthansa.  And it worked fine on our way from IAD to CDG on Air France.

The roll aboard cases fit in the overhead bins, the bins close easily and our backpacks slide under our seats.

As we made our way through security at CDG on our way home, we were sent to the side to weigh our combined carry-on bags.  Turns out Air France has a rule that carry-on luggage must not only be size compliant, it must also weigh less than 12 kg (in Coach Class).  We were each about 5 kg overweight.  So - we were sent to another line at luggage check-in and we paid 50 Euro each to check our roll-aboard cases.

This is a complete shakedown.  The cases fit on the plane.  The ‚Äúrule‚Äù is not uniformly enforced.  There are scores of passengers on the plane who weigh dozens of kg more than I do (so this can‚Äôt be an overall weight issue).  And to top it all off, Air France managed to lose my friend‚Äôs roll-aboard on this non-stop flight.

The worse airline I have ever flown on!  In every way!,Milan,Marseille,Europe,"Let me start out by saying I will never fly Air France or Delta airline again....hands down the worst air travel experience I have had in my 70 years.   And to top it off the worst customer service I have ever received from any airline dealing with both Air France and Delta.

We planned a great vacation, a trip of a lifetime, with amazing travel and vacation spots.  One region we had wanted to spend 3 days in was the South of France.  Prior to that we were in Lake Como and then Milan.  Trouble all started with Air France in Milan when we boarded our flight to fly to Marseille, but we had to connect through Paris CDG.  Mind you we were at the airport 2 hours prior to our flight.  Everything with Air France seemed dysfunctional, from checking the bags to the weird lines at CDG, where it just looked like a mob of people.  We finally arrived in Marseille but with no bags it turned out.  Not one or two bags but all 4 bags, everything we needed for a 4 week vacation were missing..  We travel to Europe for 4 weeks every year.  Never had bags lost, but that was not the worst of it.  The person at the airport in Marseille, was rude and not helpful at all.  When I complained about the bad customer service, she said, and I quote‚Ä¶‚ÄùYes, Air France has terrible customer service‚Äù‚Ä¶well, she was living proof of that.   It gets even worse because so many calls were made and no one would tell us where the bags were or when they would arrive.  We had to sit in the room and wait because we had rented an apartment and there was no one to leave the bags with if they were delivered.  We finally got 2 of the bags mid day on the 2nd day.  We were told that the delivery company would call and tell us with a time‚Ä¶they never did, they just showed up and called from downstairs.  Finally we were told that another bag was coming in that night, so we went to the airport and retrieved one bag ourselves, although we were told not to by the representative of Air France.  The final bag showed up on the 3rd day as we were leaving.  Again by a delivery person who just showed up with no phone call.   By this time we had totally wasted the 3 days we had for the South of France, and now headed to the train station to head North to Reims.  Wasted money flying there, wasted money staying in an apartment, wasted money for a rental car which the only time we used was to go back to the airport to retrieve 1 bag.  There were more than 30 calls made to track our bags over the 3 wasted days.   And the biggest problem was that my heart and blood pressure medication was in the bags,  and this was told to the representative a number of times, yet nothing was rushed and no one even seemed to care.   In my many trips to France, I had never experienced the rude people that I have always heard about until now, until my dealing with Air France.
Once back in the US, I sent a message and was contacted by Delta, with what I,  and anyone else who experienced what we experienced, considered a rude and insulting offer.  I wrote some many letters to the heads at Air France, including their CEO Anne Rigail, and many of the corp officers as well as at Delta.  NOT 1 single person ever contacted me...Whatever you do...book with anyone else other than Air France...you will regret flying as we did.",2019-05,2019-10-05,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,3.0

First Fly from cph to tls it was something very weird and humidity we left the baby pram before we bord the plane and I ask the person there do we claim the baby pram in tls or cdg because our final destination was cdg Paris the answer was ask the stewardess. Why can't give a proper answer to me.

2 We did bord the plane and just before take off I was moved from my seat to another for 10 minutes reasons pregnant women can't seat that chear it need my seat I don't know how it will prevent or helps her but I had it to move away from my kids for take off like I was the only one in the plane nice excuse.
Just humiliatiat us on the plane I ask a glass of wother it toke 15 minutes to bring it to me maybe they fax it from the graund nice.
So finally we have landed and I ask the stewardess where can i claim the baby pram now in tls or in cdg I get a response just go to league sorter and pick it up so we went down. after a long search we couldn't find it so we hade ask the information and finally we have learned that we will claim it in cdg Paris supernice.

3after a long wait we have learnd from an other company that our plain is delaying 50 minutes is so hard for af people to give a proper information and respect to us who's paying their salaries
Shame on them.

4 On the way back we been pointed in the wrong direction twice and we almost missed the plain and not enough they took our hand luggages before we bord the plain but why the stewardess was pretending that can't speek English but I wandering why took our hand luggage why not take it when we left the baby pram at the check-in bord
Nothing is missing so far.

I just like to bring it to your attention this is my last flight whit airfrance.

Extremely happy to have booked our trip to Paris from Washington DC!!!,Washington DC,Paris,International,"We took a non stop flight to France overnight. We left around 6pm DC time and landed around 6 am pues time. At first we booked the cheapest flight because we wanted to spend that extra money out there instead. Once we were closer to the date, we looked again and decided that the upgrade available online was so worth it, it included unlimited drinks and best of all, a lot more leg room which I‚Äôm not that tall (5 10) but my husband is taller (6 3). It was the best deduction we made. The flight was so comfortable first of all, we were next the exit doors so that extra room was perfect for our legs. It also included a welcome glass of champagne and unlimited wine or liquor which helped me take my sleeping pills after dinner. I slept so good and woke up full of energy and didn‚Äôt waste the day in Paris, once we got there we started our sightseeing and didn‚Äôt waste any time taking naps or sleeping. We did the same thing on our flight back. The crew was so nice both ways. They were so friendly and attentive and very sociable. Will definitely do Air France soon again!!! #ThanksAirFrance!",2019-05,2019-10-03,5.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
Flights were ok and transit in CDG is always nice,Cairo,Newcastle upon Tyne,International,"I had a 4- hour transit in CDG which was fun with the selection of shops. The first flight from Cairo was ok- I had crepe for breakfast. I wasn‚Äôt crazy about the Juhayna juice and strawberry yogurt- I think healthier alternatives should be offered. I had to skip everything in breakfast but the crepe which was nice.

On the second flight, we were offered a lemon cake or some salt crackers plus tea or coffee. It was an ok flight as well.",2019-10,2019-10-03,4.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
Disappointed,Boston,Vienna,International,"I have been flying to Europe 2-3 times per year for the past 21 years, on all airlines including AF, and I know a thing or two about what to expect. On my recent flight to Austria with AF via Paris CDG (outbound code share with Delta, returning on AF, connections with Austrian), too many things went wrong to not write a review.

First, avoid CDG for connections. Their shuttle system between terminals is slow and easily overwhelmed. If you don't have at least two hours to spare, forget about making it. I had a really hard time both ways, outbound because I was unfamiliar with the system, returning because 500 Americans from 3 different flights all wanted to get on that same bus to make their connection.

Second, the service on the AF flight from Paris to Boston was inferior, compared to the competition. No Scotch (!, or any other liquor, for that matter), no beverage service between meals, not even a cup of water from a tray. I was dehydrated on my window seat. Staff not exactly friendly when you ask for something. 

And lastly, while I made it to Vienna, my bag did not. Yes, in 2019, this can happen. My itinerary continued from Vienna to Greece, booked separately, for a vacation on a yacht. I had to have my bag sent back home (it made it there before me) and was forced to buy everything again that I needed for the vacation. Luckily I had a 4 hour layover in Vienna to get this done.

I can say that this was the worst of my 50 or so trips over the past 20 years and I don't see myself flying AF again if I can help it.",2019-09,2019-10-03,2.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
Exceeded Expectations,Los Angeles,Paris,International,"This Delta/Air France code share left from LAX‚Äôs international terminal, which was difficult to access because of very intrusive ongoing construction. (The VIP lounge was closed; the AA/BA lounge was a substitute.) The plane, a smallish 777 with an ancient layout, wasn‚Äôt particularly comfortable, but the service was terrific - and the food and beverage choices were excellent. Very tasty.

Dreadful Flight,Paris,Amman,International,"Without competition on this route, perhaps Air France believes it doesn‚Äôt need to even try. ‚ÄúFirst Class‚Äù was dreadful; hard to imagine how bad Coach was. FC featured coach seats (cramped), coach legroom (none), zero amenities (no entertainment systems, no power ports, minimal refreshments). The only distinction in FC was the middle seats in the 6-across layout weren‚Äôt assigned. This was a 5+ hour flight. The maintenance of the plane seemed very unsatisfactory. The best I can say is that the plane seemed airworthy.",2019-10,2019-10-03,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
Lost baggage followed by rude staff comments,Paris,Frankfurt,Europe,"My plane was delayed by about 30 minutes with no explanation or apology, but luckily this wasn't such a big deal for me. The worst part was that my luggage was delayed and didn't get on my plane despite a 3 hours stopover in Paris. I understand this happens of course, and I wasn't upset about it. However, I was told I would get my delayed baggage delivered to me the next day. I tracked it online and the luggage was delivered to my home airport, but then I got no new information. The day after it was supposed to arrive I called Air France's lost/delayed baggage phone number, and was told that they can't tell me anything or help me. I called once again later in the day to ask if they could possibly call the baggage delivery people for an estimated time (I was having to stay home for work to wait for luggage they kept saying would arrive...), and the agent talking to me raised her voice as if speaking to a child and said, ""You called earlier and were told your luggage is on a delivery truck, so don't call again."" I wasn't told that, but also this was a really rude response to a calm and polite question. It was also evidently a lie because I'm currently still waiting for my luggage to arrive 4 days later and have no information or help on how long this will take or if I will get to see my bag again. This is the worst customer service I've ever had from an airline, and I've lost luggage before which was swiftly and professionally returned. Really, really disappointed and can't recommend Air France to anyone unfortunately.",2019-09,2019-10-03,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.1219191587249426,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0819906910132473

Surprisingly (given that we were flying with Air France), the food was mediocre (not bad but very average).  We've flown Air France a couple of times in the past and the food was very good by airline food standards.  Our sense is that this is true for flights that originate in Europe.

The representative did nothing, I asked her again and the AF female French employee just ignored the question with a huff and walked away. The French flight attendants in the Premium Economy section were also poor with customer service.

Lost reserved seats,Dallas,Paris,International,"I booked my premium economy tickets in April of this year and selected seats for both the flight to Paris and the flight back home. We are a family of five with kids aged 9, 12, 14. I reserved seats so we can all sit close together and I can keep an eye on my kids. You read too many stories of creeps striking up inappropriate conversations with kids on planes...

Come check-in time, we have been reassigned to other (still premium economy) seats. We are split up in groups of 2-2-1, my 12 year old sitting by himself next to a stranger.

We also lost our reserved seats for the flight back and will get seats assigned at check-in. Needless to say, I find this unacceptable behavior, especially after paying for the premium tickets.

In the end, the gate agent in DFW corrected the seat assignment for the outbound journey so that my 12 year old did not have to sit alone. On the way back, we were unable to check in online the evening before and did not have assigned seats, which caused quite a bit of stress. When we came to the airport, we found we'd all been upgraded to Business Class. That was nice, but our family was still spread out over the business class cabin. It took a three-way seat swap to get my two older kids to sit together. The upgrade is the only reason I award 3 stars instead on 1 star. The airline caused a lot of unnecessary stress during the time up to the flights.

Also, while checking in, I noticed they had all our birthdays off by one day. When I tried to update my frequent flyer program, the whole site crashed and was down for 10 minutes or so.",2019-07,2019-10-01,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,5.0

Unless the flight is free...don't do it!  Call +33 9 69 39 36 54 when they lose YOUR bags,Athens,Detroit,International,"I was talked into Air France for a trip to Greece this year.  Had flown Lufthansa in the past.

At every step of the trip, it was apparent to me that these people are incompetent.  The online check in barely works at all and takes forever; the boarding process is moronic (groups, having nothing to do with where you are sitting); the food was awful.  And that airport in Paris, Charles de Gaulle, is a complete joke.  Ohare wannabe!

But the worst part was then they lost the luggage for all 3 people in our party on the  return flight...then the fun REALLY began.

Landing in Detroit, we spent the better part of an hour with a Delta (alliance) baggage claim person.  The problem was - none of these people knew how to work the Air France system.  Oh, and they wanted to know if it was all right ""to leave the bags at the front door of the house.""  LOLOL  sure...anything to make THEIR lives easier.

The next morning, I began receiving emails from Air France, telling me that my lost bags were ""on their way to Paris.""  Isn't that lovely, as we live in Detroit!  And the file numbers we were given did not match anything in the Air France system online.  Additionally, the Air France system provided no telephone numbers whatsoever, and relied completely on Delta for baggage claim issues.  Super!

Two of the bags showed up the following night, after midnight, at our home.  The third is still lost in space as of this writing.

Let me give you all the telephone numbers that we finally were able to google - might help some of you: _+33 9 69 39 36 54

CSR @ Air France,Minneapolis,Bucharest,International,"Air France has always been my company of choice when flying internationally.  I've never had a problem on any of my previous flights with them. Customer Services reps at the call center were extremely understanding polite and professional with knowledge. 

Air France allowed me each time i booked with them to modify my non refundable ticket within the 24 hour policy or cancel. The reps do not act like the reps from Blue Air Romania does. Blue Air Romania you need to model after Air France and follow your policies, and stop treating US Citizens poorly.

First and last time,Paris,Los Angeles,International,"Always thinking Air France is the best and happy to fly Air France this time. I was not feeling well due to the weather changed. During the flight I‚Äôd asked for a cracker and water to take medicine (7am). The flight attendant said: NO, WILL SERVE FOOD in 20‚Äô. But they didn‚Äôt until more than an hour later. I was hungry and thirsty. Before that I‚Äôve asked for a hot chocolate, the flight attendant just looked at me and didn‚Äôt say anything, I‚Äôve waited but she never came back. When they served food for the second time, I‚Äôve asked again for a hot chocolate, another one told me they don‚Äôt have it. But it was printed on the economy menu. During more than 10 hours non stop flight, there were 2 small meals and 1 snack. By the way, the tv screen was not working at all and the one on my husband‚Äôs side is not high tech.

A Good Experience,Paris,Los Angeles,International,"Our round-trip on Air France was pretty seamless. Premium Economy was definitely worth the upgrade cost -- and one person I talked to on the same flight said he called a week or so before the flight and got the upgrade at a reduced rate, but that's subject to availability.
Not everybody we know has had an experience as good as ours, but ups and downs seem to be common with most airline experiences. One bad or good experience doesn't guarantee that it will be that way for everyone. 
No need to bring food; we had three meals, and for airline food, better than average by quite a bit. A good selection of movies helped pass the time. Flight attendants were helpful and readily available.

Two flights ago, security took my walking stick (necessary for me) because Air France did not check it instead. Cost me a lot of grief, months to get it back, and $150 shipping. (sentimental value).

This time, they could not transfer my points (for 10 days) and repeatedly cancelled my reservations because Air France‚Äôs site would not transfer the points because of a computer problem with AmEx.

Perfect Flight,Paris,Atlanta,International,"This was my first flight with Air France.   We found a discounted business class flight, or series of flights, from Charlotte to Venice, with Delta.  The return leg from Paris to Atlanta turned out to be operated by Air France, on one of their Boeing 777's.  When I first saw the Business Class accomodations I was a bit disappointed, as the seats offered less privacy and did not initially appear to be as nice as Delta's 767 or Lufthansa's A330.  However, the seats turned out to be my favorite.  I am 6'3"" and usually can't really stretch out in the reclining seats on the other planes, but the 777 had a truly lie-flat seat and enough leg room and foot room not be crowded.

The entertainment system was first rate, with dozens of movie and TV choices, as well as music and continuous flight info and progress.

But the piece de resistance was the food.  Air France served what was the absolute best airplane food I have ever experienced.  The main meal was fine restaurant quality and the lesser meal nearly as good.

All in all, this was an exceptional flight in my experience.  I hope all Air France Business Class flights live up to that standard.",2019-09,2019-09-23,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

You have to understand the La Premiere lounge: most things are not out for display. However if you ask the accommodating staff, anything will quickly be provided to you. I did not enjoy the Alain Ducasse menu in the lounge as I chose to eat on the plane (Michelin quality food in flight), but I enjoyed a lovely Burgundy wine and an excellent massage.

Worst flight of my life,Paris,Newcastle upon Tyne,Europe,"Everything seemed alright with boarding etc. We boarded a bus to get us to the plane but that bus never actually moved. Stuck in a bus for 30 minutes when the driver anounces that the bus had to go for some reason and we had to move to the one behind since it was available. About 1 hour and 30 minutes later the flight eventually takes off. Arriving in NCL my buggage did not arrive. I went through the proper process and I totally understand that delayed baggage is something that happens and it is completely understundable and thus my bad review is not for that but rather the fact that for five days I had to call Airfrance 24/7 to track my bag, eventually even though I was informed by airfrance that my bag was with the courier, it never was. Bag arrived 5 days later. On top of that I did some nessecity purchases which I as every other passenger like me are entitled to up to 100 euros for them purchases. Submitted a claim and did not het any answer for 6 days now. All in all while it is an okay company in regards of flying, when things go wrong there is no customer support or any kind of willingness to help their customers.",2019-09,2019-09-17,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

Of course the French wine and Champagne was magnificent.  But the service after the service was lacking...I had to fend for myself and seek water and additional wine or drinks every time I wanted something.  Did AA and BA spoil me with attentive service, you be the judge.

Need Costumer Service Training,Paris,Madrid,Europe,"Last Sept. 8 after we spent a few days in Paris, we had to return to Madrid. We  bought these round tickets at least 5 months in advance. Air France for some reason lost my name in their list, but my wife's name was duplicated. Although they had previously taken us to Paris they didn't give any explanation about my booking.
One of the women in the Ticketing Office  at the airport, never listened what I had to say, although I was calm. She was rude and threatened me that I had to buy another ticket. After several 90 minutes and running from place to place, they fixed the problem in their system, and we almost lost the flight and the connections to USA. 
They never apologized, or at least showed some courtesy.
I understand that there are at least two golden rules when you have to deal with costumers, one is lessening, and other is to be courteous, we had none.  This was our wedding anniversary trip, and these people gave us a very bad experience. They need take some costumer service training, we do not pay for such kind of experiences.

They bumped us off our flight twice! I had to spend hours on the phone straightening it out.,Seattle,Rome,International,"I booked our flights to Rome for my family of 4 plus my elderly mother, 6 months in advance and paid extra to reserve all our seats. The flight was operated by Delta but was an Air France flight. A few weeks before our flight, I received an email stating there was minor change in our flight. On further investigating, I found that we were no longer booked on a flight home. I called Delta and they said the flight was changed to being operated by Air France. They changed the flight numbers and did not move us to our new flight, they just dropped us. I called Air France and they told me I had to call our cruise line who we bought the tickets through. We called them and they said they had nothing to do with it and I needed to call Air France again. I then called Delta and asked them to sort it out since they were the airline I had booked with originally, and they helped me get back on the flight, but it took many hours of phone calls and holds to get it fixed. after all of this, our seats (that we had paid Delta for) were gone.  Air France said they had no record I paid so they refused to reassign my seats. I then went through Delta and again after a couple hours of hold times and calls it got fixed. The next week, the whole episode of losing our flights and seats happened again! I had to go through the whole thing with both airlines again. This also took hours. I estimated after the whole thing that I spent 15-16 hours on the phone and hold times. The flights themselves were just mediocre. Very little leg room. Less than usual. Terrible food. No one in our family ate any of it. The long flights only had drink service at the very beginning and very end with 6-7 hours of no service in between even though they were not redeyes. My light didn't work in my seat so I couldn't read my book.

Business Class... Great Experience,Chicago,Paris,International,"Due to company policy, I don't get to fly Air France too often (too expensive), but in this case I was able to.  My past experiences with Air France have been very good, and this was another trip where they didn't let me down.  This was actually a Delta flight operated by Air France.  

The bad... the lounge at Terminal 5 in Chicago is really not very good.  It's used by many airlines, and truly, there really isn't enough room for the people that are using it.  No bathrooms inside of the lounge so if you want to use one, you are leaving the lounge.  They aren't far, but if you're travelling alone, it could mean packing up your stuff just for a quick trip to the WC.  The food offerings were limited at best... two hot dishes, some sandwiches, chips, and fruits... not much more.  Beverages were decent with a good offering of wines, sodas, beer, and spirits (with some mixers as well).  Overall, it's clearly not on par with other lounges.  But, that's just getting to the airport... 

On board, the staff was very helpful.  The plane was an Airbus A330, with the newer business class accommodations.  Very comfortable, with lay-flat seats.  The media screen was nice and large, and the media selection was very nice.  The headphones were decent as well.

Dinner was fantastic as has always been on Air France.  I had the rack of lamb.  Fresh food, with several dishes to choose from, a nice cheese plate, and several varieties of desserts.  The wine list was small, but decent as well.

The bathroom was roomy in business class, but my seat was fairly close to it, and if the door wasn't completely shut, then you could hear the sucking sound from the sink - not awesome, but the crew was aware of this and helped to try and keep the door shut.  

Flight time was about 7.5 hours - about 30 minutes faster than what I normally experience on the way to Paris from Chicago.

Getting through Charles de Gualle airport is pretty painless... navigating through boarder control, getting bags, and passing through customs was quick (about 20 minutes) and painless.  

If you have the opportunity don't hesitate to take Air France out of Chicago, just don't expect a great experience if you have to use the lounge in Chicago... it was truly the downside of the whole flight experience.",2019-09,2019-09-10,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0

EXTREMELY cold plane and HORRIBLE food!,Los Angeles,Papeete,International,"We boarded our flight with a great deal of excitement as we were headed to Tahiti to celebrate our 20th Anniversary. We got to our seats & put our luggage in the overhead bins & took our seats. Once we got airborne we realized just how cold it was on board EVERYONE was complaining about the frigid temperature on the aircraft. The flight attendants were freely handing out the wafer thin rough blankets, which were no match for the cold. Being on an ice cold plane was not the best way to start a trip to a tropical destination. Once the aircraft was at a cruising altitude they came around with what looked like small gift bags, the bag contained a HALF of a COLD hard sandwich a mini bottle of yogurt & a mini brownie. Certainly this could not be what was considered dinner, this must‚Äôve been a very poor attempt at a ‚Äúwelcome on board‚Äù snack! We were so wrong, it was our DINNER! Cold food aboard Air France must be the norm, as our breakfast was cold as well! No one wants cold eggs & sausage. You would think being able to have a cocktail would‚Äôve been some sort of a redemption for Air France, it was not as the liquor on board was off brand as best, needless to say we did not partake in that option. With the exception of a glass of wine, we both had with our ice cold, rock hard, half of sandwich. In conclusion, we will avoid Air France in the future. The only good thing about our flight was getting to Tahiti safely. There was also one very nice flight attendant.

Unfortunately, our checked luggage did not make the flight from CDG to MSP and it has been 2 days without it. Fortunately, MSP was our home destination so it was a moderate inconvenience.

Air France scores very low on customer service,Paris,Toronto,International,"My daughter and I flew from Malaga to Paris in June to connect to Toronto. Upon arrival in Paris, the connection information board showed the flight was on time so we headed for the gate. By the time we got to the gate the flight had been cancelled- no reason ever given. My complaint is not so much that the flight had been cancelled as that there were no Air France personnel  any where to be found. Several airport security guards sent us to a series of AirFrance customer service desks none of which had anyone on duty. It took us 3 hours to find any Air France person to help. When we got home  (on a  different airline ) we filed a complaint with the airline and the EU Passenger Rights department.  We had far more ""service"" after the complaint than we ever had while in CDG airport.

As great as economy can be,Orlando,Paris,International,"On previous trips to France, we flew with a different carrier and had a miserable experience with food, crew and comfort. The Air France crew was delightful, with one surly exception who treated passengers with the amount of courtesy she thought their ticket price deserved. That is the only reason for less than 5.

The other attendants in our section were courteous, friendly and professional. The seats are as comfortable as economy seats will ever be.

The food was well above average.

So disappointed,Chicago,Paris,International,"I hadn't flown AF in years and was so looking forward to this trip. I paid a lot for my ticket and expected to get good services in return. On my flight to Paris, I had a checked bag, a carry-on bag, and a personal item (small backpack with earbuds, gum, etc.) They did not weigh my carry-on or my personal item at O'Hare. On my return flight from Paris to Chicago, they weighed my carry-on bag, AND my personal item, and they even tried to include my medically-necessary device in the 12kg limit for carry-on items. Out of about 7 AF staff members I interacted with at CDG, I would classify one as kind, one as almost kind, and the rest of them as BLEEPING BLEEPS. Based on my experience at CDG, I will never fly AF again. IF you are flying AF, be aware that their limit of 25lbs (12kg) includes EVERYTHING you are carrying on to the plane.

The next complaint was that the climate control wasn't working and on this NEW Airbus, there were NO vents to point at yourself while waiting for the AC to start working. It started about 90 min after boarding. (It did work from the get-go on my return flight)

Another annoyance was that the WiFi didn't come on. EVER. During the entire flight. They advertised FREE WiFi, so getting no WiFi was irritating. (Again, this worked on my return flight.)

Another nail in AF's coffin came in the form of some of the worst airline food I have ever experienced. Not even the bread was edible. Oh, AF how your standards have fallen.

Finally, in BOTH directions, the inflight map didn't work once we got over the Atlantic Ocean. On brand NEW airplanes. Not a major problem, but one more annoyance.

The one good thing I have to say is that the flight attendants were kind and helpful in both directions. Not enough to get me back, but the only thing that will get me on an AF flight ever again would be a FREE ticket.",2019-07,2019-09-09,2.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
We arrived safely and on time.  Meh.,Boston,Paris,International,"Absolutely average.

From a below average airport lounge to an elderly 777-200, although equipped with the new AF business class seats.

Seats are about the same as other BC seats are these days, as is the entertainment system.

Service on the way over was attentive (although I mostly wanted to sleep), the return cabin service completely indifferent.  On the 8 hour long inbound, I wasn't asked once if there was anything I might want.

So:  If all you you want transportation to get there that is reliable (on those times AF in not on some kind of a strike), AF will get you there.  If you think the flight should be part of the travel experience, the nest I can say is that it didn't suck.",2019-08,2019-09-09,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,3.0

Great Air Travel,Paris,San Francisco,International,"We flew Air France - NonStop-from San Francisco to Paris and then, after traveling for 3 weeks, took Air France from Paris back to SFO. This is an 11 hour flight, and Air France made the experience extremely pleasant. The flight attendants were incredibly friendly, efficient, and helpful. The food was delicious - and they served multiple snacks. They started off serving a glass of champagne to welcome passengers! There was a video screen at every seat and the airline offered a variety of movies, shows, and music - all for free. This really helped to pass the travel time. Wine and cognac were offered (and appreciated) - all complimentary.

I called the customer care and had a night mare. I had 4 different call and each time each representative gave me different information about the cancellation policy of AirFrance. I am pretty sure I will never ever book this flight again. Also; I was on student visa and they have no good deals for the student their intention is to just make money on your extra luggage.

Great value for comfort,Paris,Minneapolis,International,Recently flew from USA to France in Delta ticket but overseas flight was on an Air France plane.  I booked a premium economy seat and found (6‚Äô3‚Äù tall 220 lb) there to be ample leg room and food width.  These seats are almost the same as the delta domestic first class seats.  My flight was about 8 hours and comfort level was good.  The seats recline in such a way as to not violate the space behind them.  Access to the bathroom through the first class cabin or behind a few rows is good.  Food is ok but I have never had ravingly good food in any class of seat.  Cost was about $2000 or about $800 more than the economy seat.  But well worth the investment.  They also give you something approaching a real blanket and a real pillow.

"Poor service, very cramped",New York City,Paris,International,"Paid extra for upgraded seats; the upgrade was merely a seat closer to the front of the plane.

Space available in seat was worse than most domestic flights on which I have traveled and had very limited legroom.

Honeymoon - would NEVER recommend,Raleigh,Naples,International,"Would never recommend. Husband and I flew on our honeymoon, bags lost. Called multiple times and no one has any idea their location. Could be in RDU, Paris or Naples and could not give us any time line on when we can expect to receive them. We spent the first two days of our honeymoon shopping for clothing instead of enjoying ourselves. We have called MULTIPLE times and no agent can give us any inclination of when we can receive it. We also move locations starting tomorrow and are not hopefully we will receive our belongings.

Too plastic,Paris,Tokyo,International,"Sorry, but compared to Premium Class in other airlines, esp. Air NZ,  this one does not compare.

One of the best flight experience!,Paris,New York City,International,The nicest crew that accommodated every request with kindness. Clean airplane and restrooms.

Best long-haul airline with hub in Europe,Santiago,Paris,International,"I cannot give enough compliments to AirFrance. Especially my long-haul flights in Economy felt like an upgrade compared to other carriers.
Very tasty food as well as free champagne onboard. Good choice of entertainment, but the best: Seats (referring to the modern B777-aircrafts) that feel very comfortable and allow to sleep even if you don‚Äôt have a free seat next to you.
AirFrance is always my first choice when travelling long-haul and I‚Äòd be really happy to be onboard their aircrafts again in the near future.",2019-06,2019-09-03,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
Great Service,Paris,New York City,International,"I didn't fly with Air France for many years as I always fly with Delta. But this time the price was cheaper than Delta.
Despite we took off 1H30mn late, it was a pleasure to fly with Airbus 380. I was seat 92A upper deck. Very confortable seat with good space for legs. This time I didn't book an extra leg room seat.
The staff took good care of the passengers giving water while waiting.
In flight the food was really good which is very rare  especially in economy class. I am not easy with food so the flight attendant gave me a premium menu, extra cheese and bread. We also got small bottles of water. Special thanks to Alexandre who is very professional and very nice. He also helped a young mother with her baby. You could feel that this young guy cares about the passengers. 
The only bad thing 1 suitcase was missing and I got it delivered 3 days later. They couldn't locate where the suitcase was. I bought some basics and I emailed the receipts. 24h later I got an email from Air France saying that I ll receive a check in 2 weeks. All in all great trip and I will definitely fly again with Air France.",2019-08,2019-09-03,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0

Worst Airline in Europe and Horrendous customer service. Would give 0 if I could,Cincinnati,Manchester,International,"I flew from CVG to CDG with Delta, however, booked through Air France. My flight was delayed a couple of hours but the Delta staff were amazing and unbelievably helpful.

Coming into land at CDG I was alittle apprehensive about missing my connection to Manchester, I checked the Air France app and it was as though my connection had disappeared. Delta checked on board and said there was nothing about a connection on the system. When we were coming into land it had reappeared but instead of my original seat and take off time it had been changed to a later flight and no seat. It turned out it was the same flight, however, it too had been delayed a couple of hours. 

Once at CDG I went straight through security as I was told my flight was delayed till 1:30pm but I had to go to the desk to get a new seat as mine had been given to someone else. I thought I would head straight down to the gate before going to get a drink. it was currently only 9:30am, I got to the gate and was told my flight was no longer delayed and I had missed it. I went to the customer service desk and told them about my delayed flight along with a number of other passengers who were in the same position. 

I was given a new flight for 12:50pm, while I was at the desk I told the customer service assistant I was worried about my luggage as it was still tracking on the delta flight and hadn‚Äôt been removed. He said it was fine and would be on my flight at 12:50pm.

I sat at my gate waiting and as the gates were opening I asked the assistant if my luggage was on the flight as it was still tracking on the Delta plane. She went to check and said there was no luggage on the flight under my name but to check with the flight attendant  once on board. I asked on board and was told they would check, he came back to me telling me there was no luggage for me on this plane, however, proceeded to tell everyone around me how lucky they were to have their luggage on board while I was trying to ask him questions about finding my luggage. He just shrugged at me and walked off. 
The flight was delayed but not by much and we took off to Manchester we were, however, diverted to Birmingham airport to refuel this added on another hour to the journey. Once off the plane I went to the lost luggage department and filled out all the paperwork. I also emailed a Delta red coat as I wasn‚Äôt holding out much hope Air France were going to do anything, within a few minutes the Red Coat has replied and said he had made a call to aCDG red coat and he was looking for it. I got another email from him saying it was found. I had heard nothing from Air France or from the luggage handlers by this point. 

Once Air France the luggage time got back to me they said it would be at Manchester for 8:50am the next day. I heard nothing from them so gave them a call around 11am and they told me it didn‚Äôt actually make that flight and would hopefully be at Manchester for 1:30pm. I got an email saying it would be delivered to my house ASAP. I called Air France and told them the address and they confirmed it. At 12:40am I got a call from the delivery driver saying he was close by but had a different address it was 1:20am when he arrived at my house and so I just grabbed my luggage thanked him and went to back to bed. 

I went to do my washing and just looked at my cases. My big one was half open, had been smashed in places and was needing a bin, my blue one was better but it had rubber stuck to it and also had something spilt down it. No biggie a case can be repaired if everything inside is okay...... well my bag had watermarks, my dress was torn, my camera case was very dirty/ muddy and finally my poor shorts had been destroyed. 

I called Air France and submitted an online complaint with lots of photos, this was on the 1st August 2019. I did not hear back from them at all. I called and now have an additional ¬£36 charges on my phone bill and they just said someone will email you at some point. I sent them messages on twitter asking from them to reply and I sent a number of emails. I have no heard back at all.

To recap my experience: delayed flights should have landed at 10:45am in Manchester and didn‚Äôt get there till 4:40pm. They lost my luggage, they ruined my cases, they damaged my clothes and they did not respond and ignored my complaint.",2019-07,2019-09-03,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

Great experience!,Paris,Mexico City,International,"We had the chance to upgrade from Business to La Premiere, we went for it and it was totally worth it, especially on this 12 hour flight! Pick-up at the flight arriving in CDG by private car, driven to the La Premiere lounge and then directly to the airplane from CDG (A380), including personal pick-up at destination. The lounge experience was fantastic, food was like in a very good restaurant, all stress and worry free (quick security and formalities check with zero queues also at boarding). Even if the La Premiere suites in the plane are not the newest and are open suites it was totally private and calm (only 9 seats in La Premiere vs. 80 in Business on A380). Outstanding service on board, great vanity kit and pyjamas and perfect food, plus non-stop La Grande Dame 2006 Champagne if you are so inclined, after already having Pol Roger in the lounge.

So we had to go back, they tried to book us on a turkish airway flight, but there was only space for 1 person instead on 3. So they said no they will book us into a hotel then we fly the next day, but they quickly changed their minds(we believe because they did not want to spend money on hotel etc.). So they booked us back on our original flight but we lost our pre booked seats and sat in the worst seats ever. We had to run across Paris airport to make the next flight.

Missery and champagne,Washington DC,Paris,International,"My Direct flight with KLM was canceled and I got rebooked on the Air France to Paris. Then Paris-Amsterdam. 
I was able to upgrade to business class, since this Airbus 380 has plenty of business seats on the upper deck. Best move I made that day. Waiting to take off, the pilot asked if a doctor was on board. We returned to the gate, luggage had to be taken off. Two hour delay!
I was so happy to be able to walk around. But being at Dulles, no champagne was flowing. Food arrived late, the beef was tough, I could not eat it. The lobster appetizer was two bites, so we‚Äôre the deserts. 3 bites. Select the chicken!!! The champagne was very good and the cheese saved my day. 
I also ate my cheese sandwich, which I had brought with me. 
The staff was very friendly, but I was never able to work out the video system, they couldn‚Äôt either.
I had 45 minutes to make my next flight, luckily I hooked up with a couple with a wheelchair. Mine, which I ordered, was not there.

"A380 Upper deck, Mexico City - Paris",Mexico City,Paris,International,"I paid a little extra to book a ""preferred seat"" (90D), so I could have extra legroom, and in the beginning I found it excellent. Since this is an exit row for a huge airplane, there is plenty of space in front of you (the tray table is inside your amrest).

However, to my surprise, this seat does not have an USB power connection, even if it is more expensive than a normal Economy ""packed"" seat (which have the power outlet in the tv screen set). There might be technical reasons for this, but I find this unacceptable in 2019. An 11-hour flight is very suitable to use our own devices, but without AC power this becomes very annoying. The solution? Find an empty seat and leave your PC charging there hoping that nobody will touch it.

In my case however (and this is the reason for the 4 stars), I could move to two empty seats (92K and 92L), thanks to the suggestion from the crew (there were other people asking to be moved, but my gold card helped)
One tip: On the Upper Deck (Economy Class), the seat configuration is 2-4-2, with a lot of space between the window seat and the window itself. An ideal place to travel alone or in couple.",2019-08,2019-08-30,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0

Good Experience with Air France,San Francisco,Paris,International,"Flew Air France recently between (to and from) SFO and Paris.  Overall, it was a good experience, i.e. no complaints.  Decent in-flight meals, good and friendly service, comfortable seating, and lots of snacks available for such a long flight.  This was Economy Seating.
Our return flight was delayed for a couple of hours, but we were offered free snacks and water while we waited at the airport terminal.  I doubt very much United or American Airlines would have done that.  (By the way, Air France and Delta Airlines were in partnership).

Disregard for the customer - 24 hours of nightmare,Tel Aviv,New York City,International,"The flight to New York via Paris was scheduled to depart at 1:30am. Half an hour before I left home I received a message from the airline that the flight was delayed until 4:45am, but that I had to check-in the suitcases by midnight. Why can't the suitcases be delivered two hours before the flight? Why do I have to wait in the field for more than 5 hours?
I didn't get an answer at the airport. I also received a NIS 50 voucher for food purchases (which is nothing for airport prices).
We waited in the field which was empty of passengers (middle of the night...) and had mostly a lot of maintenance personnel. Felt so empty and cold (which is not really typical of Ben-Gurion airport).
When they had already checked in for the flight, it was after a delay of an hour and we were still on the sleeve for half an hour waiting for a sick passenger to arrive, not even bothering to apologize or explain what was happening and why is the delay. Just scandal!
Of course, the connection flight from Paris to New York also moved and instead of 2 hours of waiting we had 5 hours of waiting. An ongoing nightmare.
At the CDG airport, we didn't even get compensation for food and beverage.
We arrived to New York after 24 hours on the air and in airports. It was a whole day without sleep...

Lost baggage and delayed flights,Salt Lake City,Florence,Domestic,"The entire travel experience was a joke. It began with a 5 hour delay in the SLC air port due to mechanical issues on the flight. Because of the length of the delay I was going to miss my connecting flight in Paris and the representatives at the check in gate in SLC were unable to help me because we were not inflight yet. So then I spent approximately 2 hours on the phone with delta representatives trying to ensure that I could get another flight as soon as possible as to protect the rest of my itinerary. They put me on another connecting flight that was 3 hours latter but if I hurried I could still catch the train and buss that I needed to in Florence. When I arrived in Paris Air France took over the second half of my travel plans. They printed me a new ticket, pointed me in the right direction, and assured me that my baggage would be following me to Florence. So with the 3 hours I had in the airport I tried to figure out what I could do when I got to Florence. My train in Florence was scheduled to leave 40 minutes after my flight came in. So although it would have been tight, I could still make it then catch the last bus to get to my final destination. Just when I thought everything would work out I went to get my checked baggage and low and behold! It wasn't there. The poor thing had been let at the Paris airport and all I had was a backpack and 100 euros. The process of declaring my lost baggage took forever due to the line of individuals in front of me who had also lost their baggage. So I completely missed the train and bus and was stranded at the airport in the middle of the night. I'm a female under the age of 25. It's not that I'm convinced something bad is going to happen to me but I like to keep safe. I never put myself in situations where I am alone at night in an unfamiliar place. Not to mention the fact I don't even speak Italian or have any nearby friends I could call. So Im in an empty airport, no delta or Air France representatives anywhere, and I am trying to contact customer service to see I they could offer me a hotel and shuttle so I could stay the night at a safe place. Only problem is that my international plan makes charges by the minute with calls. So when I was on hold with the airline for about an hour, there was nothing I could do. So I gave in and searched out a taxi service that could take me to my final destination which came to well over $200 dollars of added expenses. Not to mention the dangerous and uncomfortable situation which was thrust upon me due to the inconsistencies within the airlines. I still haven't received my luggage and it could take up to 2 days before I get it. All I want to do is shower and put on clean cloths but all my crap was in my checked bag. Sorry for the rant but this situation sucks.",2019-08,2019-08-22,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0

Unaccompanied children flying with Air France,Toulouse,Edinburgh,Europe,"Our children flew two days ago from Toulouse to Edinburgh via Paris CDG as unaccompanied minors.  You pay extra for this service.  There were two major and very worrying errors by Air France.  1) They looked through all the paperwork in Toulouse at check-in, selected what they needed from the stack I'd brought with me.  Rejected the rest.  Several hours later I get a call from Paris where the kids had landed saying that one piece of paper was missing for the border police.  I'd had it with me at check in and they told me it wasn't needed.  The kids were stuck in Paris without that paper to get on the next international flight.  2). One week before the flight I phoned Air France to check that I had all the necessary paperwork and to ask whether they would have food provided (journey from 9am to 5.30pm , 2 flights, stopover in Paris for 3.5 hours over lunchtime), or whether I should send them with a packed lunch.  I was told that it was unnecessary to send a packed lunch; that all food would be provided for them.  I had nothing to worry about.  The children arrived in Edinburgh, were met by their granny, and the first thing they said was that they had had nothing to eat all day.  Nothing.  They had breakfasted at home at 5.30am.  Didn't want to eat at airport cos they were soon to be boarding.  Headed over to Air France at 9am......at nothing until at grannie's at 6.30pm.  The children are aged 8 and 10.

Worst customer support I have ever experienced,Prague,Santiago,International,"I have never written a negative review in my life, but the consistent, extremely bad service of this airline really needs to be known.

I live between Prague (CZ, Europe) and Santiago de Chile and so I fly long distance quite regularly. I had 6 flights with AirFrance in the past year, and 3 (!) of those had some serious issue:

First, some items got stolen from my checked luggage. It was a serious hassle to get the refund, and the whole process took over 6 months.

Second, my fight got cancelled a day before departure, and they were unable to tell me when a replacement flight would be scheduled. This was particularly unpleasant because I had a wedding to attend to, so delay on the departure kinda defeats the point of the entire flight.

Third, my checked luggage get left in Paris (my transfer destination). They gave me an allowance of 200 EUR to purchase replacement items as I wait for the luggage (it's not amazing to arrive during the winter without all your warm clothes...), but again, the whole process of getting the money back from them now is taking over 2 months, and the reason why they can't do it is because their system ""lost"" my attachments with proofs of purchase.

So, I strongly advise you to NOT use this airline. Their inflight service is about average, but as soon as anything goes wrong, things become a nightmare: the customer support is unhelpful and EXTREMELY slow, their online infrastructure is unreliable, the whole company seems a complete mess just barely holding it together.

On this last flight however, it was painfully obvious how the lack of communication between systems was causing both customers and staff. One particular staff was having to assign seats for over 20 people AT THE GATE. I was directed to stand in one place by one staff and snapped at by another. I don't blame them. However, I do not have desire to fly with any of these partners until they streamline their logistics between the companies better.

Worst Flight Ever,Paris,Miami,International,"This flight had the worst cabin crew I have even been subjected to.We were in the Premium Economy cabin so the seats cost a good amount of money and I am not a demanding passenger or anything just for some context. The list of horrible things is long but I will give you the low-lights. A male attendant purposely pushed the drink card into a female passenger that didnt move far enough down the aisle out of his way; two female attendants almost got into a physical altercation with my wife when she went to use the restroom; the premium economy cabin got uncomfortably hot because they had the curtains sealed up so long without coming by for any in flight service, the attendant only realized when I went to ask if anything can be done so she followed me back to our area and realized that it was very hot so she opened one set of curtains and came around offering cups of water; the service was almost non-existent, I saw the cabin crew heating up and eating more hot meals than we were served. Then when this ordeal was finally over as we were exiting the plane- my young child, wife then myself- an attendant puts his arm out in front of me after my wife(who had my passport)  and child have passed and wants me to wait 'two minutes' while business class exits. I waited a bit but decided I had enough, I removed his arm and told him that he was very rude the entire flight.
My wife is convinced, based on this experience and some similar experiences that our friends have had on Air France, is that they treat the Americans worse than other passengers.",2019-08,2019-08-21,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0
A Company of Frauds and Cheats,Moscow,Paris,Europe,"I have flown all over the world for 5 years and been on many low budget airlines so I was surprised by Air France and the company making every other seem like a dream in comparison.

Air France lost my luggage on this connecting flight. But not like an airline might usually lose luggage. No it wasn't left in Moscow and then conveniently placed on the next flight. It arrived in Paris and was scanned in THEN lost. 

So what do we do? Well first we went to the baggage counter after waiting impotently at the carousel. They told us it arrived. So we went back to the carousel. They told us it couldn't be there. So we went back to the claims office. Who said ""O dont worry its here for sure so you'll get it at some point"".

My partner wanted to go to Disneyland Paris so we purchased expensive tickets and the bullet train to get there hopefully for around noon. But no, we were kept in the airport for well over an hour and a half waiting in lines after a 36 hour trip from China. 

We had to buy new tickets for the train, we arrived around 3pm. They gave us a crappy toiletries bag with some essentials. My partner, in tears after losing a bag containing 2 months of stuff was heart broken and just wanted a fresh change of clothes and some toiletries. 

We went first to a Disney store just to get underwear. We then - seeing the untenable prices - travelled 3 metro stops away to where google said there were stores and bought clothes for a few days and some toiletries which in Paris costs an arm and a leg. 

The next day we called and the baggage was still missing but they lady assured us that the limit is actually 60 euros a day and that AF understood that lost baggage in Paris was different to say Poland where prices are lower. 

It took 3 days to receive my bag and 4 for hers. They didn't call to tell us, in fact hers arrived at midnight on the 3rd night and she spent the whole night awake worried because we left the next day. 

So, these things happen right? 

Fair enough, we went about claiming for the delay. About 350 euros in clothes and toiletries and the Disney tickets. However, after 6 weeks fo AF asking over and over for the receipts that I had already sent, and discussions with the staff over the phone and even eventually whatsapp I received and email that they would send along 137 euros. 

137 euros? From over 550? Even without the tickets that were wasted 387 euros spent and less than half back?

Air France are a disgusting company that don't deserve your time of day. The flights were cramped, their service poor and their valid compensation refusal outright despicable. 

I would't fly with Air France again if they paid me, which they obviously won't since they seem more intent on robbing good customers. I wonder what they would say if a passenger said they would pay 500 euros for a flight before asking for 400 back for no reason.

Air France,New York City,Marrakech,International,"This has been the most horrendous airline experience I have ever had and I fly at least 5 times per year. On our first flight to Paris we were denied an alcoholic beverage (although alcoholic beverages were included), and then were denied water when requested. We were then provided breakfast with yogurt in it that had gone bad. When checking into our second flight from Paris to Marrakech I was forced to check my carry on bag which cost 90 Euros, however when boarding my original flight on Air France from JFK I was not questioned regarding the weight of my carry on. When I brought this up with the Air France employee, he rudely commented that no one is forcing me to do anything, suggesting I should just leave my luggage in the airport?

flight from seoul to napoli,Seoul,Indianapolis,International,"I recently flew from Seoul to Napoli, Italy and back on an Air France code shared with Korean Air. This means that while the ticketing is conducted by Air France, the actual plane and service is Korean Air -at least between Seoul and Paris. From Paris I changed to an Air France plane to and back from Napoli. This is possible between the two airlines are they are part of SKY Team. I will not post the airfare but note that there are these ""finds"" where you can save a great deal of money as competition for business seats is high flying out of Seoul as Koreans prefer to fly their local carrier for many obvious reasons. The actual Air France flight from Paris to Napoli took under two hours and was quite pleasant. The business seats are not too different from the economy ones but placed in front with an empty seat placed between passengers. While it is a short flight some light food and beverages are served. The service is very professional and the food is also quite good. If anyone is considering this flight be warned that the plane arrives in Napoli at close to 11 p.m. That is why I chose Palazzo Salgar knowing that it would only be about 10 minutes to that hotel as I needed to take a train from Central Station the next day. I arranged for a driver to come from the hotel who was holding a card with my name. After such as long flight time (including stopover 15 hours), I would recommend other people do this especially if they have family.

However, having no alternative option, I purchased these tickets, trusting that the consolidated Air France tickets would ensure that short connecting transit times in CDG would allow us to make our connections, particularly as we had no check-in luggage.

Things worked out fine on the outbound leg, when we had 90 minutes to transit.  However, the return leg was a complete disaster.  WHY DO AIR FRANCE SCHEDULE CONNECTING FLIGHTS WITH A 50 MINUTE TRANSIT TIME, KNOWING THAT THIS IS INADEQUATE FOR CONNECTIONS IN CDG AIRPORT???

horrible  - with one exception,Zurich,Seoul,International,"we flew from zurich via roissy to seoul - or should we say tried to because as we arrived our plane has left due to late arrival...

this is understandable.

with us travelled at least 15 people from korea totaled 19 of whom I at least recognised 5 others from Business class.

that the plane left is not the biggest drama - even though with a little effort of the extremely unefficient unfriendly and  horrifying groundservice it would have been manageable to reach the plane.

at the gate noone - at the information stand noone, 2nd information stand noone - luckily I speak French grabbed a guy and followed by 15 Korean tourists my people and I made it to a transfer desk where Caroline the dragon sieges. After having been proposed to fly to Japan, which for Air France seems to be roughly the same thing than Korea (this changed some years ago), we were booked on an Asiana flight. story not ended here.

After having retrieved our luggage, with the first time being helped by people who genuinely care we took the train to terminal 1 to get rid of the suitcases again.
no counter - for efficiency reasons - it opens only three hours prior - ok 

checked again at air france counter everything seemed ok.

arriving at the boarding at Asiana we have been waited for - good looking, kind, friendly and fully incompetent we have been told that we won‚Äôt be on that flight as Air France and Asiana did not manage to order food ( which seems to be a legal thing) within 4 hours (sic!)

Rosine, the first human we met at Air France, and at the same time the first person who really cared about the once so proud and good reputation of this airline tried to do everything to get us on a flight. Tokyo, no option , via Beijing - not possible, via Amsterdam - we lose a night - via Rome- same.
finally via Istanbul with Turkish airlines.
She personally made it with us to the checkin to ensure we actually could have the flight (meal thing etc) as for the very short notice 1h prior it seemed short to be organized compared to Asiana before. However she got us there and we are extremely grateful for her help and the help of the wonderful lady at Turkish airlines. The flight to Istanbul was a dream excellent service, excellent setting and ambience - we just were grateful -Catering from Do&co is an absolute asset.

In Istanbul we enjoyed the brand-new airport, which effectively rocks and passed another 3 1/2 hours in an astonishing lounge setting - and shopped until the plane took of at 05.00 including some sleep and again excellent food and drinks - my breakfast was a Viennese Kaiserguglhupf and a turkish coffee - fresh at 4.00 - thanks Attila - what a surprise to a stranded Viennese.
The flight with Turkish Airlines was as the first one - perfect. So my review finishes here as we still are travelling and for the flight back - we still have to undergo the Air France service horror again - happy holidays.

We had the chance to be on business I wonder how they do with Eco passengers.

I professionally was flying around the globe for 5 years and had the joy to use several business classes of various airlines among which Air France.

DO NOT FLY WITH AIR FRANCE!!,Atlanta,Dubai,International,"My now husband and I  booked through Air France for our honeymoon to Dubai. We had a short layover in Paris (CDG) on the way to Dubai, upon deboarding the plane, I noticed that I left my headphones and its case on the plane. Being that our flight was delayed in Atlanta, we only had 30mins to board the plane heading to Dubai and I did not have time to go back and try to find them. I spoke with an Air France representative in the airport who suggested that I go online and file a claim. I filed a claim and to my surprise someone turned in my headphones. Air France sent me an email confirming that the aircraft I was on along with the dates and description of my headphones matched and told me I had until September 2, 2019 to claim them. They then gave me a reference number and charged me 12 Euros (in addition my bank also charged me an international fee for the transaction) for a finding fee and suggested that I use a preferred courier since I live in the USA.  

I worked with the suggested courier and filled out the proper paperwork to have my headphones mailed to me.  The courier arrived at the airport to retrieve my item and was told that the item was not mine and the reference number was no longer valid. I contacted Air France and filed a claim and they responded with ""Hello after checking the headphones was fillers and yours no."" I have no idea who ""fillers"" is and I want my property. Its been almost a month they have stopped responding to my emails, they did not refund me the ""finding fee.""  I went back online and filed another claim for the headphones and they were still listed in the Lost and Found. I just want my property that I know is mine. You would think after spending over $2,100 with them for 2 flights they could return my $200 headphones. I WILL NOT USE THIS COMPANY OR RECOMMEND ANYONE USE THIS COMPANY! I will post my complaint on EVERY social media page  they have until I get results. You will NOT keep my product and my money.",2019-06,2019-08-15,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
Horrible business class experience from Boston-Paris-Bangalore,Boston,Bengaluru,International,"1. Check-in at Boston Logan (experience at the ticket counter) - We checked in at Gate 26 (Air France using the Sky Priority line) at about 3:30 pm for our flight at 6:05 pm on July 26, 2019. Our check-in experience was simply horrible. The lady at the counter had no clue about documents needed for travel to India and kept insisting that we couldn't fly despite having a US passport and an 'Overseas citizen of India' card. She had to ask around several times and the guy in the adjacent counter kept agreeing with her. Finally, she called upon another lady who appeared knowledgeable who said that there was no problem and all of our travel documents were in place. Finally, she checked us in and didn't even bother to direct us to the business lounge or anything. To add to our grief and anxiety, she exhibited tons of bad attitude as though we were at fault. Why does Air France have such ignorant people at their ticketing counters? If I were her manager, I'd fire her in a wink.

2) Business lounge at Boston Logan - The experience was just average. The lounge was crowded and the food and drinks spread wasn't very impressive. It felt better than waiting near the gate though.

3) Boarding - Priority (no surprise).

4) In-flight experience - The business class seats were comfortable with a 1-2-1 arrangement. There was enough room to stretch and lie down (I'm a big guy). The in-flight entertainment had limited options and lacked variety. The flight attendants were cordial and the food and drinks were mediocre. What I didn't appreciate was that when my wife asked for breakfast 1 hour before we could land in Paris, the attendant said that there wasn't enough time for a full spread. He offered her 1-2 croissants. Ten minutes later, he served another gentleman seated 1 row ahead with a full breakfast spread. In short, there was no consistency in policy.

Overall, I'd rate this as the worst business class experience I've had. My experiences with Emirates and Lufthansa were far superior, with Emirates being the best. Unfortunately, I'll never fly Air France again.",2019-07,2019-08-15,1.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0
People transportation,Vancouver,Paris,International,"Vancouver to Paris: I was in a row with two other adults: a 1.9m's man and a 1.6m's woman - I am 1.75m tall. In front of us, there were two seats that were pulled back because was a couple with a baby there. After two hours in that cage, the woman was very nice and changed her seat with the man what gave him extra leg space. It was amazing to see the row in the other aisle with the ""regular"" distance.
Paris to Vancouver (5 days after): As I got the first row, I had no problem with my legs BUT my seat was a ""modified"" one (smaller with a short arm's rest). This way, the way I was ""compressed"" by the front seats on the 1st flight, I was ""compressed"" between the passenger on my left and the window on my right.",2019-07,2019-08-15,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0
Confused feelings,Tunis,Lisbon,International,"I flew Air France on december 2018 to attend a conference in Lisbon. I needed to have a connection flight from Paris to Lisbon and the connection time was 50mins. Due to a flight delay, I missed my next leg and they had to accommodate me in a hotel near the airpot and I was booked to a flight the next morning. The thing is I made sure with the guy on the front desk to get my luggage transfered to my new booked flight and to my surprise my suitcase was missing when I finally arrived to Lisbon. I made a baggage reclamation but had to stay a whole week without any notice of it and was obliged to buy new clothes so that I can attend my conference. I had to do the 1000 steps, nagged and sent email after email to which they responded in a short while. To be honest, they gave me a decent recompensation after this incident. Needless to say that my luggage is nowhere to be found up to this moment.",2018-12,2019-08-15,3.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

Terrible airline,Manchester,Mahebourg,International,"After reading some reviews on here I began to worry a little but too late already booked.    To start with our HOP plane was delayed from MAN to CDG this meant we were worried about our connection to MAU. We made it but had to run across CDG to make it connection this meant no food break or toilet break. We also wanted to upgrade but were shooed away from the Air France desk to the plan. We asked again at the desk and was told we could only upgrade if we had enough miles and not pay cash. Once in the plane my husbands entertainment did not work. It was reset and subsequently worked but pretty much useless. In spite of the list of films and tv online there was very little on here. Next the food as a vegetarian mine was ok but the normal meals were awful. This mean 12 hours of no food for my husband and minimal for me. The plane is very cramped with little leg room which is concerning when it‚Äôs such a long flight. 
Overall one of the worst airlines for long haul flights we‚Äôve been on. This meant we made sure we took a lot of food for the return leg so we didn‚Äôt go hungry",2019-08,2019-08-15,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

Much Improved,Bangkok,Paris,International,"Everything was very good.
Very good cabin crew, on time and the 1-2-1 layout is good though it can feel a little cramped even compared to a 2-2-2 layout.
The screen swings out and is ok in size but not big. It is also right in your face  but at least I can reach it if I don't want to use the hand control.
It woud have been an easy engineering job to let the screen sing out then push it a bit further away again.
The food was ok without being great and they have come to their senses and served the 2nd meal 1.5 hours before landing. Last time the 2nd meal came soon after the first with 4 or 5 hours of the flight left.
I still hate the timings and having to wait at CDG for 3 or 4 hours for a 10pm 2nd short flight that is NEVER on time.
The movies was an ok selection.
So much better than my KLM flight going out.
4.5* would be about right.

Not kid-friendly and outdated,Atlanta,Paris,International,"We are a young family and flew internationally twice with Air France in the past 3 months:  Atlanta to Paris to Moscow, and back.  Extremely disappointed with their product, especially for families with kids.  Here's why:

1.  A 3 hr. 45 minute flight from Moscow to Paris had no TVs for kids to watch.  
2.  The Atlanta to Moscow flight did have TVs, but they were very blocky and outdated and you had to almost punch the screen to get them to work.
3.  ***At both starting destinations, the Air France gate representatives took our stroller and made us check it to our final destination (we have a 1 yr. old), insisting we would find kid strollers in Paris to use.  I've never experienced that with any airline, how that can possibly be acceptable in 2019 is beyond me, to make parents carry their 1 yr. old along w/ other kids and luggage the whole way.  We never found an airport stroller on our 1st flight in Paris to use, and the 2nd time in CDG, eventually found one after clearing security but walking a super long time carrying our son.  There were other families along w/ us who were equally shocked about it.  This is customer service at its lowest, to make life more difficult for parents w/ young kids.

Service on the plane itself was good, but other than that, we won't be flying Air France again......",2019-08,2019-08-15,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0

THE WORST!!! My advice go with a different airline.,Boston,Casablanca,International,The worst plane I've ever traveled with. They lost both luggages and they are not doing anything about it. I literally called every number I was given or found online. It's hard to reach them on the phone and once they finally do answer they either speak only french or it's not the right department. Mind you I paid extra $388 for those checked luggages on top of my plane ticket. It's not like they are sending them for free. From Boston to Paris the luggages were sent just fine. Once they arrived to Paris CDG they stayed there because the plane was full. From what I understand they were supposed to send them on the next flight coming to Casablanca.

I was instructed to go on the other side of the airport and pay Menzies Aviation Ticket Office for my baggage.  Menzies did not open until 5:00 a.m.  I barely made my flight.

Excellent passenger service,Paris,Caracas,International,I am 81 years old and on a crowded flight from Paris to Caracas I was impressed by the personal attention I received by the ground staff at boarding and during the 9 hour flight. On the return flight to Paris there were storms over the Atlantic and the seat belt sign was on for over an hour and half. During this time I needed to go to the toilet and pressed the call button. A male steward attended to my call and said it was very dangerous but after a few moments he returned with another steward and they both supported me from front and back to the nearest toilet.They waited for me then escorted me back to my seat. This was beyond their obligation but sums up Air France attention to the confort of their passengers.

Worst experience EVER. 0 stars if possible.,Singapore,Ljubljana,International,"Worst experience for a flight ever with Air France. My flight was cancelled and rerouted TWICE and delayed my travel plans for 12 hours all because of Air France. I had to go to Frankfurt for an addition transit making my total combined flight time 30 hours. And my baggage delayed for 4 days in a winter country without ANY CLOTHES or shops nearby because of Air France. And now when we try to claim, they redirected me to the connecting airline to claim when clearly we booked the flights with Air France. And the other airline is a small carrier who did not reply to any of our emails or calls. Air France customer service is disgusting and the airport staff at Paris airport are rude and self entitled. Nobody was willing to help us to call our Airbnb to inform them of our late arrival. Nobody was willing to help with our luggage. Air France hotline was always engaged when we were trying to call. My cousin who flew the EXACT same route booked Lufthansa and their connecting flight was also cancelled but they have already gotten their FULL COMPENSATION of 600 euros per person from Lufthansa within 1 week. At least Lufthansa owns up and takes responsibility unlike Air France. It has already been 3 months. What a harrowing and disgusting experience we had with Air France. Will never ever take again.

2 out 3 flights were the worst,Boston,Marseille,International,"2 out of the 3 flights we had were the worst. The first flight from Boston to CDG was the only good experience. Our connecting flight to Marseille was the worst. Lots of shuttles and delays and they tool our boarding passes. When we asked what was going on and when we would get to the connecting flight, we were told to just sit. There was no communication or explanation. Once we got to the gate, the gate agent said it was a full flight and would we like to check our carryon bags that we gladly did. I asked if we could bring the walker onto the plane for my husband who has an above knee amputation and she said yes.  When we got to the plane, the flight attendant at the door was extremely rude. She never said welcome aboard or Bon Jour. The first words to me were (with lots of tone), ""YOU can't bring that on the plane, it is too big."" I nicely said that the gate agent said that we could.  She then said, ""NO it is too big and you have to check it."" Then she also said with lots of attitude, ""Are you American!""  Welcome to the land of rude French people was introduction.  On the second flight home from Paris, there were two delays that we dealt with and was okay while we met some nice Americans in the airport and chatted. Then the gate started the scanning process to the plane. Everyone was in the hot and crowded jetway for over 30 minutes because of another delay. They again had no communication and should have kept everyone in the terminal instead of in the hot jetway with no place to sit. My husband had to stand without the aid if his walker that had a seat because once again, it had to be checked. There were many families with small kids and babies in the hot jetway. There was no reason for that to have happened and another delay in the terminal would have been better. I will never fly Air France again. Nor will I ever go to the land of rude people France. There was a ""customer service"" person who walked down 2 people that she chatted with and had her back turned to the other 326 people on the flight.  When people were trying to ask her what was going on, she said that she had her two passengers that she was with. Guess they had loyalty points, but the hell with the other 326 people.  The excuse was that they were still cleaning the plane!  Find that hard to believe that the plane was there during the other 2 delays in the terminal. Also, there were no safety cards about the aircraft to review for exits, etc. in the seat pockets or the inflight magazines.  So much for cleaning and safety. No thank you for flying with us when exiting any of the planes when I thanked them. Guess since I was an American and said thank instead of Merci.",2019-08,2019-08-07,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0

"Poor Customer Service, Surprised and Disappointed",Paris,London,Europe,"I am very disappointed to have to write this review, but after the consistently poor experiences I have had with Air France at every level of the travel experience, I feel obliged to warn fellow travelers.  After booking my flight from Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport back to London Heathrow two months in advance, I arrived at the airport to check in a few hours before my flight only to learn that Air France had overbooked the flight, and I might not be able to board.  They told me that if I came back in about an hour, I could check to see if I could get a ticket.  I came back an hour later (after sitting on the floor in the terminal due to lack of available seating nearby) and they gave me what appeared to be the equivalent of a stand by ticket and told me to head down to the gate.  I have no clue why they did not do this to begin with.  At this point, I had about 10 minutes to make it through security and find the gate before boarding closed after intentionally having arrived hours in advance to avoid having to rush.  When I finally arrived at the gate, other standby customers who had likely received different and perhaps better information from another employee and had arrived before me.  Three of the five standby customers were able to board, and I ended up being denied.  Instead of putting me on another flight an hour and a half later that would have still allowed me to make a connecting flight from London back to the US as I requested, Air France put me on a 4pm flight, a flight 6 and a half hours behind my original flight that they had refused to allow me to board.  At this point I am tired, hungry, and very disappointed that I will be arriving in the US a day late due to Air France's disorganization.  I went to the compensation desk as instructed and was given the choice between an Air France voucher towards a future flight or having money deposited in my account.  I selected the latter option, and the employee assured me that I would see the money deposited in my account.  One month later, no money has been deposited, and upon closer inspection, I see that the receipt she gave me is actually a voucher for a future Air France flight, which is the exact opposite of what I chose.  I am currently on a 35 minute wait with Air France customer service in an attempt to claim my appropriate compensation for denied boarding and haven't even been able to speak with anyone yet.  I am disappointed and frankly schocked that what was presumably a flagship French airline would have such slipshod operation and abominable customer service.  Ironically, my original flight from London to Paris on a much cheaper airline, Easy Jet, went off without a hitch!  I went with Air France over other airlines for my return flight because of its name recognition and status as a major airline in addition to the ability to fly straight into Heathrow.  I stand corrected.  Majorly disappointed.  I did give them 2 starts because once I finally got on the flight, the flight itself wasn't bad and they did give me a lunch voucher for the time that I was stranded in the airport.",2019-06,2019-08-05,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0

Our first time on AF!,Miami,Pointe-a-Pitre,Caribbean,"I think because it was convenient to Air France our booked flight was delayed by 10 hours.

Their luggage rules are worded strangely but basically it's the same as when flying in the US.  I wasn't sure so I asked an Air France customer service agent and she told me that I need to check them.  I've never flown Air France, so I followed what she said.

Late & Bad Food,Washington DC,Paris,International,"My first time flying Air France has left me less than impressed. For starters, the boarding process started an hour late. We then sat on the tarmac for nearly 90 minutes. This meant we took off 2 hours and 30 minutes late. Unfortunately, we had a connecting train at CDG that was scheduled for 2 hours and 30 minutes after our plane was scheduled to arrive at CDG. These delays prompted us to try and switch our train ticket to a later time in the day, but *guess what* Air France does not have WiFi on-board their planes, so we were not able to do that. 

Beyond that, the food was shockingly terrible in economy. Like Airline food is renowned for being not good, but it almost felt like Air France made a concerted effort to serve bad food. On our flight to Paris, the meal I had was chicken in some pepper sauce with kale in mashed potatoes and a side of Texas salad, which apparently was cold rice and beans. It was like they were trying to do Southwest food never having traveled to the Southwest or had good food before. 

The other annoying thing about the Air France flight was their entertainment system was terrible. It looks like it was designed in 1990 and it works about as well. Selecting anything on the menu would take ages to load. If you did not press the touch screen with as much force as possible, the touch screen would register the selection. This means that every-time you want to select something new you are bouncing the chair of the person in front of you or they are bouncing yours. 

Finally, after arriving in CDG about 85 minutes after our scheduled arrival time, we ended up missing our train by only 5 minutes. Unfortunately, rescheduling our trains came at a price of over 100$. So far my efforts to contact Air France about getting this money back have been summarily ignored. 

My general frustration with Air France is that they do not seem to care about customer service nor the customer experience, skimping on everything that one might consider the bare-minimum on a Transatlantic flight be a major legacy airline.",2019-07,2019-08-01,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0

Inability to Get Refund for Inaccurate Baggage Charge,Paris,Houston,International,"On July 10, I flew from Paris to Houston on the return portion of a round trip ticket purchased from Delta for a flight operated by Air France.  When I checked my baggage, the automated kiosk charged me 85 Euros, despite the fact that I got a free checked bag with my ticket.  (Purchased on a Delta/American Express credit card!)  I stood in another line to ask the Air France agents for a refund.  They took my credit card and I thought they were giving me a refund - but they charged me another 30 Euros for my seat!  I only had one checked bag.  When I spoke to Delta while waiting in line to drop the bag and go through security (almost an hour!), they said it was obvious that I should not have been charged.  However, I cannot seem to get any other Delta employee to focus on this or get a refund from Air France.

Premium Economy Won't Help Sleep,New York City,Tel Aviv,International,"Flew Premium Economy from JFK to Paris, and Economy from Paris to Tel Aviv.  It was actually easier to sleep in Economy rather than Premium Economy as the seat goes back farther and the headrest keeps your head straight better.  The seats are wider in Premium Economy, you get first class earphones/headsets, the food is first class, your get more leg room, and on the A380 you get your own bathroom.  On the 777 however, that bathroom is shared with coach.  Otherwise the experience is the same on the two aircraft except boarding the A380 at JFK was a zoo.  The signs when we arrived were set up one way for the upper deck and another way for the lower deck.  After getting everyone into line, they then just moved the signs around so that where the upper deck signs were they were put where the lower deck signs were originally, and the vice versa for the lower deck signs.  As you can imagine, chaos broke out as everyone had to switch lines after they had gotten into line because everything was reversed!

Note you get priority baggage and Delta One check in in addition to those features in the cabin.  Is it worth the extra $900 per seat?  Depends what you want.  If you want those trimmings but can afford not sleeping, it is fine.  Otherwise save your money and stay in coach.",2019-07,2019-07-30,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0

I sat on the aisle and each time my son got up to use the restroom, I didn't even have to get out of my seat to let him by.  We each had our own noise cancelling headphones provided and the movie selection was outstanding.  There were bottles of water waiting at our seats for us and they served us drinks no less than four time during the flight. The pillows, blankets, slippers and masks they provided were fantastic and helped to make it even easier to get some sleep in the reclining seats with foot rests.

"Bad, bad experience",Montreal,Paris,International,"The concept of connecting flights seems to be unknown to the Air France. In both directions of my round trip, the flight was late at the start for more than 1 hour. The airplane was old and entertainment screen did not work. For those that worked around me, people struggled as the screens were badly responding to touch. The plane was late at the arrival for 1.5 hours and we struggled to get on the next connecting flight and lost our reservations because of that. The seats were very uncomfortable, both ways. On the return trip, there was no serving drinks nor water, except for, it seems, employees of Air France travelling on the same trip - as they received extra attention. The stewardesses were barely speeking English and were not as pleasant. They seemed to struggle with carts and were bumping at the passenger's shoulders or knees. So it seems this is my last trip with Air France ever. Oh, almost forgot - none of our bags arrived on the same flight, as they never left Montreal and it took them 4 days to find them and ship them to the final destination.

Dear God Don‚Äôt Do It,Florence,Amsterdam,Europe,"After multiple times with Air France, my family and I have experienced a horrible experience every single time. From losing luggage, to bad staff, to bad pilots. It‚Äôs comically awful. On our most recent flight, we arrived at the airport 2 hours before our flight and it took us a whole hour just to check in at the front desk. There was one attendant for the economy line (bursting with customers) and two attendants for the priority line. As soon as the priority line finished, the two attendants, rather than helping the still bustling economy line, took an hour long smoke break or something (at 10 in the morning.) Every boarding process has been inefficient and delayed. On the plane itself, aside from the heart attack inducing take offs and landings, the food service isn‚Äôt that great. I understand that delays and poor service are prone to happen at airports due to any sort of interference, but from my experience it is clear that Air France is operating an entirely inefficient operation.

Worst airline ever. Worst flying experience ever,Madrid,Paris,Europe,"Don't EVER fly with Air France. We were flying with my all service dog in the cabin from Madrid to Paris. First of all, emotional support dogs are supposed to fly for free but they don't in Air France. We paid, and it was not cheap. Second, we had stated many days before that we were flying with a service dog and they said ok. The day of the flight, we went to do the check-in at the airport and they told us we had not stated that we were flying with a service dog. Then, on the flight, flight attendants were very rude. Every flight I have ever been in with my service dog, they let me take him out of the carrier and let him sit on top of me and sleep there. But not here. They came and told me to put him back in the carrier and then proceeded to try to take it away from way with my dog in it very aggressively and violently. The flight attendant, which was a guy, was pulling my dog away from me. If I had not pulled back, he would have taken my dog away from me I don't know where. At the end of the flight, we went and talked to the pilot. He apologized saying they didn't know he was a support dog. They did know. We had told them. Don't ever fly with them.

Horrible Customer Service and worst Airline,Chennai (Madras),Chicago,International,"I have a scheduled trip for my family from India to USA on July 23 and the flight is from MAA to ORD via Delhi & Paris. The ticket was booked and when my family tried to check in at the MAA airport, the person at the check in said we have to get our baggage at Delhi airport and re-Check-in at Delhi. I asked them it is a single journey &why should i recheck-in and they said it is Air-France issue as my domestic flight was through Air-India even though the ticket was booked through Air-France website as a entire journey. So i did recheck-in & asked the Air-France check in at Delhi about the baggage and Air-France said that ""Oh, Air-India and Air-France has a tie up and we don't know why Air-India said that. Please ask Air-India about that"". That's how they care about us. We landed at Paris airport and had a wait time of 9 hours and hence i decided to get the Lounge service at the airport as stated on their website that it can be accessed for a fee of ‚Ç¨50 per person. When i reached them and asked for the Lounge access, Air-France said that your wait time is too long and we cannot give you the Lounge access as Air-France expects more people to access the Lounge. I didn't understand what the heck they are speaking, all they want is people with shorter wait time to access the Lounge so that they can make more money. That's how the Air-France works that they want to make more money or discriminate people that you don't qualify for the class to access the Lounge.",2019-07,2019-07-26,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
Great flight!,Washington DC,Paris,International,"I have flown this flight a few times.  It is the double decker plane.  I have no complaints.  I like flying Air France.  You get a menu for dinner and that includes free alcholic drinks (both to and from the U.S.) no matter what class of service you are flying.  During the flight, after food is served there is also a beverage ""station"" where they have a help-your-self type choice of drinks.  The staff is friendly and the overhead bins are big.  

I traveled with a group of students this time, so I had to sit in economy.  The leg room was fine.  Luckily, I didn't have anyone next to me and I could use that space too.  I have also flown this flight in premium economy and the legroom was more spacious.  

The entertainment wasn't as good this time around in my opinion.  I didn't see anything that I would want to watch.  However, that may be different for you.

I am so intrigued by flying on a double decker airplane.  It's like a massive building in the air.  I like how the plane has three cameras on the outside of it where you can see yourself landing, taking off and flying in the air.

Strictly travel,Houston,Paris,International,"When you are traveling, the only thing that matters is comfort from your little cramped up Economy seat, trying to make the best of the available space.
I setup all possible alarms to check in online to get hold of the best possible FREE seat in the flight and Vola, I get the Exit row Window seat. My smiles were from ear to ear as i was gonna have the best possible flight with all the possible leg room. I enter the flight and i could see my seat all empty decked up in colour BLUE. I grab my seat and you know the feeling where u think this is not going as per plan, not the best seat you could get with an alarm for early morning. I try and calm myself down but things had already taken a turn.
My seat had a diagonal wall coming inside which made me sit in a awkward tilt position. The back of the seat had metal poking into me with no cushion at all to cover the frame. When i asked the cabin crew, all they gave me a few more pillows so that i could rest my back on the chair with no comfort.
The toilets stink worse than most of public toilets which hardly get cleaned.
Apart from my seat being below average, everything else was average.
Except for the middle eastern airlines, all airlines are functional in terms of their duty to transport us from destination A to B leaving behind the luxury.

Enjoyed Cushy business class after chaotic boarding,Paris,San Francisco,International,"The Business Class lounge was fantastic. We didn‚Äôt use the massage and spa services, but there were nap rooms and showers, and nicely equipped rest rooms. 

The food was decent and a full bar was available. Good beverage/espresso selection, also. All self service and complimentary. The seating options varied throughout the lounge; velvet banquettes, cafe tables, lounge chairs, etc.

The flight would have been much more enjoyable if the boarding hadn‚Äôt started with my husband‚Äôs boarding pass not working (after I‚Äôd already passed thru the gate with I realized he wasn‚Äôt with me).  I walked back to the counter and saw a large group of passengers having the same problem. No information was given to them. The scene was agitating because of the lack of information. I could see that they‚Äôd been pulled aside for a last minute security check, as there was a security table out of their sight right next to the boarding ramp. Passengers held there were worried and most were separated from their families. One teenage girl had been separated from her father, and she was in tears. Passports were taken from the passengers in this group, and they were taken 2-3 at a time to the random screening area for an explosive detecting hand wipe. Then their passports and boarding passes were given back to them.

We paid for business class, which should mean priority boarding, but my husband was last through this process. I was so worried that something was wrong with his boarding pass that I was afraid to board without him. So, even though I have a painful back problem, I stood with my carry-on and waited over 20 minutes to be sure everything went through. I was really anxious. So the start to our flight was HORRIBLE.

The business class pods were comfortable and clean. The seats laid fairly flat, and I was pretty comfortable. There is a cabinet to store items you want to access during the flight, and other considerate touches. The service on my husbands aisle (pods are one-two-one, so all  pods have aisle access) was excellent. I think they were training flight attendants on my side; I was several times passed over for beverages, bread, etc. 

The food was pretty good. Even the rolls were soft. The menu was pretty comprehensive for most tastes, and all courses were enjoyable. If I drank wine, I‚Äôm sure I would have enjoyed the selection.

The toilets remained clean and well stocked throughout the flight.

The entertainment system was EXCELLENT, with an adjustable pull out screen. There were movies from many countries with subtitles in many languages. My husband and I synced our screens and watched some great Korean historical action films together.

Air France business class gives a nice pair of slippers and a nicely designed neoprene bag with essentials, I‚Äôm still using it for other things.

Even if the security check pre-boarding wasn‚Äôt their fault, Air France personnel could have done a much better job communicating what was going on. 

In spite of this, I did enjoy my flight. I would fly Air France business class in the future, as long as I was on a plane equipped with pods.",2019-07,2019-07-24,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0

Birmingham to Ljubljana with change at Paris,Birmingham,Ljubljana,International,"Journey Birmingham to Paris with a change of craft to Ljubljana.

Plane on second part of journey was changed so seats reallocated; again we were kept together. We were encouraged to put carry on luggage in the hold although we didn't have to.

Pretty sure that the guy next to me did not put his mobile on flight mode as he was sending messages and looking things up on the internet, but staff didn't question his continual use of phone.

Not good,Mahebourg,Paris,International,"Flew from Mauritius to Paris with Air France. First of, the flight was delayed due to some technical problems with the ovens (kitchen) on the plane. The plane held a much lower standard than the plane we flew on the way to Mauritius. The dinner served on board was poor quality, and not tasty at all.

I got very sick a few hours after take off, but recieved minimal help and assistance from the flights crew. The crew made me feel very unwelcome.

Above and beyond expectations,Toronto,Paris,International,"My husband and I have traveled widely but had never flown with Air France before. We tried  AF because it seemed the logical choice, it was a direct flight to Paris and reasonably priced. We found the staff pleasant and helpful, even before we boarded the plane. The real surprise came with the distribution of refreshing facecloths before our evening on-board meal. We were handed menus (never happened with any other airlines) and champagne was offered as an ap√©ritif. We had the salade aux sept grains and chose the poulet sauce au poivre et vin de X√©r√®s. We had wine with our meal, there was cheese and crumble aux pommes for dessert. All tasty and fresh. My husband aslo had a cognac for digestif and all this was included with our economy ticket. We couldn't get over it. We also noticed our baggage was delivered promptly, no long waits for the carrousel to start rolling. This may not have been Air France's doing but it was nevertheless noticeable. The flight back was just as pleasant. From now on, whenever possible, we will be flying with Air France.",2019-07,2019-07-23,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Terrible Trip,Washington DC,New Delhi,International,"Departure:
On Sat. July 7, I was scheduled to travel in business class from Washington DC to Delhi, India. The trip had two legs (DC to Paris, Paris to Delhi) with a three hour layover in CDG airport in Paris. The morning of the trip, I checked the flight status and found the first leg was delayed by 2 hours and 50 minutes, this made it impossible to make the second leg of flight. There was no proactive notification from the airline notifying me of the delay, Because of that I had to move my entire trip to Sunday (1 full day later) which had significantly impact to my schedule. So the first two legs of my journey where impacted and rescheduled

Arrival:
On July 12, I was scheduled to travel in business class from Delhi, India to Washington DC, and there was a 5 hour layover (in Paris CDG airport). Five minutes before the second leg of the flight there was a notification by AirFrance that the flight was being delayed by another 3 hours. This turned a 5 hour layover into a 8 hour delay. As a business class traveler I was entitled to use the AF lounge but my associate was traveling business economy and because of this he was denied access to the AF lounge. The woman working at the front desk of the AF lounge denied my associate access to the lounge and in addition, she was extremely rude and uncaring that we had already been waiting for 5 hours and now have 3 more hours to wait (total of 8 hours). I chose to stay with my associate so we sat in the waiting area at the airport gate. 

Overview:
-3 of the four legs of my journey where adversely impacted by scheduling changes by AirFrance
-Little to no proactive notification of the changes
-Denial of access to the AF lounge for a business economy traveler
-Extremely rude woman at front desk of AF lounge 
-There is no attempt from AF to address these issues

Lovely Coach Experience,Paris,New York City,International,"My family recently traveled home from vacation in Paris, and had the pleasure of flying on Air France. We are all tall, yet didn‚Äôt experience any discomfort from the space our knees had to occupy. The flight included two meals, and multiple drink services. The meals were tasty and included extra servings of bread, if desired. There were enough ‚Äúextra‚Äù foods included with the entrees that even our picky eater had enough to eat. The airline employees were also very friendly and patient throughout the entire flight, which made for a comfortable environment. And the entertainment provided in the seatback TVs was broad and diverse: TV, movies, games, music, etc. They even provided headphones and an eye/sleeping mask to everyone, in addition to a pillow and blanket.

NEVER Fly Air France - so many better options,Los Angeles,Paris,International,"I've been married to my Frenchie for 7 years - and part of our deal is that we go to France every summer (poor me, haha).  

I've done 8 trips in these 7 years, each one occurring with Air France...until now.  I will never, EVER fly this airline again...and words escape me by how bad poor our most recent experience was.

We now have a 20-month old baby - and we bought her an extra seat for this most recent trip for ease more space, an d peace of mind.... even though, technically, she can still sit on our lap (its a 12 hour flight from LA).

As we checked out baby car seat during check-in, the lady asked what was in the bag (it was quite bulky).  We told her our car seat, and the usual policy is carseats are free to check.  What happened next was absolutely atrocious:

The manager came out and told us that we HAD to take the car seat on the plane.  Even though we spent $1,500 for an extra seat AND the baby is under 2 years old and can legally sit on our laps during take off and landing, they told us it was policy that the car seat needs to go on the plane (which would essentially make a difficult 12-hour flight with a baby completely unbearable).

The car seat is HUGE and would have left zero space for us to maneuver in our row of 3).

I gently asked then 'what would have happened if we didn't bring a car seat to the airport'?  The reply: 'it doesn't matter, you have one now'.  HUH?  Never once during buying these very expensive tickets did ANY communication indicate that it was illegal to not bring a carseat to the airport.  We didn't get an email, it wasn't on the ticket, and nothing ever said 'please make sure to bring a car seat for the flight - it is our policy').

I told them we did this exact trip the year before with 3 seats and a baby under 2.  'We changed the policy'.  I asked to see the policy, and they said 'it doesn't matter, we have no obligation to show if to you'.  

I then said I was gonna go put the carseat on the curb (it was a cheap one and we were 50/50 on bringing it anyway)...and this is where there main guy, the manager, started screaming on top of his lungs 'they are NOT getting on the plane!!  Do NOT let these people on the plane' - he was shouting it to all the agents in a row, making a scene in JFK I've never seen before.

If I had a video for this it would have gone WAY viral on Youtube - hundreds of people in JFK were pretty much in awe.  

We've had many problems with Air France over the years - they are uncompromising and non-customer centric.  But this was the icing on the cake.

My friends - never, EVER fly Air France.  This comes from a sober, kind man who never has a problem with anybody.  You can fly United, American, Lufthansa, so many other great airlines to Paris.

Oh, by the way, do you want to know what happened?  I ended up acquiescing (I had no power - they were literally not gonna let us on) and we lugged the carseat to the gate.  As we entered the plane, 3 attendants asked us why we had the car seat if we had an extra seat and the baby was under 2?  They happily checked the thing at the gate, and we didn't have to deal with it.

On the return trip home - they let us check the carseat from the beginning.  SOME policies they have there, huh?   Bottom line - for whatever reason that freaking dude was just WANTING to be extremely difficult.  

Horrible, terrible customer service.......

Not what one might expect from a global airline in Business class,Fort-de-France,Paris,International,"This was the conclusion of an anniversary vacation and cruise - and just about the only way back from Martinique to the UK. So let's start with a word of warning. This is deemed to be a French internal flight so it operates into Paris Orly, whereas almost all connecting passengers need to transfer to Charles de Gaulle for their onward flights. After an 8 hour overnight flight, no one really wants to have to collect their bags, find their way to the Bus Direct bus stop and hassle against another 50 people all wanting to get on the bus. But beggar's can't be choosers. AF - why not put these long haul flights into CDG?

Our flight just happened to coincide with Carnival in Martinique, and for a start it seemed that every member of the crew had wives, husbands, lovers and kids with them - we observed the captain and the purser (both of whom were accompanied) sitting working over the seating plan on their i-pads whilst they awaited their crew bus from the hotel. So, captain's wife ended up with him on the flight deck all the way home - well, not quite, she also joined in 'upstairs' in the flight crew's rest area. One of our stewardesses had her daughter with her, who was not well, sitting in a cabin crew jump seat for the whole flight. The young man with the purser spent most of the flight on the floor adjacent to the front main passenger door curled up asleep. It was more like a refugee flight than a business class flight with a reputable airline.

The seats, which masquerade as 'lie flat' are in fact on a slight slope of 175', and are the same as Air France fitted to all their long haul aircraft more than 20 years ago.

When we got away, we were served a decent meal but by a somewhat grumpy stewardess. And the wines were OK - but being a French airline, of course, there was no non-French wines to savour, just one red Bordeaux and one red Burgundy, and the same for the whites.

Breakfast was a limited menu, peremptorily served. And in the last few minutes of the flight, the senior purser, who had not been seen all flight, then came round obsequiously to wish us 'au revoir et bonne journee' by name.

By contrast, our connecting flight from CDG to Amsterdam, by Air France, was so professionally crewed by a purser who cared about her passengers and managed to serve drinks and a full tray snack and coffee, and clear away in under 40 minutes.",2019-03,2019-07-20,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.1219191587249426,2.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0
Would not recommend this airline unless you have no option,Montpellier,Venice,Europe,"My daughter and I were going to Venice to catch a cruise. We had a lot of luggage as my daughter had been living in Montpellier and now coming back home. After paying the 70 Euro for excess luggage we realised it would only be an extra 29 euro to upgrade to business so sought to get a refund of the 70 Euro and pay for 2 business class upgrades. The staff at Montprllier airport were amazing( so great first but alas last impression of AF) and took the trouble to contact the accounts area who confirmed my 70 Euro had been cancelled and I would be refunded.
We arrived at Venice at 730 at night only find my luggage did not make it( despite me having paid business class upgrade). I was told it would be on the first flight and arrive inVeincd at 9 am so had to soend the night with no clean clothes which was not great. The next day brought no joy - I had to call AF customer service ( something they defintely do not have) numerous times to try and locate my luggage. Only 1 staff member named Chris understood my distress and tried very hard to help, I boarded the cruise ship with no certainty where my luggage was and only got my bag 15 minutes before the cruise ship departed Venice. A very unpleasant experience compounded by very rude and unhelpful Air France staff I had to deal with.
To top off it has been 4 weeks and I have yet to receive my 70 Euro refund despite a number of emails to Air France. I did get a response to my email initially confirming the money would be paid back but the only communications since then have been to tell e my reference number has changed ( it started as Delta thn Air France now KLm).

No Shame,New Delhi,Valencia,International,"I was offered two return flights that I would miss the connection in Paris and I had to point that out to them So they booked me on a 3rd flight which missed the connection.

I was offered 15 euros for snacks for the 8 hours delay in paris. Obviously they have never bought airport food.
Because of this delay I was charged an extra 20 euros parking. I was asked to forward receipt 10 weeks ago. I was told someone would contact me soon, I sent several whatsapps reminders and got the same response each time. 
Air France claimed the delay was beyond their control. Considering they knew they needed extra time to fly around Pakistan, it was most certainly avoidable. They knew before they offered the flight. I wasted a day in the airport, Thanks Air France

24 hour check in!!!,Paris,Florence,Europe,"I have had the worst experience with Air France at CDG airport. I am currently on standby for a flight I paid for 5 months ago, simply because I didn‚Äôt reserve a seat and check in 24 hours after my flight. Since I am on vacation, and WiFi is hard to come by, I figured I‚Äôd be okay to check in at the airport. Unfortunely not, 3 hour before departure is not enough notice. Customer service is useless, and all they told me to do was wait for 2 hours and come back before boarding time.

"Check in mess, rude staff!!! Never again!",Paris,Edinburgh,Europe,"We travelled with 2 kids from Paris to Edinburgh, we arrived at Charles de Gaulle check in area and it was a completely mess... long queues without signs, we had our online check in done and boarding passes, just needed the luggage tags but it was impossible to understand were to queue as there were queues everywhere! 
I tried to ask at least 5 Air France staff and they ignore you, finally one told me to queue on one line, when we finally arrived a very rude man told us we were in the wrong queue and send us to a new line to start queuing all over again!! We explained that Air France staff sent us to that line but he didn‚Äôt care! Again queuing for 20 minutes and they sent us again to other line to get the tags from the electronic self service machines, it that had good and clear signs we would have done that initially without queuing twice for nothing!!
Finally we had our tags and managed to drop our bags! Took us more than an hour and we had donde everything online before!

My flight companion has celiac disease. We had requested a gluten free meal from Malaga to New York prior to leaving the United States. But, with the last minute flight changes she was out of luck. Previously, on KLM they had come up with an alternative food for her. Air France said, ""too bad"" you needed to request a special meal 2 days before flying. We did not have time to purchase her any special food in Paris because we needed to change terminals, go through border control, and get on board the plane.

If they have people who are unstable working at the airport, I certainly would not recommend  flying them.  We filed a complaint because my husband had to buy another ticket and fly the next day, but of course we got the standard form letter that said sorry no refund.   Please for your sanity, do not fly them.  There are so many other airlines that are great so there is no reason to fly them.  I can see from the horrible reviews that Air France doesn't care about customer service so I am sure this will fall on deaf ears......

Never again for many reasons!,Paris,Atlanta,International,"Where do I start? We had so many travel issues on our flights! The main one, besides the delayed and then damaged baggage and missed connection, was the cancellation of our return reservation. No one could tell us why it was canceled, but perhaps it had to do with rerouting and re-ticketing on the front end. Regardless, I didn‚Äôt discover the mishap until we tried to check in for our flight. I spent over two hours on international phone calls trying to figure out what had happened. They were able to re-ticket us, but no longer in the exit row seats I had purchased 8 months prior! Our family of 4 were given the only seats available (or so we were told) on the original booked flight which was on an A-380. The very back row of the upper deck next to the toilet were our new seats. Oh, and the kicker was the in-flight entertainment didn‚Äôt work in any of our four seats for a 9-hour flight! We were offered a 60‚Ç¨ compensation for the issue. I declined as that did not seem fair to me. I dealt with Air France customer service yesterday. They admit it was all their mistake, yet they offered us a similar compensation. I‚Äôm very disappointed with everything! If anyone was given the choice of 60‚Ç¨ or 9 hours of in flight entertainment during the flight, no one would have chosen the money. It‚Äôs just not adequate compensation! It was a miserable experience! We didn‚Äôt get what we paid for. They did refund my money for the exit row seats we didn‚Äôt get to use, but of course they should do that! 
Regarding the Air France A-380, I was really looking forward to this experience. I had read a lot a great reviews on it. Let me say, we all agreed it was a not the nicest plane. It was worn beyond any plane I‚Äôve ever been on. We were on one coming and going and we were sorely disappointed with it. The food was mostly inedible also. There‚Äôs no WiFi offered either. It feels like an old plane that needs some TLC and updating badly. I will also mention to those who get motion sickness, there‚Äôs a steady rocking back and forth sensation on the upper deck that made me sick. I threw up on the plane and I‚Äôve never done that before. Nine hours of swaying is a bit much I guess. The flight attendant said that it was an above average turbulent flight. It didn‚Äôt feel like turbulence. It felt like it rocked back and forth. Anyways...we will not be taking any more flights with AirFrance or on one of their A-380‚Äôs ever again.

  My wife and I arrived at Fort Myers airport at around 1pm on the 14th march 2019 for a 3:19pm flight to Manchester via Atlanta and Amsterdam, we boarded the flight around 2:30pm, just after 3pm we were informed that there was a problem and they were trying to fix it. The temperature that day was in the high 80c and there was minimal air-conditioning on board due to the problem, after about 30 minutes we were offered the choice to leave the aircraft with the proviso that if the problem was fixed this would further delay the aircraft. We chose to stay onboard however at no time were refreshments' offered not even water.
At about 4:30pm we disembarked after being told that the problem could not be resolved and that representatives would be available in the airport to rebook our flights. Two agents were sent to deal with around 200 passengers it took us around 90minutes of queuing to get to speak to a agent again with no refreshment offered even when requested by numerous customers. We were informed us that there were no further flights that day and we would be transfer to flights the next day. I enquired about over night accommodation and meal vouchers and was told that they were having difficulty finding hotels and that they no longer provided meals for delayed flights, at this point I asked to speak to a manager and was told non were available as they had finished for the day, I then asked them to call a manager and was told that they were unable to make outside phone calls from the check in desk or anywhere else in the airport. At about 8pm we were informed that they had found accommodation and we were given vouchers for the hotel and transport, I again asked for meal vouchers and was given the same answer as earlier.
We collected our baggage which had been left unattended in the baggage claim area and caught a taxi to the hotel, after checking in I asked what time the restaurant closed as it was now around 9pm and we had had nothing to eat since about 11am, we were informed that they had no restaurant but did have a selection of takeaway menus, We took a selection of these to our room to choose from. Once we had decided what we wanted we checked the phone number  only to see that they stopped delivering at 9pm, on checking the others we found that they all stopped at 9pm. We went back down to reception to ask if there were an restaurants in the area, we were told that there was a mall on the other side of the I75 back down and unlit road with no pavement so of we set, there were a number of restaurants at the mall unfortunately they all closed at 9pm except Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts so dinner that evening consisted of coffee a toasted sandwich and doughnuts and then the walk back. On our return to the hotel I decided to check in for the flights to find we had already been allocated seating in different parts of the plane for the first two flights and that the word misconnection was typed in red over the last leg, I went in to the system to try and change our seats however there were no adjacent seats available on either flights, at that point I had had enough and decided to try and sort it out at the airport the next day. They did manage to seat us together for the return journey after some discussions at the airport however the flight was further delayed leaving Fort Myers leading to a missed connection at Atlanta requiring an other rebooking which lead to missing the flight out of Chares de Gaulle and an other rebooking and just to add insult to injury this flight was also late departing in fact so late that a later flight took of first. So OK I thought I'm covered by EU legislation but no seemingly I had been transferred to Delta Airlines a US company flying from a US airport so not entitled to any compensation. So the moral of this story if you book flights with Air France to the US and anything goes wrong expect to be told your flying Delta.",2019-01,2019-07-13,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.1219191587249426,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0

- The cabin and the seats were very well designed. Very chic with French style of colors. The leather seats were very spacious with practical spaces. There are spaces next to the seats to put your small bag with little mirror inside. Very practical for women.
- There was a small bottle of water in the space next to the seats so if you are thirsty when you get on board you can just drink this. And of course it‚Äôs Evian.
- Greeting and welcome drink was nice. Great service. The staffs are very smiley and helpful. They also speak a lot of languages so it is very international.
-The pouch of amenities was very cute, well designed. All the things inside were French brand, very great quality(lip balm and hand cream from Clarins)

"Mainly positive, with a few delays and adjustments",New York City,Marseille,International,"I was surprised when Air France suggested booking the flight from JFK to Marseille with only a 1 hour and 40 minute layover in Paris (CDG), but since they suggested it, I booked this option. The JFK flight was delayed by over two hours, meaning that we missed our connecting flight in Paris. They rebooked us on a flight leaving that evening from Orly airport, but Air France does not provide transit from CDG to Orly--you have to pay to get yourself from one to the other.

Overall, I like Air France and will fly them again, was just a bit disappointed in how much we had to search on our own to figure out how to get from CDG to Orly (it was hard to find Air France employees who knew the best way to do that) and the fact that their delay cost us more money.",2019-06,2019-07-11,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0

25 day WWC trip,Paris,Los Angeles,International,"We came in on a TVG train from Lyon to Pairs, France the night before our flight. Took a cab ($26E) to our hotel. Didn‚Äôt know there was a route bus. Stay in an on site hotel (within the airport) if possible. A little most $$ but much lest of a hassle!

The flying out process of getting through from the hotel to the boarding gate is a journey in it‚Äôs self. 
Allow at LEAST 3 hours. 
Know your terminal and your ticket check-in counter for checked luggage.
Flying business or Economy Plus helps. The economy check-in and customs lines are longer.
Get pre cleared with eye scan if possible. This will save 20 to 60 minutes to get through customs required to get out of the country. 

Our tram boarded at 6:43 for our 10am flight. We were in the middle of the route and we had to squeeze in. At the last stop people couldn‚Äôt get on the bus-no room. 
Then the long walk to the main terminal building terminal #2 from the tram stop. Thank goodness for the lifts, not elevators but ‚Äúlifts‚Äù. A few directions and off to 2E terminal on the tram. Some more directions and Priory check in unit #5.  Found help printing baggage and boarding tickets to be able to go through to baggage checkin. We checked in on line the night before but couldn‚Äôt print passes and the email was sent to our agents address, not ours. Thus no wallet pass!  A few security questions and then the first wait to the baggage check-in counter. Cleared that then walked to customs for our second wait line. These people are in no hurry. A 100 passengers waiting for one agent is no problem for them. Remember eye scan? 40 minutes would have been saved and there were 100 people behind us.
Finally to the gate. 2 hours and 20 minutes.  We stopped for coffee and had 30 minutes to boarding. Our third security check. Priority line 2 because we flew Plus. An hour to load the plane. Ready to go. NOPE. Some how a few people didn‚Äôt go thought any security checks and had to be contacted at their seats. An hour delay.
Then we taxi and wheels up. Food was good. Glad we didn‚Äôt pay extra 50E per for better meals. Good movie list and wine!
Priority baggage with business or plus is first off. US security with Global entry and we flew by to check out and we were on our way home.",2019-06,2019-07-10,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,3.0

The only element of the flight I was unhappy with was the water I was given - a tiny carton of water which spilled all over me when I opened it and because it was full to the brim, I had to use a second plastic cup to drink from.  Air France need to be educated about the impact of single use plastic on the environment, and I certainly learned my lesson not to leave my water bottle at home!

I also had issues getting my ticket on the app for my return flight, which was not an issue on the way out.  It was easily resolved by printing my ticket on the self check-in unit.

And when you get lost, its amazing shops become dangerous traps. I spent $500 so fast that I think its part of the master plan!

Great Flight on Air France Premium Economy,Seattle,Paris,International,"I tried to use frequent flyer miles for this trip, but it didn't work out. We ended up paying full price for premium economy. It was expensive but worth it to us. On the flight from Seattle to Paris, my husband and I had our own two seats together on one side of the plane. We had lots of leg room, free wine and liquor, decent food and plenty of movies to pass the time (I finally saw Bohemian Rhapsody). Coming back we were in a row that had more seats, but we still had the extra room, freebies, movies, etc. This flight takes about 10 hours and was one of the best international flights I have experienced in recent years.",2019-06,2019-07-09,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0

The onward aircraft was older and the seat was not a complete sleeper but it was still comfortable. The crew was very pleasant as well. I enjoyed speaking French with them. I would positively recommend this airline. Again despite being a vegetarian I enjoyed the food.

Premium Economy worth it!,Washington DC,Florence,International,"My fiance splurged for the premium economy and it was worth the additional cost.  First value add was being able to check in through Sky Priority, which saved us 30-45 mins as the economy check in line was long and slow moving.  Next you get priority boarding in Zone 1 or 2 which allows you guaranteed room for any carry on bags.  Lastly, the seats were extremely comfortable, plenty of room, and a nice leg rest.  Only caveat is that the seats did not recline, which wasn't that comfortable for falling asleep.  The meal on the flight was honestly as good as you're going to get for being on an airplane.  Air France had a large movie selection which I enjoyed.  We connected through Paris to get to Florence.  Our connected flight was on a normal plane (3 and 3, no premium seating) which was fine as the flight was only 1 1/2 hrs.

Terrible experience,Barcelona,Paris,Europe,"I planned a trip to Paris from Barcelona a year ago. We had just finished a Mediterranean cruise and wanted to spent 3 days in Paris.our flight was delayed 3 hours. After boarding the plane, the captain told us they were waiting for a passenger to arrive. We waited 20 minutes for the passenger and the luggage to be put in the plane. That was when the captain informed us that there were technical difficulties and he was canceling the flight. They made us get into a bus and took us back to the terminal.I stood in line three hours to get to the counter and talk to a representative. During the 3 hours none approached us to see if we had contacted the airline by phone t on get a new ticket or if we needed a hotel. I found out too late about contacting the airline because another passenger told me. I ne er had a flight cancel like this and I did not know. The airfrance employee wanted for us to wait even longer be cause they had to find a hotel for us.We were exhausted and found a hotel on our own and left. Once I got back in the US , I was able to talk to a nice lady from Delta and we got vouchers. What makes me upset is that we did not have to wait in line 3 hours and get a later flight,if only one of the employees had approached us. 3 hours waiting? I know now what unions do to companies.

Great in flight service - horrible ground serivce,Paris,Washington DC,International,"There is no denying that Air France service in the air is good. Having experienced in the past I was looking for this flight. Unfortunately, despite the decent seat, the good food and the decent service the ground service surrounding this flight was poor.

Let's start with the delay of 45 min - we all been there, delays happen. The issue is how you handle them. In this case, poor communication meant that boarding time had gone and passed before any communication was given, after everyone stand in line waiting for a long time. People were cutting the line left and right without rhyme or reason. Finally we were allowed to pass the automatic boarding gates, only to stand in line 10 meter after them for another 30 min.

But the real gem here was the luggage. Somehow they managed to lose the luggage despite the long delay. They do send a proactive text and e-mail about that, for their credit, but in French. Kind of arrogant to think every one speaks French. In any case, it took 4 interactions in the airport (including demanding a supervisor) to actually provide the details for the luggage claim. What followed was a lot of misinformation (wrong time and place for the luggage to arrive), a lot of frustrating with antiquate and not up to date at all website that provide ""status"" of the luggage, long waiting time to speak to a human (hour long) that in the end conclude they really don't know where the luggage is, culminating with 1am delivery as if it i completely normal.

All in all, that left a very sour taste in my mount.",2019-07,2019-07-09,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,4.0

Air travel is now horrible,Paris,Vancouver,International,Stand in line stand in line stand in line. Get into crapy little seat.  Airline lets people get onboard with way too much carry on luggage and purses the size of suit cases and lap top bags and huge head pillows. The food is horrible. The people that line up way to early to board take over head luggage space far from their seat.  Airline staff spend time complaining to each other about pay cuts or crappy working conditions in front of passengers and the airline charges rediculous prices just to choose you seat.  We have the cash for another holiday and there is zero interest to go just so I can send bragging selfies holding a margarita jet lagged pretending like I'm having fun after yet another horrible flight.  I'm staying home and seeing local sites.  If you need a holiday after a holiday ..........to hell with it. Too many hours of hell for a few minutes crowding around some famous site. Pass.

Very impressed,Paris,Halifax,International,"We had originally booked a flight with westjet then got an email saying we had to be switched to airfrance.

Our flight was just about 8 hours long. They provided us with 1 full meal, chicken dinner, potatoes, quinoa salad, dessert, and a cheese wedge. Then came around with basic airplane snacks, and later came around with a small lunch bag with a sandwich, apple wedges and a yogurt drink. When we were seated we were provided with a blanket, head phones and an eye mask for sleeping. Each seat had a table in it with a large selection of movies, TV shows, and games in multiple different languages. Seats leaned back quite far. I checked 2 bags, both with no charge. Only downfall was that there wasn‚Äôt a HUGE amount of leg room.

Travel with Class and Comfort,Paris,San Jose,International,"On Friday 14th June myself and my sister travelled from Paris to San Jose, Costa Rica via Air France on flight AF 430.  

The staff were extremely welcoming, professional and friendly.  They accommodated us throughout the flight with high standards of service.  Upon entering the cabin a staff member took my jacket and placed it on a hanger (corresponding with my seat number) and placed it a cupboard.  This was to prevent me from having to place it on top of my hand luggage in the overhead compartment.

The flight attendants made conversations with us about our upcoming stay in Costa Rica.  They ensured we were comfortable and served us delicious French cuisine onboard.

The Air France business cabin is the most comfortable and practical one I have flown on to date.  Cabins are individually designed in a way that passengers do not have to climb over each others' feet when other passangers have their foot rest down.

I would also like to commend staff on flight AF 475 (Panama City to Paris), for their high standards.

Remind Me Why I'd Ever Want to Fly Air France Again,Miami,Cairo,International,"Air France is code share with Delta; otherwise this never would have happened.

Don't expect to be treated well at all.  You're just cattle, pretty much regardless of class of service.  Air France has a laissez-faire attitude all around about schedule and service by this experience.

Air France CONTINUES to provide top notch service!,Paris,Atlanta,International,"We took Air France on our return trip because it was slightly cheaper than Delta (which has ""fully flat"" seats for business class) since we needed to stay awake for the trip back to the US and did not need to sleep on the overnighter.  It is interesting how the last ten degrees of going from near-flat to fully-flat can affect your ability to sleep significantly (but it does).  I was looking forward to this particular flight because it was the Airbus 380 which is the ""double decker.""  The flight was extremely small to include the landing.  The service was outstanding!

Headphones and remote control are attached to the seat for easy use.  The dopp kit was filled with appropriate items but this one area was where the airline fell short of a competitor (which provided a Tumi branded kit).

Don't fly Air France Joon from Cape Town South Africa  ... find an alternative,Cape Town Central,Paris,International,"My wife and I booked on what we assumed was Air France on a direct flight from Cape Town to Paris. To our surprise we boarded an aircraft with Joon livery which we discovered to our surprise is a ""low cost"" version operated by Air France. The boarding process was chaotic and illogical making one feel like cattle boarding a rail truck.
The cabin staff were casually dressed which was fine but their totally off-hand and casual approach to passengers was less so. Flight instructions were humorous but given the attitude of staff inappropriate. Service was abrupt and unhelpful and it seems that the cabin staff regarded it as doing one a favour to provide food and drinks. Meals were passable but oddly scheduled and no mention was made of the fact that refreshments were available at the rear of the aircraft as evidenced by the fact that at the end of the flight when I sought some water from my wife it was largely untouched. Landing in Paris the aircraft was kept waiting for over an hour before reaching the gate to disembark.

Is Air France antisemitic? I'll say yes,Paris,Tel Aviv,International,"I was using Air France for a business trip to Tokyo. BIG MISTAKE. while the travel to Tokyo was quite ok (no frequent gate changes in Paris, and normal treatment), the way back to Israel was quite different. When I arrived in Paris I had four hours to wait at terminal 2E next to gates K. An hour before boarding I sat next to the gate and waited for it to open. The screen next to the gate stated the boarding was delayed by half an hour, and the flight in the gate across from ours was packed with over 200 people. When I noticed the time of the gate's opening has arrived and the gate didn't open I noticed something was wrong. I hurried to the next gate where Air France employees still stood to ask. To my shock the gate was changed to a gate next to it (not far and not across from it, which indicates this change was totally unnecessary), when I asked the ground crew why there was no announcement and the screen said delay in boarding, the crew didn't address it at all and said we sent one employee to call passengers at the gate (which did not happen since I was seating there). Likely the girl walked three steps from the new gated and yelled for passengers (Totally unprofessional and rude - what if I was completely deaf and not just hard of hearing?). Please note that when I arrived at the new gate the sign still stated boarding (though the crew said it has already been closed). Obviously there was no announcement, and missing passengers where not called at all, just thrown off the flight. This indicated to me a clearly different approach to flights to Israel than the ones I have been on to Japan (missing passengers were announced and searched for in the terminal). When I stated to the girl at the counter that this was a business flight and requested she speaks to my boss to explain to him, she refused saying ""I'm not speaking to anyone"", clearly knowing she's guilty. Than she proceeded to snatch my passport from me and give me a ticket to the next flight. Then she walked off, not explaining what happened to my luggage, and not giving me a hotel voucher (note that I had over 9 hours to wait at the airport). Please mind that I also asked her to find out if she could book me on another flight leaving the airport three hours later from another company and she refused (other companies I traveled with did make the effort to do so). At this point me and another passenger that missed the flight were left in a closed terminal with no way to exist, and no accommodation, as she and two other employees walked off through the crew exist. I managed to contact the officer in charge of the terminal's operations using a technician called for a stuck elevator, who was super helpful and shocked at the Air France crew that left me in the terminal. She then called a hotel for me and walked me out of the terminal using the crew exist. The other passenger was not as lucky as me and slept on the floor in a closed terminal, with no food or water for hours. The next day I was super alert to the sneaky gate changes by Air France, which of course happened again (the gate was again unnecessarily changed to the gate right next to it). There was no announcement about this change either, and the ground crew arrived right at boarding time leaving confused passengers with no one to answer their questions. When they arrived they even approached seated passengers not boarding yet with a claim ""we need to take your bag there is not place on the flight and you can't refuse because the captain said so"". Totally brutal and rude. So is this treatment specifically towards Israeli passengers? YES, I have not experienced any last minute changes and such rude treatment in my flights to Tokyo. Japanese was also used at all times in those flight, but no Hebrew was used for the Israeli flights. Horrible discrimination and antisemitism by the ground crew of Air France lost them future business by my company.",2019-07,2019-07-03,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

"Somewhat Disappointing, Looking Back",Los Angeles,Paris,International,"We took Air France to Paris en route to Athens, our final destination (although we booked through Delta). The 2by2by2 seat arrangement was nice. The entertainment screen was large. Seat was comfortable but a bit tricky to use correctly.

Upon arrival in Paris, we discovered the connecting flight was located quite far away. We did not see AF ground personnel there to assist/advise worried passengers. Long line at border control/passport check heightened our concern of missing flight. Then we were bussed out to plane on tarmac.

Outstanding,Vancouver,Paris,International,It‚Äôs been some years since I‚Äôve travelled overseas but wished a direct flight and Air France‚Äôs departure looked perfect. Wow does 10 hours go quickly on a big comfortable Boeing 777 jet with an attentive crew.

Downright Inconsiderate!,Cincinnati,Paris,International,"In September I flew to Paris with Air France, the flight accommodation and food in business class were exceptional! I happened to leave my shaving bag with my cell phone, medications, prescription glasses and other items including cash in the bag.
I hadn‚Äôt been off the plane for more than 15 minutes when I realized I‚Äôd left my bag on board. I immediately went into the Air France Lounge and reported the mistake too the concierge‚Äôs, they told me there was nothing they could do to help retrieve my bag since the plane had fully deboarded and that I had to file a lost luggage report with Air France and pay $14 to place the add and if it were turned in they would post it on their website. Mind you, the VIP lounge I was in was located less than 1,000 ft from where the plane sat empty.

Worst Flight Experience Ever,Atlanta,Amsterdam,International,"I got a flight cancellation notice within 48 hours of my nonstop departure from ATL to CDG and rebooked on a connection through AMS.  I was told Air France decided to change planes on the nonstop to CDG and since I was flying Business Class, the plane change didn't have enough Business Class seats which prompted them to rebook me on Business via AMS, which got me into Paris 3 hours later than originally scheduled.  But, that wasn't the issue.  At the gate, 60 minutes before departure, Air France told me the flight was overbooked in Business and even though I had a confirmed seat that I paid $9k for, I was going to be sitting in Economy.  Then, to pour salt on the wound, I got a letter from Air France after my trip that I wouldn't receive a fare difference between my Business Class seat and Economy.  Wow.

Missing baggage,Paris,Johannesburg,International,"We connected in Paris from Croatia (via Croatia Airlines). The flight itself was fairly reasonable, there is just limited entertainment on board (especially when compared to other airlines).

When we arrived in JHB, we waited for more than 30 minutes at the carousel before querying at the baggage counter. The person was already aware that our baggage was not on the flight - I feel this is something that they could have notified us on the flight about already.

We were then told that the bags would be delivered to us the next day. The next day we got a call confirming that both our bags were there and that the courier woudl contact us for delivery. The call only came 20:00 to inform us that they would be with us after 21:00. They then arrived with only one bag and no information about the other.

It's better than KLM and Delta with a specific seating area that is divided off once in flight. The food is good but not brilliant and trying to get extra soft drinks and snacks is impossible. That said, I'd choose them again as the seat space is more comfortable and you arrive slightly less dishvelled than on other airlines.

There was a glitch on the flight map which always showed we were still in Dallas. I was very surprised with the size of the lavatory!

Great Flying Experience,Atlanta,Paris,International,"We were very pleased with our business class seating.  Our booking was via Delta in economy comfort and once we arrived at the airport, we requested the Delta agent to upgrade us.  She stated we could do that at the gate.  
The gate agent, (appologies for not writing his name down) was super nice and he upgraded us to business class for $500.00. Furthermore, he was amazingly informative regarding ""how to get to our next destination flight in Paris"". (We were travelling to St Petersburg, Russia.)  Additionally, since we had already upgraded to economy comfort, he provided me with the refund of my upgrade from that class and applied it to my business class.  Thank you so much for being so kind.  Unfortunately, the agent on return trip from Paris to Atlanta at Air France was nice but refused to apply my economy upgrade to my business class cost.  He said ""YOU NEED to apply for a REFUND once you return to USA"".  I thought that was very much "" STICK IT TO THE CUSTOMER ATTITUDE"".  I guess that is to be expected from some people in Paris, somewhat rude.  He was verbally nice but his attitude towards taking care of paying customer not very customer friendly.  (Needless to say, I have'nt applied for the refund yet.)
The flight attendants were super nice, specially coming from Paris to Atlanta on the 18th of May (our seat was 73 G and 73 F, I think, window and aisle on the right side of the plane).  The young lady actually cared for people and always with a great smile serving you regardless of what your requests were.  Furthermore, she even remembered what type of bread/rolls we like.  Thank you for such a wonderful experience.
In business class, the seat reclined all the way so I was able to lay down.  At one point, supposedly there was a turbulence, and I slept right thru it.  
I would highly recommend making a reservation via Delta on international flights since Delta truly takes care of you as do their partners. (I gave a 9 on recommendation due to the not so helpful agent in Paris.)",2019-05,2019-06-29,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

The toilets too were terrible. Doubt I will flight Air France out of Lagos. The final straw is the cheap entertainment screens.In this 21st century, the airline can do better.

Generally good service but inflight entertainment variable,Tokyo,Paris,International,"The flight was very full and the staff were well versed in their drills and service routines. For tall people, it's a bit tough in economy, as on many airlines, due to the limited legroom. The food wasn't as bad as British Airways, but bread rolls alongside pasta or rice are not necessary! Fruit or more vegetables would be great - this is a sign of trying to fill the passengers stomachs with the cheapest options.

Some planes are of the older type, which this one was, and the entertainment system  interface was pretty poor in that the touch screen graphics were too small to press. So it takes a few attempts to select programmes.

One other issue was that the seats are so packed in, that the aisles are very narrow and getting your head banged by passing cabin attendants and other passengers is easy if you're sitting next to them.",2019-06,2019-06-27,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

One strike can spoil everything good,Atlanta,Paris,International,"The plane was an Airbus A-380. We were in Premium Economy on the second floor of the plane. Although there was plenty of leg room, the seats were the MOST UNCOMFORTABLE I have ever sat in on an airplane--as hard as paving stone; I think a park bench would have been more comfortable. In addition to the horrible seats, the food was pretty bad--so much for French cuisine! I don't understand why on a long flight that the passengers can't be served delicious food and have very comfortable seats--especially in Premium Economy.  I might add that on the return flight, we had a different  plane (I think a Boeing) and the seats were very comfortable.  I would also add that on the return we had a very rude steward who insulted us and another passenger.  Very shortly, the head stewardess came to inquire and and then the cabin attendant in command.  Both were extremely polite and inquired from us and the other passenger what had happened. We felt very satisfied with their response and the care about the situation; we never expected this excellent response.

I was pregnant at the time. I then vomited on the plane due to fatigue and almost having a panic attack. Then my luggage didn't arrive at destination, Air France promised to deliver it and never did.

"Outdated entertainment, mixed service",Atlanta,Lyon,International,"I had never flown on an A380 so I was excited to have the change from ATL-CDG.

One even raised his voice several times to multiple passengers for no apparent reason. Food was the only above average aspect and it was only slightly so.

What a surprise when I was told that as our tickets were not bought in the UAE we could not benefit from the service. They explained me at length that those are the company rules.... 
I really do not understand this poor quality of service. With Emirates (only to name one!) no matter where you buy your ticket in France or the UAE you have access to this car service. With Air France apparently this is not the case! They just provide the service in the UAE trying to offer the same service as Emirates but they are failing miserably.

Arrogant airline,Amsterdam,Bangkok,International,"We flew from Amsterdam to Bangkok via Parijs with Air France in business class.
Because our flight from Amsterdam has a delay we had to run in Paris to get our flight, before boarding I askes if our luggage would be on our plane, she said yes they are already at the plane so don‚Äôt worry.
On arrival in Bangkok our luggage was not there, from that moment the circus start
They told us that our luggage was send with Air France to Singapore and onwards to Bangkok, they should arrive late evenning, wrong.
In Paris they put a flightnumber on our tags which doesn‚Äôt excist, so our luggage staid in Singapore, now they maybe arrive the next day with another fligth, which I do hope is the right one.
When you try to call Air France there is a lack of communication, and no one knows where they are or what is going on.
Service on board was poor, overcooked meal, cheap drinks in business class and formal friendly service,  smile when they look at you but as soon as they turn around gone, new plane (787) but cramped seats, only two toilets for 36 people.
This airline is not worth the money you pay for business class, there are better options, so to me it is not strange that it is going not that good with Air France, first things have to solve, get better staff instead of those arrogants, and improve your communication.

Watch out when buying flights on AirFrance but operated by other airlines,Lisbon,Melbourne,International,"We bought a flight from AirFrance to travel between Lisbon and Melbourne via Shanghai, with the Shanghai-Melbourne leg of the flight operated by China Eastern, but sold by AirFrance in the same ticket. 
FIRST CON: when trying to check-in we could no do it for the China Eastern flight, AirFrance explanation at check-in desk, they do not have the systems connected... So we left Lisbon without a boarding pass for the last flight and they had no information where it would be given to us at Lisbon airport... When we got to Shanghai we were given boarding passes for this flight, so this was solved, although not as easily and as well communicated as it should have been.
But it was in Shanghai that the China Eastern flight was delayed for 5 hours. We were stuck in the terminal with no information for 4 hours, then we were boarded and an hour later we were given a meal inside the airplane, still parked in the airport. It was around 1 am when we took off, when we should have departed around 7pm.
SECOND CON: AirFrance customer service, or the inexistente of it. When we tried to complaint about this 5 hour delayed flight AirFrance just told us they had nothing to do with it, it was not operated by them, so we had to deal ourselves with China Eastern, they did not even had the contacts for us to question China Eastern. We were left on our own to make the complain. Even when we asked for an invoice for the flight it was denied, saying I had bought the flight in KLM, even after we showed the email from their site with my reservation.
We have travelled several times before with AirFrance, in flight operated by them or by KLM, buying the tickets online, checking in online, and no complains until now.

Would not provide any information as to why it was Void or why there was no notice given about the fact that it was Void.  I asked them to check to see if perhaps there was a problem with the booking number and to do a check on the flight for the names, and they would not and said to contact someone else.  Everyone said it was an issue with AirFrance, but they were being very unhelpful and not responding.  I was in communication with the booking agent, and they were contacting both airlines as well.  After a number of calls to both airlines, it was determined that the first flight was Void, no notification given, but it was reissued with a new reservation number, no notification given, and it was eventually located through the names and the new confirmation number provided.  Four hours of time on hold on the phone and four hours of online chat with various people, stressed out, and feeling helpless and at a loss what to do.  I am grateful for the diligence of the booking agent who went through a lot of effort for what should have been a simple check.  Will not be booking with Joon/Air France again if I have the option",2019-06,2019-06-24,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,1.0,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

Too much of the difference within the service attitude among flight attendants,Paris,Pointe-a-Pitre,International,"We flew with Norwegian from Finland to Paris, after a stay-over continued to Guapeloupe. Stayed  on Caribbean 12 nights, then same route back to FInland. We were a group of 8. Liked the plain, enough legroom, in-flight enterntainment average.  The food was without a doubt the worse in-flight meal ever,especially inbound flight PTP-ORY!!Smooth flight experience overall except what comes to cabin crew service attitude.
There were sweet and smiley, helpful attendants but there were few who'd probably be better off working somewhere else. Talking to each other, ignoring the passengers, no smiles. BUT...the best part was when I tried to return to my seat from the toilet. There was a big man in front of me and we were trying to pass one another smiling and talking friendly to each other ( I speak also French). There was one ""not-so-happy"" attendant behind that man mumbling herself ,rolling her eyes that ""oh la la la la LA LAAAA!"" We were bothering her work as she had to wait 5 seconds us solving the ""problem"". And that bodylanguage..... I don't know if this is a small thing or deal breaker for you fellow-passengers, but for me it was, I am ALL for customers as they pay our salaries. I've been as an exchange student in France when I was in high school so I know how dramatic French can be, but not suitable anymore in year 2019 in customer service. I used to work for holiday and business travel industry from 1985 to 2004. I have flown in all classes with more than 60 airlines-also Air France-, but how we are served as a customer should never make the client feel unwanted regardless what your class is. Now just few people gave bad feelings, but that will come into my mind when thinking of these AF flighs. I still fly but not as a travel agent, only as a passionate traveller. Where ever we all work, there is/are always customer -s who pay our pay checks, am I right? Treat them like you want to be treated, so they come back again and again.
Oh, and the check in-desk at Orly employees were as rude as always in Paris, that'll never change :D",2019-05,2019-06-24,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0

Older Plane but Better Than Most,Paris,Atlanta,International,"This was a Boeing 777. It doesn‚Äôt have the pods that many airlines are adopting and the seats do not lay flat.

Be careful as stuff can easily fall behind the seat and it is difficult to retrieve. As for entertainment there is plenty in English and French. I think this plane is in need of a refurb and find Deltas planes more comfortable. The food is better on Air France, but expect some typical French dishes like duck pate. You won‚Äôt be unhappy but it could be better. Also, check bulkhead seats if you don‚Äôt want them. For example, row 5 is also bulkhead.",2019-06,2019-06-23,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0

Once Upon a Time,Washington DC,Paris,International,"Once upon a time, Air France was the creme de la creme. How did it become skim milk? Just 20 years ago, my wife and I would fly Air France and feel like we were in the lap of luxury, wishing for as much on Delta, where I had elite status. Now Delta looks and feels like an upgrade. Even eight years ago, we took AF 55 to Paris (and the return), and we were wowed. That almost new A380 was the most comfortable plane we‚Äôd ever experienced.

Over the past two weeks, we took the same two flights on the same airline and same aircraft. What a disappointment. I‚Äôm relatively certain we flew on the same upholstery, watched the same screens, and used the same toilets that we did nearly a decade ago. This craft showed (and smelled) it‚Äôs age, and it was obvious that Air France had become a budget carrier. The food, wine, and everything else about the experience confirmed the worst: Air France has become the Spirit Air of international carriers. To top it off, both flights were late, the boarding process a disorganized mess.

At least the price was right.

Cancellation - When having a difficult pregnancy isn't considered,Paris,Tokyo,International,"We have been planning with my fiance to go to Japan for few years and we finally decided to go this year. Then beautiful surprise, I find out that I am pregnant before travelling. At the beginning, I was still ok and excited to go there. Then, I started to feel very bad and I am currently experiencing Hyperemesis Gravidarum which is extreme sickness and the incapability to move and go out (especially in the light). So the trip has to be cancelled. I had no option for reimbursement just modification for the date but in regards to my situation I thought they could be understanding (even postponing the trip couldn't be possible for at least few months). I phoned twice the customer service to be sure and they kindly asked me to fiil a form and add the certificates and sick note. 
But second surprise : without explanation they just reimburse 70 euros over the 1100euros I paid for the flight. Even my fianc√© with the same situation (but no sickness) had a credit but with BRITISH AIRLINES. 
And before that, for another situation, UNITED offered me a credit considering I am a frequent flyer.

Tired aircraft,Paris,Miami,International,"We flew back on June 9th from Paris to Miami, on probably one of the worse flights I've been on. After a frustrating transfer from our Venice flight, we had to go from 2F to 2E. In theory that sounds simple enough and we had 2 hours. The nightmare started at Immigration. You have to go through and immigration check before being let in to that terminal. It was a sea of people and there were just a few immigration officers. There must of been 600 people trying to get through. By the time we finally did, our flight to Miami was boarding. We didn't have time to pick up anything for the flight to Miami to snack on. Which, I highly recommend. The food they served was really bad and flavorless. The seat was the worse Id been in. I was in 20A on a very old 777. The window wasn't alligned with the seat so you didn't have any wiggle room for your shoulder. The leg room was really poor. There was a metal bar at my feet that was used for the seat in front of me for some reason, so i had to put my left foot between the wall of the plane and this metal bar/seat support. I literally couldn't move. The seating configuration is 10 across and it's so miserable, I can't tell you how bad it was. There's no overhead personal air vents, so you are at the mercy of the cabin temp not being able to be comfortable. The plane was really hot. I did ask twice for them to turn the AC on but that went on deaf ears. By the time we got to Miami I was in such pain for being cramped, it was hard to get up from the seat. We had even purchased these seats in hopes of having the middle open for some extra room but the flight was full, and not an empty seat. The person in front of me kept moving his seat throughout the flight so watching the TV was frustrating. Once he put his seat back, that ended any comfort i did have. Couldn't even utilize the tray for the entree that came. We had flown this flight due to the fare, we flew Delta over which was nice, and their coach was comfortable. I will never ever take an air france flight over the water again. Service was just horrible, plane was horrible. They did have a good selection of in flight entertainment.

Air France and the whole Charles de Gaulle thing....,Paris,Dakar,International,"As Air France has a monopoly on flights to francophone West Africa, I‚Äôve been travelling a lot with them recently. This flight was typical; a much improved experience from a few years ago. Planes are modern airbuses with comfortable seating. Most of the flights I‚Äôve been have been similar to this one; leaving late but landing on schedule. 

The entertainment system is extensive. Content is not at all geared towards a diet of tiresome American block busters. It‚Äôs refreshing to be given the option of seeing some European movies. The food and wine is excellent, although some of the frou frou fripperies may be lost in transit. An Amuse Bouche loses its impact at 37,000 feet as it is difficult to amuse anyone‚Äôs bouche in an environment where strong base flavours are needed. The service is crisp and efficient allowing you to work or snooze; something BA for instance really need to re-learn. The toiletries bag provided is better quality is the norm. 

The whole CDG thing......

It has been noticeable for twenty years that the rudeness the French were once reknown for has disappeared. Everywhere you go, you are often met with pleasing, professional and polite service. Those providing it are gracious and personable and slip seamlessly into flawless English. I sometimes wonder if we are  being lulled into a false sense of security and we are currently in some kind of sweet spot between the French correcting our woefully poor French grammar and the French starting to correct our jarringly poor English language skills. 

My theory is the irreducible hard core of rudeness has been rounded-up by the relevant authorities and sent to work in CDG.

These refuseniks do not acknowledge any other foreign languages. Indifference is the default setting. Gallic shrugs sweep through the airport like a Mexican wave. Disinterested staff also stand around the duty free stalls. These emporia blink like an oligarchs drinks cabinet, they sell little of use and what there is is eye watering over priced. 

The airport is positively Byzantine and a nightmare to navigate. Even when travelling within schengen security has to be faced a second time. Nothing less than two hours is required for a transfer at CDG. 

On arrival at CDG after an over night flight, red rimmed eyes and sleep bereft minds are hit by a visual cacophony of competing singnage with a hierarchy of terminals, portes and gates to contend with. Not to mention the added fun of banks of escalators and an intra-terminal train to negotiate.",2019-06,2019-06-19,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

Confusion About Gates...,Paris,Athens,Europe,"We were connecting to this Air France flight in Paris and it was going to be a tight connection. At our arriving gate we were met by Air France staff and given the number of the gate we needed to get to. Once we got to that gate and waited in the line we found it was NOT the correct gate and had to run...some how it had changed in those first 20 minutes...just a little stressful. Fortunately, the flight was leaving late. The staff was a little less helpful on this flight and my tray was a sticky mess when I had to put it down.

Lackadaisical attitude of staff but overall a good flight,Mumbai,Paris,International,"This for Joon by Air France
Ups:
Good legroom 
good entertainment
clean loos 
loved the snack presentation 

Downs:
- champagne on the menu, but they never serve it to you. You ask , they say its for the next service and in the next service they say no alcohol. And yes between services they don't serve alcohol which is fair but they are clear in their behaviour that they don't want to serve you alcohol. Because I asked for beer instead of champagne but they deferred it saying they will serve after service but they never did. I think they should just take alcohol off their amenities. 
- after a 45 minute queue , they make you wait saying they are overbooked and make you wait for another 10 minutes.",2019-06,2019-06-18,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,4.0
Worst Airline we have flown with,London,Mahebourg,International,"Our holiday was booked with Virgin Holidays but they farmed us out the Air France. Heathrow to Paris with plane change to carry on to Mauritius. The safety on this airline was disgusting. It was done on screen and the crew walked up and down aisles but never told people to fasten seat belts, put seat and trays upright or turn off electronic devices. People separated from members of their party were allowed to move together to no note of these moves were noted and there was a lot of change of seating. Arriving in Paris we did not expect to have to go through all the security and passport control again and staff here were very slow, rude and very unhelpful when we were trying to find out were we needed to go.

Great flights and service.,San Francisco,Paris,International,"Used Air France economy from SFO to CDG and business class on the way back. Overall, we were very impressed with the entire trip. Check in was quick and easy. Boarding was quick and organized. While the leg space was decent, the economy seats were hard and uncomfortable for a 10 hour flight. My back was actually hurting by the time we got to Paris. But in my experience, the seats were not any worse than most airlines. Service was amazing. Very professional, friendly and attentive. Food was also good. I actually enjoyed the meal and found it very tasty. Return in business class was a great treat. While it was my first time flying business class and have nothing to compare it to, it was an amazing experience. The meals and service were outstanding. The seat were super comfortable with tons of leg room and fully recline into a bed. It made the 10 hour flight back go so quickly.

"Monitor Inoperative, Reneged on Compensation, Late Flight, Late Luggage",Washington DC,Paris,International,"An inoperative monitor is usually not a tragedy but for a nearly 8 hour flight, it was still quite aggravating (besides failing requirement to provide mandatory safety briefing).

When reset did not fix my monitor, the purser offered a credit for tax-free purchase as compensation but then he did not follow up. When I asked again later he said it was too late.

Trip to Europe,Atlanta,Paris,International,"We purchased our tickets on January 1, 2019, for our trip on May 8, 2019, on May 7, 2019, at night we received a text from Air France telling us that the seats that we reserved were not available and that we were bumped to regular economy.  We called Delta as our tickets were purchased thru Delta and Delta said that everything was fine and provided us with new seat numbers in the original class that was booked.  On May 8, 2019, morning we received a text from Air France telling that our 8:00 pm flight was canceled, again we called Delta which told us that they could not understand what was going on as their computer was showing that our flight was scheduled departing on time, after being put on hold, the Delta representative told us that after checking with Air France that our flight was canceled and they were booking us on the 4:30 pm Air France flight that day.  At that time it was already near noon so we rushed to the airport to try to figure out what seats we would have, we had to go to the counter at the gate to find out that we were seated together in Economy at the end of the plane.  The good part: We left on the same day as we had car and hotel reservations the next day, the service onboard Air France was very good, the Delta representatives were very helpful and tried to do the best they could.  The bad part:  So much confusion and misinformation from Air France which makes us feel that to be Elite flyer with Delta does mean much for Air France.

After moving a few counters, met some very professional, helpful and courteous staff, who advised that I should contact the ticketing centre ASAP. Later, got a Boarding Pass after paying 250 Euros with a standby status for the seat. Later the staff provided me with a seat towards the end of the boarding as the flight was fully booked.

Most uncomfortable seats of any airline.,Athens,Detroit,International,"Flew Air France from Athens to Paris then Paris to Detroit. On Athens to Paris run, our seats would not recline. No audio or video to watch ( a 3 1/2 hour flight). From Paris to Detroit, upgraded to Air France Preferred seats - I could not find any Premium Economy seats on their website - these were the only options available. When we got on the plane we find that they are nothing but coach seats, just closer to the front of the plane. Big deal. No legroom and narrow seat width. These seats were rock hard. - no padding. Both my wife and I were squirming through the whole flight. My butt was so sore as was my back. We both had to get up twice to go stand at the back of the plane as did many others.

Worse experience,Montreal,Paris,International,"Everything was going fine until we landed to Paris. From there our nightmare started. The original flight from Montreal to Paris had about 35 minutes late so we couldn't make it to our next flight to Mulhouse planned for 9h15am. At this point we were offered to take the next flight at 12pm by following a very complicated procedure (find a way to transfer our luggage and get to Orly airport). After talking to 3 different employees, nobody could confirm what was happening with the luggage transfer and everyone had a different version. Also we found out that it takes about 1 hour to get to Orly so we couldn't catch that flight. Long story short we took the next flight to Mulhouse at 9h55pm and waisted the whole day at the airport (13 hours).

Scum. Air France not announcing a flight boarding and then not allowing you to board the plane.,Toulouse,Paris,Domestic,"Toulouse airport. I am a good member, so I was in the lounge with my daughter. We were observing the screen all the time to check our flight status. The boarding of our flight to Paris Orly af6131 was not displayed on the screen until 15:42, and none of the crue members gave us a sign that we had to go to the gate. When finally the boarding was displayed on the screen we went directly to the gate, and just in from of us the date was closed by a team member who saw us approaching the gate (literally 5 seconds before we arrived). I was begging them to let us pass (thought it wasn‚Äôt even my fault that the boarding wasn‚Äôt announced). I was crying and asking for a solution for me and my daughter, but they simply kicked me off by saying that I have to find a solution myself at their sales deck (of course for my money). It is outrageous behaviour and the way they treat their clients by: 
1. Not announcing the flight boarding properly in the zones of the airport
2. By announcing the boarding last call at the last moment, and still when you arrive they are closing the doors just in front of you 
3. By not trying to help and find any solutions for their loyal clients (I am good) 

Simply I am sure it is the way airfrahce is trying to gain more money, it‚Äôs a real scum, when they don‚Äôt announce the flight and then you have to pay from your pocket to buy a new ticket.

"Totally professional, courteous and interested",Vancouver,Paris,International,We also returned from Europe with Air France but the trip over was our first experience with the airline. Terrific trip. The staff were so very courteous and giving for small requests like an extra pillow for instance. Food was great but it seemed to us that the seating had more space than other international airlines. Loads of carry on space as well and not the usual - give us your carry on bags for the hold please - routine while boarding. We will certainly go Air France again.

A Great Flight,Paris,San Francisco,International,Air France does an outstanding job with its Business Class on Transatlantic flights.  It is notable that the food is somewhat better flying from Paris - presumably because it comes from a French catering kitchen.

"Filthy Business Class cabin, but genteel cabin crew",Paris,San Francisco,International,"As I approached my Business Class seat at initial boarding, I was appalled at the food remnants on the carpet as well as all across my seat.  This, in addition to large grease stains on the seat upholstery.  I pointed the filth out to the cabin attendant who then dusted the crumbs from the seat onto the floor.  For 20 minutes thereafter, she tried to find a clean seat-cover, but came back with some ""replacements"" that were equally filthy.  Ultimately, she suggested a change of seat cushion from an unoccupied seat.  The purser came to me a few minutes later and told me that he would make a written report about the filth, and that Air France's corporate office would be in touch with me.  It is now one week since that promise.  I have not heard a word from anybody at Air France.  Do they believe that Business Class passengers who pay a surcharge for, among other things, a certain level of cleanliness deserve filth in the cabin and filth in the bathroom, especially on a long trans-continental flight?",2019-06,2019-06-07,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,3.0

Customers were agitated, making matter worse.  Four hours after the plane dropped us at the airport I was on my way to an hotel for the night.

The seats were good, but as a tall guy at 189cm, I never really sit 100% comfortable in these seats. The infotainment headphones that comes in PE was really good!

I said I was there to pick up my bag that had been lost. She said she couldn‚Äôt help me that it was after 10pm. I said I didn‚Äôt know there was a time they closed, that no one shared that with me when they called to let me know the bag they lost was now found. She got very rude, would not give me her name.

Constant delays. Had to rebook connections twice in one trip.,Washington DC,Madrid,International,"My experience with Air France has been abysmal. Both going to and coming home from the destination, my initial flights have been delayed, causing me to miss all connections. And while Air France will rebook the flights and provide lodging in the mean time, it has still cost me upwards of $600 in cancelled hotel rooms, missed train connections, and other delay-related costs. The hotel room they provide for overnight delays/rebooking is spartan to put it nicely--it's more of a dorm room with a soap dispenser and no amenities, even limited plugs.

Customer Service Non-Existent,Paris,Nice,Domestic,"Walk into Charles de Gaualle Airport happy to enjoy our vacation and within 30 minutes of trying to check-in I‚Äôm seriously ready to cancel the entire vacation and go back to the US.  

Starting point, check-in Kiosk asks which language, English is my response.  We get to baggage and I need to add an additional bag for a fee.  It forgets I only speak English and starts asking me for payment in French.

Get past that issue, then I get a receipt for my payment and bag tags.  No boarding pass.  I go to an AirFrance Employee in the area and they just waived their hands and walked away.  I go back to the Kiosk and try again.  Same thing duplicate bag tags and no boarding pass.  Time is passing and I need to get moving.  I find another AirFrance Employee and they send me to Check-in area 7 to  speak with a representative.  I go to area 7 and the AirFrance Employee tells me to go to Area 5.  I go to Area 5 and the Employee tells me to go to Area 7.  I inform her that I was sent by her Co-Worker at 7 to come to 5.  She then tells there is nothing she can do.  

As I walk away angry and confused in this strange country I find another AirFrance Employee between Area 5 and 4 who helps me by printing some boarding passes.  

I now go to check my bags in and I‚Äôm told to scan my boarding pass which I try to only to find out that it does not work.  

I now have to find another AirFrance Employee to get over that issue.  She informs me that scanner must be broken even though it‚Äôs not marked or showing any evidence of not working. 

I insist she stay with me until my bags are checked into their system.  We finally get that completed and are ready to go to the gate but my wife is crying because of this chaos and I‚Äôm not a happy camper either.  So our vacation went from Happy to get me the heck out of this country.

I‚Äôm not a rookie traveler as I have over a million miles on American and a Platinum Executive Status holder.

First time flying Air France - love the app but the flight was just okay,Atlanta,Paris,International,"This was our first time flying with Air France and I had high hopes for our 8 and a half hour flight to Paris from Atlanta. First let me just say, the Air France kiosk (partnered with Delta) we checked our bags in with at Atlanta is lacking when it comes to anything resembling customer service.

A quick flight but not well organised,Paris,Florence,Europe,This was a quick flight between Paris and Florence Italy.  We were advised that the flight was fully booked and hand luggage should be kept to a minimum and we are asked the check-in some hand luggage to help.  I did so but notice that many passengers came on board with 2 or even 3 bags as hand luggage.  Some bags were almost too big for the overhead lockers.

Time to replace Business Class Seats. Really!,Paris,Mexico City,International,"Just returned to Mexico City on an Air France flight from Paris. Business Class.

Nightmarish lost and found process,Paris,Bordeaux,Domestic,"Part of an airline's customer service duty is to operate a lost and found.  Air France has avoided that duty, and externalized the cost and time involved, by 
contracting out its lost and found service to a business called France Objets Trouves.     Even though Air France employees find the items, you cannot claim them through Air France, and you cannot contact Air France about your items.  You cannot call or email this business, you can only make a claim on the website, and then they email you, but as a ""do not reply"" email.  They do not have a public phone number. 
The website doesn't work reliably on mobile devices (which is what travelers would  often be using) getting people into nonsensical loops, such as saying the claim has  posted, and then another screen saying it has not.  It requires you choose a subcategory of the lost item, but the only subcategories of ""travel documents"" are ""post card"" and ""maps.""  No category for passport, which is what I lost.  The site states there is a fee for the service, but there is no screen or  link to pay the fee.  
The inability to reach the company and to confirm that I could get my lost item put a damper on my trip.  My tour leader and I each spent hours trying to deal with this, and trying other ways to reach Air France, but it was impossible.
Finally I got back to the airport and tried to go to the address where the email said I could retrieve my item, and neither the taxi drivers in line, nor the dispatcher, knew where this address was.   If my tour leader hadn't gone with me and insisted, in French, that he knew where it was, I don't think they would have taken me there, and I would be stranded, a few kilometers from my passport, but with no way to get there. 
The place itself, when I got there, was Kafkaesque--you go in this secure building which is a lot like a prison entrance, the guards don't know anything about the procedure, and you just wait till someone comes. 
It was a very stressful and expensive experience, and none of it was necessary.  
Air France should sever its ties with this company, and go back to providing accessible lost and found services to its passengers.",2019-05,2019-06-01,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

"Amazing flight, but make sure your carry-on is SMALLER than requirements",Paris,Boston,International,"As always, the Air France flight experience was flawless. Friendly staff, good meals, wine with dinner, great entertainment options. We love Air France and fly it whenever possible. Our only hiccup (and this is the first time we had this issue) was with our carry on bags. We bought them several years ago specifically because they fit Air France's requirements. We've flown with them dozens of times, and there has never been a problem. We're always careful about weight, and of course the size is fine. However on this flight we were pulled aside, and when the baggage-size attendant put my bag in the measuring guide, he put it in at a slant so of course it didn't settle in evenly. He told me it was too big. I readjusted the bag and slid it in, but he still said it was no good. We could have argued it but didn't want to be ""those"" Americans, so we paid our 50 euros and checked the bag. It was truly annoying, especially since this has never been a problem before. It's left a bad taste in my mouth and now I'm concerned about my next flight on Air France.",2019-05,2019-05-31,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,5.0

We knew what we were going to get,London,Antananarivo,International,"We've used Air France once before and weren't impressed then.  But this route had limited options so we had little choice.  The check in line at Heathrow was very long and they seemed to open late.  The plane and the toilets were very clean all the way, both ways.  However, the cabin is from the dark ages.   4 inch screens, pull out control, no USB, difficult to view films and fast forward or reverse etc.   The food out to Madagascar was OK, the food on our return was pretty poor.   As we've experienced before, the only drink service you will get is prior to a meal service.   Other than that, it's up to you to get your own from the back of the cabin.  On board service is pretty poor and not what you'd expect from a national carrier.  And Paris CdG is dreadful.  They cancelled our connection back to London (we did have more than 2 weeks notice) and put us on a later flight.  So after an 11 hour overnight flight, we had a 5 hour wait in Paris CdG.  The only food outlets they have are a sushi bar, a caviar bar, a bakery, a starbucks and a pret.   There is no where to get a proper meal.    And Air France have refused to give compensation or vouchers for any food even though they told us when the flight was changed, and at the transfer desk on arrival in Paris CdG, that we should claim on our return.

The plane was an Airbus A380 which seats 516 people, it has two floors of seating and is one amazing and huge plane.  The service on Air France was wonderful, snacks, your choice of two entrees for dinner in economy, champagne, wine, etc.  Entertainment system was very nice with a very large selection of fairly recent movies plus games, music, tv shows, etc.  Another nice feature was the ability to get out of your seat and help yourself to drinks, and snacks during the flight.  The flight itself was smooth with excellect take off and landing.  My only complaint was the scheduling of connections.  We flew from Rome to Paris on Air France and the time between connections was only a little more than an hour which is impossible to make when you have to go from Gate A to Gate M and going to passport control.  The lines were very long and thank goodness the flight was delayed (I think for the people making connections).

Making a terrible experience into a more pleasant one,Paris,Tbilisi,Europe,"I feel compelled to write a review for Air France because I had a surprisingly stellar experience despite an overall horrific travel experience. I had booked my initial travel on business class on Polish Airlines from Los Angeles to Tblisi Georgia since it was the shortest flight in the duration of 18.5 total. It was on May 3th, 2019. By the time I got to Warsaw and waited for 6 hours that was expected, then there were delays, then unexpectedly they cancelled the flight at the last moment and informed us that we needed to wait for another 24 hours to fly to Tbilisi. They did provide a hotel. However, I had a family waiting for me for a celebration and I needed to get to Tbilisi as soon as possible. So, I arranged an arduous fight back to Paris, then to Tbilisi that saved more time. My overall flight lasted 37 hours and included lots of schlepping, but I have to mention the detour through Air France that provided light and amazing service through this ordeal. The flight to Paris included this delightful female (unfortunately I didn‚Äôt get her name) flight attendant that made things so pleasant. From Paris to Tblisi, on the last exhausting leg, I encountered a flight attendant named Patrick Purser, who not only made my day pleasant, but on a deeper level provided comfort and enlightenment. I know, it sounds corny, but I can not undermine how he changed my horrific flight experience to quite pleasant. He was authentic, didn‚Äôt try too hard, even expressed that he didn‚Äôt want to work that day, but he was happy to be there. Flight attendants like Patrick make the real difference with their humility and hard work. I hope he hears about this and knows that his job, as difficult as it is, makes a difference in people‚Äôs lives. He is fantastic and deserves accolades.  Flight attendants have a difficult job of dealing with stressed public. I am not sure if they get paid well.

Will Never Use Them Again!!!!!!!!,Atlanta,Athens,International,"Your message:.

We were not given seats after the first flight was changed-Air France wanted us to take a much longer flight for the same price, so I changed what they offered after the cancellation to a more acceptable time . My daughter and I were not given seats together for the long flight over the ocean. On the return flight, If I had wanted a longer layover, I would have paid the cheaper price. It was just a fiasco all around. Our flight was then delayed an hour due to mechanical failure. On the flight coming home was also changed, and instead of an hour and a half layover, we got to spend almost 5 hours in the Paris airport.  As our plane was boarding, they stopped the procedure and we waited for an hour in line, until it continued. The plane was a double decker, and it was a minimum of three hours before he came by to offer us drinks.Our seats were against the bathroom. We heard this loud noise every time someone went to the restroom.

Premium Economy vs Business Class,Houston,Barcelona,International,"Recently took a trip from IAH to BCN via CDG. On the way there, I was in Premium Economy. I had previously read some pretty scathing reviews about the seats in premium economy - mainly about how they don't actually recline, but instead the seat scoots forward to give the illusion of reclining. I personally can't sleep on planes, even in regular economy, so the seat didn't really make much difference to me. What I really enjoyed about premium economy was that you get your own space, your own shell, where you're not encroaching on the space of the person next to you. To me, this is a great perk and worth the price of the ticket. 

On the way back, I upgraded to Business Class as the pay upgrade was pretty cheap. This was my first time flying in business so I have nothing to compare it to, but I found everything to be satisfactory. The flight attendants were friendly and attentive. The in-flight entertain system (in both PE and BC) are very good - lots of of good movie selections, and you get the same noise-canceling headphones in both cabins. The food in both cabins was also very good, with obviously business class having the better options.

The row we were seated in was close to the galley; however, our row and the one in front of us repeatedly was skipped over when the attendants were passing out drinks etc. When we said something the crew was very snippy like we were lying that the woman skipped our rows and stopped serving entirely without returning. The crew was extremely unorganized and seemed flustered throughout the journey. So if this was my only experience with Air France, I might think twice about flying with them again. BUT on the return flight the crew was wonderful. The crew was friendly, organized, and made sure passengers got enough to drink and were very attentive. So in all I would definitely fly Air France again and hope the bad experience I had will not repeat int he future.",2019-05,2019-05-27,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0
Flight from hell,Paris,Mahebourg,International,"Seat pitch on the Boeing 777 was too narrow for me at 6 foot 2 inches tall and an 11 hour flight, I was in agony by the time we arrived Mauritius. We expected being Air France the food would be good, it was terrible. The in-flight entertainment system didn't work properly and actually stopped working half way through the flight.
During the holiday our tour rep contacted Air France booking requesting extra leg room seats for our return journey, which I was more than willing to pay for. The booking clerk moved us to the rear two seat of the a/c insisting they were extra leg room - They weren't. My only comfort on the return leg was watching the passenger in front of me snap his entertainment screen off from the seat in front when he went to adjust it - The dinner was dry and overcooked - we refused the breakfast.
I have worked in the aircraft industry for over 21 years and understand the 777 is an old a/c so equipment does fail, but I cannot forgive the booking clerk for her ineptitude and will not fly Air France again on any a/c after the terrible food they served.",2019-04,2019-05-27,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0

Terrible experience with ticket refund,Rome,Paris,Europe,"Ticket refund with this airline was a major pain and in the end they didn't give me a refund.

It went like this: I booked a flight from Rome to Paris for this coming summer. When I tried to cancel it the next day, I first called the customer support. The lady on the phone told me that I would only need to file a ticket refund request online, because the airline has a 24 hours refund policy called ""Customer First Program"", so I did that. All these happened within 24 hours of ticket purchase.

The rest of the story? I never got an email confirmation after submitting the online request. I tried to contact them a day later. First I got a response saying that I should have filed the ticket refund request on air France Italy's website, not air France America's website. I told them the first lady never mentioned that, and the website never mentioned that either and even worse I never got an email confirmation.

Crews partying,Bangkok,Paris,International,"I am looking to find other passenger on the same flight as me 5th May 2019.

I believe the 2 members of crew serving me to both be drunk as one fell on me 5 times and the other kept stepping on my feet. It also seemed that friends of the crew where upstairs on the 777 in the crew area only coming down for drink or the run round the plane. I dread to think what would have happened in an emergency.

Delta was quite generous , with snacks available at all times.

Good food.,San Francisco,Paris,International,"The French are always good at food, and  Air France lived up to the expectations.  It shows that you can serve high quality wine and food at 38000 feet if you try.  

The rest of the experience was only so-so, with two stand-out issues:

The boarding of the A380 at San Francisco was diabolically bad.  The flight shared a downstairs boarding area with a Cathay 777 that was loading at the same time.  It was an unbelievable mess.  The lounge only has room for half the passengers that were crammed in there.  The entire room was standing room only shoulder to shoulder.  I am actually surprised it didn't violate fire regulations it was that crowded.  Not a business class experience at all.  This issue is so bad I will not fly them again until it is fixed.

The other issue was noise.  The A380 is a nice quiet aircraft, but the noise came from the galley which we were about 3 rows from.  After dinner as we were settling down to get some sleep on this overnight flight,  there came a continuous crashing and banging of the cleanup after dinner.   Several times whole piles of plates fell to the floor.   The metal boxes were roughly being slammed into the storage slots.   Doors were being slammed shut.  This racket went on for at least an hour it seemed.  

It seems to me that the whole design of aircraft galleys has not changed in  50 years.  Since you have to pass this area when boarding surely they could be made nicer looking and made of quieter materials?   And why can't the doors on cupboards close quietly?   They should borrow from modern kitchen design.

So bottom-line:  Great food, but the boarding space (at least at SFO) needs fixing and the galley modernized and made a lot quieter.",2019-05,2019-05-25,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,5.0
Beware Carry on Weight Issues,Paris,Toronto,International,"I'm a frequent flyer between Toronto and Paris.  Usually have the option of using Air France or Air Canada, dependent on price. Opted to fly Air France carry on..  Proceeded to security after check in at CDG only to be pulled aside to weigh my carry on which came in under the limit at 11.4 kg.  Unbeknown to me Air France considers your personal item AND carry on for a total weight.  I've never had this on any other airline and more importantly this was NOT an issue on my flight over.  My personal item was similar in size to a woman's purse or small knapsack and easily fits under the seat.  Just seems like a money grab (‚Ç¨50 extra cost and required checking in the bag)!  A second gripe was the meal or lack of it.  The couple beside me opted for special meals and I was fully skipped over.  Requested a meal after I was aware of the issue and told that it was unavailable.  Not a big problem for me but really just a lack of consideration on the flight service crews part.

Seattle to Paris and Back A330-200,Seattle,Paris,International,"Horrible representation of Air France.  The cabin is circa 1985 on these planes.  The seat is not lie-flat, the screen is tiny and actually a tad blurry, the cabin is also very worn and tired.  I would choose any other airline than Air France for this route.  We have friends who are extreme world travelers and they recently flew the Air France 777ER on a long haul and they rated it the best flight cabin (new) they've ever flown.  Air France was supposed to switch in a refurbished plane on this rout by now but it's still like riding in the back of an old NY cab.  Flight crew was outstanding!

odd flight,Paris,Prague,Europe,"So in some ways, this was a more comfortable flight than our trip from LAX to Paris.  The seats seemed to be more comfortable, and given that there weren't as many people on this flight, there was less of the usual scrum to get on and get a space for one's carry-on.

The odd thing was that this turned into the party bus from Paris to Prague.  A group of men, including one guy dressed in women's clothes and a woman's wig, started drinking as soon as the beverage cart got wheeled out, and they kept going hard at it for the duration of the flight, getting louder as we went along.  No one appeared overly excited at this, so we just rolled with it.

Given that we saw similar groups of guys (including the obligatory guy in a dress and wig) all over Prague, we got the idea that maybe Prague is kinda the Vegas of Central Europe, but really, I'm clueless as to what was going on.

Anyway, aside from that, the flight was fine.  After the endless hike that is Charles de Gaulle, the Prague airport was a breeze to navigate and get out of.",2019-05,2019-05-21,4.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
OK flight,Los Angeles,Paris,International,"Not a whole lot to report about this flight.  We boarded on time, and flight took off more or less on time, and we got to Paris with enough time to get to our connecting flight to Prague.  They initially had problems with the seat-back video monitors, but were eventually able to reboot the system and get it working, except for my monitor, which never came on through the entire flight.  Not a big deal for me, as I mostly read, or slept, but if I'd been counting on being able to keep myself busy with movies or TV shows, I'd probably have been an unhappy camper.  

Food on flight was OK, nothing to write home about.  Cabin attendants were also OK.  Bottom line is that I really don't expect much these days from the airlines, whether I'm flying domestic international; they've all turned flying into the equivalent of being on a Greyhound bus, albeit at 30K feet.  If they get me to my destination in one piece and more or less on time, I'm a satisfied customer.",2019-05,2019-05-21,4.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0
Lost my bag and 30 other people‚Äôs.,Paris,Seattle,International,"I had a horrible experience with Air France. Arrived at SeaTac airport in Seattle after a trip to Stockholm & Paris. During this trip I made my way to Champagne France as I am in the wine industry. I purchased several wines only available in this region. Upon my DIRECT flight back to Seattle, my bag didn‚Äôt arrive. I filed a claim at the counter the gentleman was poised however not exactly helpful. He stated that he located my bag in Paris and would have it to me the next day at noon. However days went by I had to continue reaching out. Wasting my time, sometimes sitting on hold up to an hour and a half or more. No apology from anyone until about the 5th day. Not even from an Air France employee. It was Delta. The Airfrance employees didn‚Äôt apologize nor offer any assistance. My wine I had packed sat in ATL until it‚Äôs arrival in Seattle. My wine was spoiled :(. I had several employees lie to me and give me misinformation. At one point an employee even said cargo is more important that guest baggage so if there is cargo ‚Äúguest baggage is the last priority‚Äù keep this in mind when booking. I am happy to finally receive my bag however I wonder I shouldn‚Äôt have to work for my bag that I paid the airline to take responsibility for.

Security/Safety?? What happened to flight attendant with names? LOST LUGGAGE,Zagreb,Bordeaux,Europe,"Air France‚Äôs website is appalling for starters as one couldn‚Äôt press Agree or Confirm buttons to proceed to next screen. I booked the airline as it was the best way to travel from Zagreb to Bordeaux via CdG airport. Booking was difficult and when one contacted ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù there was no service. The Security/Safety staff were friendly on both legs of the journey but the snacks handed out were ghastly on both legs.
There was a short connection time which we made, after racing from one terminal to another, through security and customs, only to have to join a numbered queue and wait as the flight was delayed. This was interesting as my husband‚Äôs suitcase arrived in Bordeaux at 22.25, but mine didn‚Äôt, ‚Äòdue to the short connection‚Äô. We contacted the Air France Lost Luggage women, who were located right next to the baggage carousel. The one who ‚Äòhelped‚Äô was arrogant and unhelpful as we filled in the required information on the computer stand outside their office. I asked what time the first flight was the next morning and told her they could deliver said suitcase to the hotel as soon as it came in. I couldn‚Äôt track the suitcase as the PDF attachment to an email was also in French. After several emails saying my suitcase had been found and that it was on its way from CdG to Bordeaux, my husband made several phone calls to the number on the Reference Dossier. What a circus. After an inordinate amount of time, he had to press 9 for English and got French. So he started over and over until at last he found an English speaking human who assured us that the suitcase would be coming on a late afternoon flight after 5.00 pm. 
My husband was thrilled and asked if he could meet the flight to pick up the suitcase. NON. The delivery would perhaps take place that evening (within 24 hours) or maybe 48 hours. After further phone calls, the delivery would take place at 21.00 due to my husband‚Äôs hassling no doubt. My husband looked out the window at 21.20 to see a small car pull up and the suitcase arrive.
We were staying 500 metres from the Bordeaux Aeroport as it was close to the lease car pickup!! Back to Emirates Business Class on the way home. We can‚Äôt say we weren‚Äôt warned when we told people we were travelling Air France and an airport worker, whose suitcase also didn‚Äôt arrive, said that lost baggage happens all the time.

great flight and food from LAX to PPT but lack of food when returning,Papeete,Los Angeles,International,"Boeing 777; comfortable seats; good room for legs when lie flat option is used. Nice quilt and pillow. Good sized TV but movie selection not to our taste and limited new releases in English. Overall lots of languages available. Very nice little cabinet (with small mirror) to put you stuff into. Pleasant services.
Food: this was problematic. 7:30A departure. No breakfast was offered. 2 hrs. into flight got lunch (really?). It was a nice tray, etc. - No other snacks offered during flight and 2 hrs. before landing got a pitiful plate of what looked like some appetizer; no rolls or bread, some fruit. Pathetic. We had a relatively short connection. That means you have to get thru customs, transfer from Int'l to domestic since we don't live in LA; loooong walk. Had a couple of minutes to grab some food in the lounge and get to the gate only to find out that the flight was delayed.

All the flights were on time, they were not overbooked, and the flight attendants were wonderful.  In fact, I think two of the nicest flight attendants I've encountered in a lifetime of flying were on two legs of this trip with Air France. 

I was in an exit row for three of the four legs of the trip, so sat across from a flight attendant for take off and landings.The fee to reserve an exit row seat was very reasonable and is worth it, though please note that if you are in the exit row ALL of your belongings must be in the overhead bin for take off and landings. If the one directly above your seat is full, this can be pretty inconvenient. Also, because I was in the aisle seat, I didn't have a ""pocket"" to store reading material. Also, the exit row seats don't have phone rechargers.

Not so chic (dried vomit on seat),New York City,Paris,International,"If your airline is constantly telling me that it is ‚Äúchic,‚Äù it must not be very chic. Such is the case with Air France, which we flew between NYC and Paris on their 777 and A380. 

Starting with the positives: food was above average, the legroom was better than British Airways, and crew is friendly enough. If traveling as a couple, try to grab the double seats at the rear of the cabin on their 777 - they felt much roomier and private than other long haul economy seats we‚Äôve tried. 

Negatives - my girlfriend had to sit on the provided blanket because THERE WAS DRIED VOMIT ALL OVER HER SEAT, and there was also a streak of it on the screen in front as well. This was completely unacceptable and disgusting and, to be fair, we should have brought it up to the cabin crew at the time. Also, if flying on the A380, note that the overhead storage bins towards the rear of the upper deck are VERY tiny above the window seats - though this is not the airline‚Äôs fault. The extremely outdated cabin and uncomfortable seats on their A380, however, are entirely Air France‚Äôs fault. The 777 product was much nicer and newer apart from our dirty seat.

My wife was using a cane, and the Air France ground staff were very solicitous.  Once in the air I cannot say the same for the flight crew.  Our primary steward seemed indifferent at best, and it appeared to be a bother for him to have to be working.  The food was edible.  The selection of movies was okay.

Poor film selection on the outbound and not much better on the return. We had booked an upgrade meal, which was served very promptly on the way out but on the return we had to ask for a drink to go with the meal and weren't offered a second.

"Good Service,Extremely Bad logistics and Schedule",Paris,Canton of Geneva,Europe,"Dear Fellow Traveller,
Would like to share my experience of my recent flight out of Paris to Geneva on AF.
On the plus side,AF has considerably improved under the new Canadian management.Flight attendants and check in agents have gone out of their way to check in bags at the very last minute and guide you to the layout of this terminal for you to be able to catch the flight within very tight timing.The service on board was excellent, nothing  to complain about.
The problem lies in codeshared flights which may or may not have a legitimate connection.Absolutely  not flexible call centre politics, once they sell you a flight,forget about good will, flexibility or compromise.
Definitely,the AF Paris to Geneva remains a very good option,provided the Air France becomes serious about customer service and extends the schedule beyond the very last flight at 20.45 pm.
Although AF is very often fashionably late,you as a fellow passenger stand a better chance of making this connection.
Recommended,
provided the management extends the flights to cover later flights,like the 21.30 pm departure.
Good luck and safe travels!

I am 5'10"" and my husband is 6'3"" we were both disappointed in the leg room, we expect less leg room for local flights, but were sadly disappointed on this international flight. Even the seats were not very comfortable for this long flight.  Not to mention if the person in front of you decides to recline because it is a long flight, there is not much difference.  I also understand that people pay for the luxury of business and first class at a premium, but seriously for an 11 hour flight there should be a little more leg room, and more room so when you do recline and the person behind you needs to get up you are not disturbing their peace.

Air France flight attendant helped unaccompanied minor when Delta messed up several times,Minneapolis,Paris,International,"I called Delta's Unaccompanied Minor Program four times over four months and each time they had somehow lost all of my daughter's pick-up and drop-off information. At the airport last night, no one had even been alerted that she was an unaccompanied minor and there was AGAIN no drop-off or pick-up info. Her flight was through partner AirFrance. AirFrance was alarmed and disgusted that they had no information because they did not have anyone to accompany her off the plane in Paris. My daughter reported to me that the Air France flight attendants were very nice to her and were really mad about Delta. The head flight attendant accompanied my daughter off the plane, through passport control, through baggage claim and customs, all the way to my father-in-law's arms. I don't believe that was her job. She seriously saved the day.

But after we moved the 3 seats, another passenger appeared, so less spacious than the original ones, and I asked the crew to move us back to the original seats, she refused because she already arranged another passenger to seat on our original seats. 

Then she suggested she write report to their customer service to refund the extra cost for our original seats to compensate but the result from customer service later by email was that even they cannot refund at all.

Enough extra that we could actually stretch out. The second upgrade was the food. I figured better cafeteria food. Was i wrong on that. It was as if Air France was trying to show off. If so, they were very successful. No question that the nearby passengers saw us and will do the dinner upgrade.

In total we must have called about 100 times (I'm not exaggerating) without success. Eventually we were told the bag hadn't arrived on Friday.

This was odd, as there was no plane from Paris on that day. How and when will you deliver it to us? we asked. They then went silent again. From time to time they suggested that we should track the bag ourselves via their website. And at the same time, they had the nerve to send a customer satisfaction survey. It didn't arrive on the Sunday. In fact we got it on day 10 of our holiday. We made a claim for out of pocket expenses. They chiselled us out of $60 because we didn't have a taxi receipt - have you tried getting a receipt from a Costa Rican taxi driver who speaks no English?

AF - Lagos Route Deserves A Better Service Arrangemet.....,Austin,Lagos,International,"I booked Delta/AirFrance to travel from USA to Lagos Nigeria. The first 2 legs of my trip was a bit memorable but the Last leg completely eroded all the memories.

I bet AF will never used this plane on some Western route. Why trying it on African most populous country/route?  
We had almost a 2 hours delayed on the tarmac @ CDG due to inexperience boarding process in place. This put my family (travelling for the 1st time back to Lagos in years) at risk as we got to Lagos very late at night.

The food wasn't too bad (dinner and the typical boxed breakfast), coffee was God awful but my complaint...although I am not much of a drinker, the male flight attendant spent more time speaking with a select few passengers. Asking for a beverage seemed to be an inconvenience.
No one in Boston told me that I had the right to use the Air France club so I used the Priority Pass lounge in Terminal E. In Paris, I decided to try my luck having both my Delta Sky Miles card and Priority. I was not asked for either one.

The seat entertainment screen was modern, new and fairly big. I was disappointed with the movie selection, but the maps were high tech in 3D, very nice.
Meals were OK, nothing special, I remember better days for AF in Economy, but it becomes understandable nowadays in cutting the expenses.
Worst of all was the time before take off. In the last row there was a woman (Panama citizen) sitting, with two policewomen on her sides who were deporting her out of France. She was screaming and yelling all the time, so it was very unpleasant and annoying for all of us, and frightening the kids.

Scams on Baggage and YELLED at customer,Paris,Rome,Europe,"WARNING, if you are flying with AirFrance please know that carry on luggage must be under 12kg total (for anything you're carrying on). they do a ""random"" check on people trying to go through security and weigh your bags.  My mother and I were over the weight  limit so had to go to baggage drop.  Baggage drop had a LONG line, the machine wasn't working hence we started to run out of time to our departure...so I had to personally speak to a staff for help while my mother stayed in line.
She agreed to help and told me AGGRESSIVELY to tell my mother to come over.  So my mother simply went other the lining ropes (no one was in that particular line), but the lady lost her marbles. She started YELLING so loudly ""DO YOU DO THAT IN AMERICA, THATS UNACCEPTABLE HERE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND."" My mother who does not speak english as her first language did not know what to say.  All customers had our eyes on us and her yelling was to the point that her spit was landing on my face.  After all that they lady charged me 40 Euros for my bag to be checked.  THIS EXPERIENCE, was thought to be a form of racism as we were selectively chosen to weigh our baggage as we were one of the few asians in line.  Others were all white passengers and they were all being handled in a more calm manner.
After running to the gate, turns out that the airline was checking in baggage for free anyway.  Felt like we were scammed and if we were not ""chosen"" for bagging weighing we would have been able to check in our bags for free in the first place.
This experience left a bad aftertaste in our mouth for the Paris trip.  Quite interesting to see the difference in people were handled just because of their looks.",2019-03,2019-05-01,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0
They recovered well,Seattle,Paris,International,"For my husbands 50th birthday we recently flew to France to tour the wine regions of Bordeaux and Burgundy.
As part of his birthday celebrations, we decided to fly Business Class.
Check in was great (there is never a queue) and the flight was great with amazing service and food that just kept coming.
Can't say I was overly impressed by the Business Class cabin. The seats and controls are a little dated and worn.
To top it off, when we arrived in Paris, one of our bags was missing and to be honest, I expected more accuracy considering what we paid for the tickets.
Air France have a very good system for reporting lost luggage. One of the staff helped us fill in the details on the terminal and she also advised that we could buy some necessities and be reimbursed at a later date. They also told us the bag would be delivered to Bordeaux which is where we were heading.
The online tracking turned out to be useless as it only updated once we were told the bag was being delivered. Lucky for us we kept calling the number provided and did not rely on the website.
The bag finally arrived in Bordeaux after 3 days but to our disappointment, we discovered that the bag had actually been sitting at Bordeaux airport for 3 days (it arrived in Paris 9 hours after our flight).
That said, Air France did deliver the bag directly to the hotel and they reimbursed us for the purchases we made within days of our claim being submitted.
The experience was disappointing but it has not tarnished our view toward Air France, I would fly them again.",2019-04,2019-05-01,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0

Now factor in running 1.5 hours later for a 45 minute flight, slow baggage delivery (toke half hour for bags that should not have needed to be checked) and we had to run throughout Heathrow for connecting flight.

"Worst airline ever, worst customer service ever",Hong Kong,Paris,International,"I booked a 30,000 HKD (over 3,000 EUR) flight in premium economy from Hong Kong to Paris with Air France. I usually fly with Cathay Pacific because their service is so much better than Air France but this time, their premium economy was fully booked and I had to go straight to work after a 13-hour flight so I figured I'd try AF once again (previous experience, my flight was cancelled and staff was rude). At check in, they told me that my agent booked a seat in premium despite the class being fully booked. This was a lie. I called my agent who confirmed I paid extra actually to have a seat confirmed in premium economy. AF overbooked their premium economy, downgraded me, lied to me first and then did nothing but offered a 150 EUR voucher that I can only use on AF flights (which couldn't be more useless since I never intend to fly this horrible airline again). And the funny thing is that they said I could use the 150 EUR voucher to get an upgrade in the future. 
I asked if my return flight could be in business since they downgraded me to economy with no prior warning (I would've flown Cathay's economy if I had known) and their response was simply no.

Not very impressed with their Business Class flight,Paris,Bangkok,International,"I have flown on several airlines on business class before, and I have to say that the AF flight was very average compared to other airlines. I'm breaking down the criteria:
Legroom - Not spacious enough, and I'm not even tall (I'm just 5'4"")
Seat comfort - Not very comfortable, not wide enough. I could not even lie on my back in comfort, thus could not sleep very well in-flight.
In-flight Entertainment - Adequate
Customer service - Adequate. There were about 3 meal choices, and the attendants asked each biz class passenger their preferences, including us. However, when it was time to serve the meal, we were told that sorry, our choice had already run out. My question was - WHY? Why would you ask someone for their meal choice when clearly, there was no choice at the end? Why could they not have informed us that what we wanted was not longer available AT THE TIME THEY ASKED FOR OUR CHOICE? I found this quite annoying and frustrating. I get that this may happen in economy, but we were in Business Class!! They couldn't count how many meat dishes were still available?? For me, this is a fail in customer service. Otherwise, there was nothing overly exciting about the meal choices, nor the snacks (chocolates, Thai cup noodles, wine and soda)
Value for money - Average
Cleanliness - Okay
Check-in and boarding - Not sure if this is partly the fault of the airline, but during boarding, soon after we presented our boarding pass to the ground attendant, we were stopped by one who I presume was an airport security officer. We were stopped and questioned like we were Southeast Asian undocumented aliens trying to leave their beloved country in stealth mode. It was only until I presented my UN Laissez Passe passport that this officer gradually lowered his guard a little. Still, in a probable last attempt to justify his unwarranted questioning (my sister and I were held and questioned at the business class boarding gate, in front of the other passengers for more than 5 minutes!!!), he posed his last question to us: Did you bring in more than USD10,000 in cash into France? DUH?! Did we look THAT dumb, just because we were Filipinos? I'm sure he would have loved to hear us say yes so that he could detain us further and not allow us to take our flight back to Bangkok. And all the while, the AF ground attendants were doing nothing, just listening in on our convo, when they knew that we were there on business, my sister had a valid French tourist visa, we only stayed about 9 days in all, and we were traveling biz class both ways!!! Are those the profile of undocumented SE Asian aliens?? Pathetic!!

Air France - Late and Lacking basic communication,Paris,Casablanca,International,"Booked Paris to Casablanca today. Boarding was a disorganized effort by zones with no zone signs! Security delay where every passenger had ID & boarding pass double checked. No explanation offered. Plane at least an hour late.
No advice to passengers disembarked in Casablanca that they need to fill out an arrival card. These not handed out ahead of time like most other airlines; not even information about where to locate them in the airport!
A number of elderly passengers confused & frustrated.
Ranked experience a 4 only because of valiant effort by the cabin crew to make the best of a bad situation. I think they were embarrassed themselves but were very professional & respectful regardless.

The cabin staff are polite to a fault, and although the snack was limited it was tasty (and so was the wine which was available to accompany it).

Great Start for a Vacation,Los Angeles,Paris,International,"Air France offers excellent 1st class service. The service, food & entertainment as well as comfort were spot on.

2nd Air France offers pick up service from airport to hotel upon arrival in their advertising. We could find no one to assist us in using this service. When we called Air France we of course got a Delta rep who told us that service was only available to Premiere passengers not first class. Dull I think a little more training is in order.

Really surprised with the condition of the aircraft on my return flight,Paris,Los Angeles,International,"Booked a premium economy round trip ticket Los Angeles to Paris.  My LAX to Paris flight was good and as expected -  but my return flight earlier today was B for BAD!  I departed from Paris at approximately 1:50 pm -  the flight crew were good -  they did not come around as much as I have experienced on other similar flights.   

Here is my big issue-  normally I don‚Äôt review airlines but this needs to be noted because I am questioning my loyalty to Air France.  

I get to the seat and laying on top of the seats in front of me and my partner is the top of an arm rest.  No one did anything about it so we put it in the overhead compartment.  

The panel that covers the life vest kept falling.  I have a picture posted below.  

My seat did not work and it was quite frustrating .  The foot rest did not go done and stay.  The seat also did not recline I had to kick the  foot rest back with a tremendous amount of force 

Toward the end of the flight water started dripping on me.

Our usual route takes us 10.5 hours, but it feels much shorter than that. Even though there are less expensive carriers, we honestly don't see the point.

Could do much better,New Delhi,Paris,International,"As usual the flight was delayed and I missed my connecting flight.

Again they ran out of a choice of meals and actually theres far too much items on the tray. They really need quality not quantity.

No Fly Zone,London,Paris,Europe,"Had booke a year in advance for flights to London Heathrow to St Maartin via Paris. All was well until about a month before when the main airline was changed resulting in many attempts to secure seating. Then a few weeks before departure our Heathrow flight was cancelled and brought forward, no problem you ask, well a week later the early flight was cancelled and was a later flight at 09.30 meaning the we would arrive in Paris over an hour after our connecting flight had left. Contacted Air France and was told basically, tough. Get yourself to Orly or go out three days later. What a totally unacceptable customer response. In the end we had to transfer to a partner airline and fly out a day earlier. This meant arranging an additional nights accommodation at our destination.

The flight was on time and seating was fine and unbeknownst to me included a snack and drink. However, the snack was a goat's cheese sandwich. Tasted OK but not something that I would order.

Air France is a great airline to Europe and Beyond,Seattle,Casablanca,International,We flew on Air France this month to Casablanca and out of Marakesh.  Both flights were a good value and really good food and drink. I think it is because the French have higher standards in dining that overrides the airline's need to cut costs.

HORRFYING experience on a BUSINESS-Class UPGRADE on my Honeymoon.,New Delhi,Mexico City,International,"**Please read this if you are planning to upgrade to Business Class or Premium Economy after purchasing an Economy class ticket** (LONG READ)

TL;DR: If you are using the web system to upgrade, make a separate EMD number is generated for each journey, for each passenger. Else, face hell.

So this review is for our trip for our Honeymoon in January 2019. 

Trip: New Delhi > Paris CDG > Mexico City .. and back.

We purchased economy class tickets from New Delhi to Paris (CDG) and then onwards from Paris to Mexico City after a 5 hour stopover. 
We dabbled with the idea of upgrading our class due to the long duration of our flight and finally decided to upgrade using the Air France online system that comes up when you go for an online-check in option. 
While checking in - we upgraded our trip from New Delhi to Paris to Premium Economy class and from Paris CDG to Mexico City (13 hours) to Business class to make the journey more comfortable. For this we paid online using a credit card and shortly after we received confirmation emails confirming the upgrade for both legs of the journey for both passengers including our seat numbers.

The trouble started when we reached the airport for the first leg of our flight. For some reason, though we have paid for 4 upgrades together (2 pax, 2 journeys), the upgrade showed in their 'system' for only one passenger. When we showed them the confirmation emails and our boarding passes with seats - they asked us to wait. After 60 minutes of standing at the checkin counter (thank god we reached early) the senior manager arrives and tells us they will contact the CDG office to confirm as the system showed only 1 EMD number has been generated for the upgrade. (only for 1 passenger)

This is true and checks out as our confirmation email has only 1 EMD number (no idea what this means but apparently is the autogenerated number and there should be 1 for each passenger)

After 15 more minutes they finally call CDG and confirm that it has in fact been upgraded successfully and hand us our printed boarding passes with business class seats from Paris to Mexico City as planned. They apologise for the trouble and give us first class lounge access for the 30 mins we still had before our departure. 

We reach Paris and use the business lounge to freshen up using our boarding passes and all is fine. When the flight from Paris to Mexico is ready for boarding, we are stopped at the gate for the same issue again - one passenger upgrade is gone through, not the other.

Here is where the NIGHTMARE begins. The Air France staff, despite seeing that we are holding business class boarding passes are ridiculously rude and talking down at us. They are questioning whether the payment has gone through and ask us to pay for 1 passengers upgrade again. We show them the email showing the payment and also the Air France confirmation email showing us the upgrades, the seats, everything, with no avail!

My wife's boarding pass shows a business seat and they take away my boarding pass and tear it (yes! in front us) and then issue me a middle seat in economy. At this point the boarding is almost complete and they threaten to close the gate without us. My wife panics and we hand them our credit card to charge us again (we have no option and we figure we will deal with customer care later). The lady gets on the phone to make the payment while a gate executive from Air France (white, bald guy in his 40s) tell us verbatim - "" Next time if you can afford to buy business class outright don't bother with economy and then upgrading""

I am in disbelief at this point but the ball is in their court as I am completely helpless. I ignore this downright ridiculous insult and wait on the lady to complete the payment. She informs me the payment is declined ( weird as I have her my international signature Visa card with a high limit). By now she threatens us that we must board 1 business 1 economy or not board at all. All boarding is complete and we are left with no option. The flight is an A380 with different floors for business and economy and my wife is in tears on our HONEYMOON trip on the aerobridge to the flight. I am requesting them to try my Amex or Master or take cash!! But they are adamant and refuse the offer for cash. I tell them to give me a link - I will buy the onboard wifi and make the payment online. This request is also shot down. I am confused. Why are 2 passengers being harassed for a fault of their own booking system? We have everything to make our case, except the will of the Air France staff to help us out.

Anyway, we board the plane - my wife is escorted to her business seat and I am taken to to my economy seat. Determined, I ask to meet the head cabin attendant - I am made to wait for 15 minutes in the aisle with my carry on. While the ground staff tells the attendant in French ""The Indian guy is trying to get on business with an economy ticket"" (having studied in Lyon, I pick up on French without speaking it too well). But I still plead my case, ignoring their racist, insulting remarks.  I show him the email confirmation and he finally patiently hears me out. Then, immediately says that this has happened before with him in another flight and it is, indeed, their mistake of the EMD number not being generated. THEIR MISTAKE. He realises that we are well traveled and finally checks with the Indian office while the plane is getting ready. He then 'does us a favour' and finally gives me the business seat booked for me previously. An absolutely disgraceful experience for no reason at all. 

After take off they soon realise they had messed up and we get 2-3 people come and apologise to us. What's worse is that on landing I found out that the credit card was declined as the lady gave the wrong CVV number on the phone. A series of insulting events which could have easily been avoided by the staff being more cooperative. It made me realise I will never travel on Air France again.

The food and the champagne, went a long way to improve our experience later on - it was just the ground staff that was too rude and unprofessional for us to believe.

For anyone looking for upgrade make sure you do it on the phone and there are EMD numbers generated for each passenger. And good luck.",2019-01,2019-04-22,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,5.0

We had purchased seats months ago and we were supposed to sit in two seats without a middle seat. However they changed planes and there were only rows with middle seats. I was stuck in a middle seat for almost nine hours. Ugh. Plus the seats were really uncomfortable and had zero back support. While the crew was attentive and very pleasant the seats were not. I will try to avoid Air France in the future.,2019-04,2019-04-21,3.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

Extras in premium Economy Air France,Los Angeles,Casablanca,International,"We booked a premium economy flight from LAX to CNM Casablanca, changing planes at CDG CHARLES de Gaul, Paris.  The first 11 hour leg was in premium, second 3 hour leg was plain economy. 
Premium gives you a bigger seat with a console between seats, more leg room, scootch forward reclining so the person in front of you is not in your lap when they recline, a foot rest, nice pillow and comforter, noise canceling head phones (love them),slightly better food, wine and service. 

The extra cost provides comfort, but not a seat that makes into a sleeper. Unless you can sleep sitting in your seat do not expect a good night‚Äôs sleep. Is it worth it?  
If money is tight examine how valuable the added benefits are to you as a traveler. We did not expect to sleep. Business class was too costly, so we went Premium Economy, leaving home a day early, spent the night in a nice hotel and slept well, ready to join our tour the next day.

Friendly and efficient,Paris,Toulouse,Domestic,"Crowded airport and priority check in a little slow but pleasant. Self checking available if you have no luggage, there are even impressive automated self-drop counters for luggage... but they did not work. 

Fairly fast security, not much in the waiting room, decent self-service bar. There is a lounge for top elite status passengers like me, basic (I bought a sandwich outside) but spacious with nice views. 

Short uneventful flight with free soft drinks, crew relaxed and friendly. On time, clean plane, slimline seats were OK for the duration but I do not love them.

They did not let me board my plane to Paris,Los Angeles,Cairo,International,"Delta-KLM-AF are all now one company.  When I flew from Tucson to Los Angeles, Delta never said one thing to me about my passport having 5 months and 25 days left.  While boarding in LAX my name was called and it was then that the AF agent told me i could not board the plane.  He was counting with his fingers the days and told me that I needed 6 months in my passport, that Egypt nor Turkey would give me visas.  When i provided my visas for them to see, they still did not let me board saying that France would not let me enter either.   Because according them I was a NO SHOW,   AF invalidated my original ticket and made me purchase a new set of tickets for 4 days later when i could get an emergency passport.   This was the worst treatment.  The least they could have done was to use my original tickets and let me re-use them 4 days later.  Nope, i had to buy new tickets for 2 people.  My husband could not fly because he has confusion caused by medications for Parkinsons, so we had to arrive to our 2nd country Israel, rather than Egypt.

AF failed me as a customer,Bucharest,Paris,Europe,"I have been a customer since 2009, when I was able to fly on my own.

I flew AF 4 times in the past month and every single time they applied the same method to convince passengers to drop their carry ons.

You don‚Äôt get what you pay for ...,Amsterdam,Los Angeles,International,"One of the worst travel experiences I‚Äôve had. Inefficient, unprofessional, unhelpful and unfriendly. Both the Paris airport and Air France.  Even with a 15 minute delay, I would NEVER have missed my flight if
1)Air France had let the people with close connecting flights off first, which is a normal courtesy on all other airlines. 
2) Air France had any kind of staff or help to assist us with getting to our gate. By the time I got to our gate (which of course had taken off I had been in the system at the airport at slightly after 12pm and my flight didn‚Äôt leave until 1:25!  No customer service whatsoever, just inefficiency, choas, zero assistance for travelers.
3) Airport personnel of any kind anowledged any of us as we ran through the terminal, waited helplessly for buses that  were few and far apart,  waiting for elevators that clearly weren‚Äôt designed to help a major group of passengers get to their next stop where more inefficiency awaited, and the passport check line was a total joke. The few staff onsite either didn‚Äôt speak English, ignored us, and literally dismissed us saying we had plenty of time. I am young and fit and had a priority seat and ran and waited and ran and still missed my flight.  

To add insult to injury as missed flights do happen, the Air France employee at the gate that had just closed by the time I ran to the counter was dismissive and lacked any kind of customer service skills. She actually talked to me like it was my fault when I hadn‚Äôt stop running for a minute except when I waited for and waited for connecting services that were the worst I‚Äôve ever ever experienced, including India. Then she sent me curtly back to another gate where I waited for rebook, also not a pleasant experience with Air France staff.

What is the point of priory tickets, priority boarding, or anything if there are no extra lines, serve attendants, or help getting you on your plane when there actually is technically time? 

What really is disheartening is the on the flight, getting off the plane, get to the gate late, and trying to rebook, it was like the Air France captain, attendants, and airport staff not only didn‚Äôt give a damn, but actually seemed smug and condescending.

Don't wait for transfer passangers & make them pay full price of a new ticket,Bologna,Kyiv,Europe,"Connecting flights from hell: I had a ticket going from Italy to Ukraine with a stopover in Paris where I would go thru passport control to leave EU. For that the airline considered 1 hour should be enough. Normally, if a passanger is running slightly late, the wait. Or put the passenger onto the next flight, correct? Not with AirFrance: these folks left me stranded even thou the entire 700+ line of ppl at the passport control consisted of those running late for connecting flights and there were ONLY 3 officers checking and stamping passports. 

Now, I get it's not smth the airline has control over, but it's their home airport in Paris, they know their passport control is overcrowded and understaffed, why the hell sell such short connections? 

The first fliht was 10 minutes late (the captain announced it upon landing and apologized for it), but when I got to the transit desk, asking to put me onto the next flight since I missed this one by 12 minutes, they said that my flight... actually arrived earlier, not later. And that the airline has no obligation to provide me with anything at all. The literally told me to go and buy a new plane ticket!

Ultimately, Air France does NOT guarantee your connection. If you're late, you're on your own and you pay for the new ticket from your own pocket.

What is even worse, is that Air France staff simply dismisses you, telling you to go to the other desk, other place etc, knowing you won't be able to come back to them again. 

I didn't have a credit\debit card on me, so I had to figure out a way to buy a new ticket with cash. I found the cheapest option with a different airline. 

The AirFrance transit helpdesk literally said: ""Go to our Air France ticketing office, we are in alliance with Czech Airlines, we will book you a new flight"". Guess what? At the ticketing office I was informed that Air France has nothing to do with Czech Airlines. 

When I finally bouht my tickets, I also had to search for my luggage. I came to the Air France luggage desk and showed them my new ticket. They re-registered it to go thru a new route (now making me go back into EU and then out of it once again in a different country). Thing is, my luggage didn't arrive to the destination, even thou I paid for luggage yet again.

They delivered my suitcase next day, it looked like they'd played football with it, everyting inside was broken and messed up.

So, having originally bought a ticket for 250 euros, they suggested I pay additional 500 euros at the airport because I was 12 minutes late for my connecting flight.",2019-04,2019-04-15,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

The menu is ok and especially from EZE they serve really nice bread. Much better than the spongy bread they serve from Paris. Flying a French Airline you expect them to be able to serve French bread which is at least more fresh and crisp instead of spungy. It is a pity also that the broadcast mainly French movies and less English language.

Our flight to CVG with Delta in a 767 was alright ‚Äì we were probably in the cheapest seats available and the nine hour flight went by fairly quickly thanks to the up to date films and service we received from the cabin crew. We have flown this route many times before but since Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport was downgraded and now,  I believe, has only  one international flight a day (ours) things have gone from bad to worse. Clearing immigration is what it is ‚Äì a long wait with one immigration officer for all the non American visitors ‚Äì our immigration officer was very polite and courteous. We collected our luggage and cleared customs no problems but we knew what awaited and knew it wasn‚Äôt good. They take your luggage from you again if you‚Äôre exiting the airport and you have to collect it at another terminal ‚Äì fair enough, no problem with that. Trouble is there is no ‚Äòairside‚Äô at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport for onward travellers to get to connecting flights. Consequently all international inward passengers must go through security not only to get another flight but also TO LEAVE THE AIRPORT. You stand in line whilst security bark their orders ‚Äò everything bigger than a phone out of your bags‚Äô, ‚Äòany food out of your bags‚Äô, ‚Äòany medicine, any liquid out of your bags‚Äô, ‚Äò shoes off, coats off, belts off‚Äô, etc etc. No please, no thank you, just lots of shouting at passengers who have been on a nine hours flight and have all probably been travelling a lot longer ‚Äì definitely not a nice experience. When I say bark I mean it ‚Äì they shout at the top of their voices repeatedly. Then everyone must go through the body scanner ‚Äì the whole procedure at security takes well over an hour bearing in mind that most of the people, Americans and visitors alike get the same treatment. Many onward passengers, including Americans, complained about the time it took without a glimmer of hope that it would make any difference. Most people just wanted to exit the airport but got the same treatment. This is the only airport that I know where passengers WANTING TO EXIT an airport are treated in such a manner. Goodness knows how much the cost is. Clearly I can understand those travelling to an onward destination being scanned again but this procedure for passengers wanting to EXIST is simply ridiculous. My advice to you, if you are flying into Cincinnati /Northern Kentucky InternationalAirport on an international flight as an onward traveller or wanting to go to Cincinnati is to choose another airport to enter America ‚Äì any airport. OK that‚Äôs the gripe out of the way ‚Äì best bit is that on the return trip, as always, there were no problems at all ‚Äì security on departing flights is the same as at other airports - good as gold. 
Our return flight from CVG to CDG was on a much older 767 ‚Äì tiny TV screens and ear sockets that were well used. My wife‚Äôs volume was set really high and no attempt fix it was successful. Cabin crew once again very good as was our transfer at CDG. Our plane back to Newcastle was much newer and all passengers had no problems with their hand luggage ‚Äì an opposite of our flight into CDG.
Bottom line is that by continually checking both Air France and Delta websites we both got our flights for under ¬£500 each which is incredible value for money. Next time however I do really think that we will fly into another airport to avoid flying into Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport on an international flight. I would recommend you do the same.",2019-03,2019-04-14,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0
Air France is the worst,Miami,Paris,International,"Our nonstop flight out Miami was cancelled with no explanation from AirFrance and unable to reach them by phone because we were driving 2 hours to Miami. Their app was not at all helpful and finally we were able to rebook our outbound flight with a be ry helpfully Delta agent, but had to connect through Atlanta which we could have done six months ago from our home airport in Ft Myers, but we chose a nonstop on Air France. We were told by Air France that they didn‚Äôt recognize Delta preferred seat status but would give us a discount if we purchased an up front seat which we did on our outbound flight..... that was cancelled!! Delta was very accommodating on our rebook, but we still had to connect thru ATL. Our Delta flights were perfect, but we arrived in Paris 4 hours later than or original time. Air France never communicated with us at all and we found oot that the original flight was rescheduled with a different flight number and left Miami 4-5 hours later than scheduled. Our return nonstop on Air France was uneventful except for being told many times by gate agents and AirFrance lounge employees that they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt recognize‚Äù Delta status or American Express access. Repeating ‚Äúwe have no relationship with American Express‚Äù. The level of service on the flight was terrible with no flight attendant doing any service except the two ‚Äúmeal‚Äù services. We were told we could come to the back the plane for drinks or snacks which we did not do so don‚Äôt know how that would work. All in all the flight attendants were rude and unhelpful. In our bulkhead row, 5 of the 8 pull up video players or trays were broken and obviously had been for a while because of evidence of previous tape marks on the posts. Unacceptable. We are 70 year old lifetime world travelers and have never had a worse experience with airline in terms of service that would be normally expected.

Dirty and old plane!,Chicago,Paris,International,I had heard that the crew wasn‚Äôt nice but I found that they were extremely friendly and was happy with that. What I had an issue with was the plane seemed really old. Seats had broken pieces that were taped up with masking tape and they had stains all over them. The headrest sides wouldn‚Äôt stay in place. There were old orange peels in the back pocket of the seat in front of me. The tray back was also covered in dried up food. It was hot and it felt like there wasn‚Äôt any air moving.

The connection flight from hell.. don‚Äôt fly with this company EVER,D√ºsseldorf,Paris,Europe,"My one hour flight to Paris to get my connection to Australia caused me 3 days of delay. 
The original flight from D√ºsseldorf was delayed by 4 hours which caused me to miss my two other connections in France. There was no information or any kind of help from the staff as to what was happening to cause this delay other than the plane had not started yet, but that would have been ok. 
They booked me onto another flight (after a 9 hour layover in Paris) which was supposed to get me to Singapore then Aus. After boarding the plane and a wait of 4 hours the captain eventually stated the flight was canceled due to computer issues.
We were then taken off the plane and after 2 hours of lining up we where given hotels from airfrance in which we would have to travel via a train which didn‚Äôt run past 1am, awesome news as the tickets where given to us at 1am üôÑ. 
After another 14 hours of waiting airfrance eventually left after another small delay with refueling and loading. I was then booked onto another flight to Australia from Singapore with only a 8 hour delay at the airport there. 
I could list 5000 things wrong with this airline from this one experience but that is a small example of some of the highlights.

sorry people but so i was always allowed to fly C or First class free of charge - but still able to appreciate - now that i have to pay for my tickets i am also allowed to give my honest and professional opinion. 
Business seats in our flight to Cancun were outdated, little travel bag poor, some of the crew members too familiar and occupied with themselves (i am not interested who is being retired) - service not bad not good - food not bad not good.  flat beds not real comfortable.

Buyer Beware,Bucharest,New York City,International,"Buyer's Beware. Unlike any other airline we have ever flown, Air France has consistently delivered a poor experience from the purchasing of the ticket through the actual flight experience. If you are unlucky enough to have any issue along the way, expect their customer service to be dismissive, rude, and simply unhelpful. 

On one roundtrip from Bucharest to Paris to New York Kennedy, I had my flight cancelled both ways. Delays on every single leg. If this was due to weather or other issues, it would be fine. Except, it wasn't. Air France has mechanical issues on the plane and never communicated that to us. Then they had the audacity to refuse meal tickets and made the rebooking process a two-day affair. 

I fly this route of OTP - CDG - JFK or IAD frequently. I wish, more than anything in the world, that I had another option but Air France. Unfortunately, I really don't as KLM is tremendously more expensive at times.

Enjoyable first time experience with Air France,Los Angeles,Papeete,International,"My husband and I were flying from LAX to PPT/Tahiti on 5/17/18 and then return from PPT/Tahiti to LAX on 6/3/18.  I had booked 2 economy round trip tickets with Air France directly.  I opted to pay the small uncharge to get seats in the duo row both flights.  Cost total for the 2 of us was $2210.96.  Yikes!!  

We had flown in to LAX on Delta on 5/17/18.  With Delta check in on our first flight leg from Buffalo we were told our baggage would go all the way through to PPT/Tahiti.  We would not have to collect our baggage at LAX for the AF flight.  That was good news to us seniors!

I made a good decision to pay the very small extra amount to get the duo seats.  In these few rows instead of 3 seats in the space there are only 2 seats.  This makes for a bit more comfort (my husband has very long legs at 6'2"" and my legs tend to swell up on flights) and we don't have to worry about disturbing another passenger when we have to get up to stretch our legs, use the restroom.....  Our seats for the 5/17/18 flight were 45A and 45B.  Our seats on the 6/3/18 flight were 46A and 46B.  Plane was a Boeing 777-200 for both flights.

Our flight was AF0076 for 5/17/18.  Scheduled to depart 11:55 PM.  There were very long lines for security as only 1 line was open.  We had TSA precheck but there was no line for the TSA precheck so the wait was longer to get through security.  Check in fine as I had printed out our boarding passes at home for this flight.  There was no gate listed but around 2 hours before departure the gate was listed on the departures board.  

I had bought a bottle of duty free rum and it was waiting at the gate properly packaged for me.  Boarding went smoothly with flight attendants greeting you as you boarded and also to help direct you to your seat. 

Found our seats easily and put carry ons plus my bag of rum in the overhead bin by our seats.  

Flight attendants made sure everyone had seat belt on, seats in upright position, overhead bin doors shut.  Departure was on time.   Safety demonstration.

Snack was offered first.  Orange juice, yogurt, applesauce, roll, cheddar cheese packet, TWIX bar.  Breakfast was a choice of omelet or apple pancakes.  With this you got a fruit cup, yogurt, water, muffin, sliced meat, cheese, roll, butter, jam.  Choice of drink.  We opted for tea.  For airline food this was pretty good.  My only complaint was there was too much and not enough room on the tray to fit it all.

I only watch movies during flights if offered.  There was a good selection.  I watched The Shape of Water and Coco.  

Arrived PPT/Tahiti at 5:30 AM-only 10 minutes later than what had been noted on my flight paperwork.  Smooth landing.  Baggage arrived in fine condition.

Our return flight on 6/3/18 was ok.  It was just so early for me to be at the Faa'a Airport/PPT/Tahiti before 6:00 AM.  This was AF0077 scheduled to depart 7:30 AM. Our baggage would not be checked through to Buffalo as we had to go through Customs upon arrival at LAX.  

There was a long line to get our boarding passes-maybe 30-40 minutes.   I was anxious about the weight of our 2 bags to be checked.  Fine!  I can breathe easy but then the check in person told us our carry ons had to be weighed.  That meant everything-even a purse.  What's allowed is 12 kg each or total 24 kg.  Our 3 pieces were 23.7 kg total!!  Now I really can breathe.

Boarding went smoothly as on our flight on 5/17/18.  Greeting, directing to seats, checking the cabin, safety instructions.  Departure on time and very smooth.

Crackers and drink-apple juice for us.  Then we were given paper menus for our main meal which would be lunch/dinner.  Both options included corn salad & baby veggies with chicken, cheese, applesauce tart, coffee/tea.  Entree choice was beef satay with basmati rice & veggies or yellowfin tuna in white wine sauce/broccoli/buttered boiled potatoes.  Again the quality of the food better than expected.  A small bottle of wine was offered-red or white.  I should note that written on this paper menu it stated that a selection of drinks is available throughout the flight.  Beverages listed-aperitifs, champagne, vins blancs, red wines, beer, mineral water, fruit juices, sodas, hot beverages....  And this was just what was listed for economy.  Our last meal was orange juice, fruit cocktail, roll, Babybel mozzarella Kinder chocolate, drink.  We had tea.  

Again I enjoyed the inflight entertainment of movies.  A Wrinkle in Time, Red Sparrow.

I should also note that we were provided pillows, blankets, and more to make the long flights as comfortable as possible.  Our first experience flying with Air France was enjoyable.  It's so nice to be offered food, drinks, etc. and not be charged extra.  Also not having to pay for check in baggage was nice.  It's probably all built into the price of the tickets but..........

"Amenities and Food were good, but NO LEG ROOM",Atlanta,Paris,International,"3 out of 5.  All things were great EXCEPT:

- 1.0 for lack of leg room & discomfort, compared to return flight on Delta
- 0.5 for lack of seat comfort, compared to return flight on Delta
- 0.5 for inferior entertainment system/selection, compared to return flight on Delta

We flew to Paris on Air France, and returned via Rome on Delta. This review is for the ATL-Paris leg of the journey on Air France.

We noticed something odd while on the Metro in Paris - my wife (5'10"") and I (5'10"") were taller than 90% of the people!  Does France have shorter people than America?

My guess is ""yes"", since the leg room on our Air France flight was laughable, especially for a 8 hour trans-Atlantic, overnight flight - even for economy class.

As soon as we sat down, our knees were jammed into the seat in front of us. And my poor wife, who has very long legs (even longer than mine!) was in extreme discomfort.

And once the seats in front of us were reclined (which they did about 0.5 seconds into the flight...), the seat, tray tables and TV screens were all up in our face. Like, all up in it!

Yes, the food was marvelous and represented French cuisine well (even in Economy). Yes, the crew was kind and attentive. Yes, the majority of the aspects of the flight were top-notch.  

But the leg room - or lack thereof - was extremely frustrating.

""Well that's what you get for flying Economy"" you say? No. Here's why:

Our return flight was on Delta (from Rome), and our Economy seats on that flght WONDERFUL!!  Plenty of leg room, very comfortable seats (even for us at the back of the plane!) and when the seats in front of use were reclined, they were not at all intrusive.  So there.

So I don't know if French people are shorter, or if Air France was just trying to cram in more cattle, but next time we will fly Delta BOTH ways.

NOTE: We did do one wise thing I would recommend:  Near the back of the plane, the side seats narrow from banks of 3 seats to just 2 seats.  We paid a bit extra ($30-ish each) so we could be together without a 3rd person in our row.  That was a GOOD decision. No one crawling over us in the middle of the night to use the bathroom...",2019-03,2019-04-10,3.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

Disappointed on 10 hr flight,Seattle,Paris,International,We were able to get exit row seats but the armrest between our two seats was loose.  Apparently someone thought it lifted for the tray table and ripped it loose.  It was not repaired during the Seattle layover.  The in-flight movies and music choices were extremely limited. Only about a dozen to choose from on both.  The food wasn‚Äôt bad but we didn‚Äôt get a diabetic option.

No announcements are ever made so the only way to find out anything is by searching it on the internet. Also, every time we have flown with them, our flight has been delayed.

Great Flight!,Paris,Houston,International,This airport is so sprawling that the one hour we had to make our next flight was not enough time even though we did nothing but hustle.  Went to the Air France counter to see what could be done about the missed flight.  At first the agent said she couldn't help us since it was not Air France's fault that we missed the flight.  Maybe it was my kids or maybe it was because I cried but she very graciously changed our flights to later in the afternoon.  Our flight on Air France couldn't have been better.  I highly recommend getting the very last row on the left which is what we had been randomly assigned and it was perfect.  We had room to stand up and walk right behind our seats and stretch. The bathroom was steps away and we never had to wait awkwardly in the aisles.  I am one of the weird people who actually like airplane food and it was great.  Trust the French to give us Camembert cheese.  The movies were good too which was a blessing considering our flight was so long.  The only thing I needed were some more bottles of water which I should have brought on board.  Right before landing we were given another snack which was also great.  Can't say enough great things about Air France and their agents!,2019-04,2019-04-08,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Only consider clients as consumers but not as customers!,Paris,Rome,Europe,"Such a big disappointment ! 

Only consider clients as consumers but not as customers! For personal reasons I missed my flight to Rome. I was in a rush to find new tickets. Nobody took the call at Airfrance customer service within 30min ! As a flying blue member , No benefits to buy a last minute Airfrance ticket. Other companies like VUELING offer cheaper rates. 
And here I am in Rome and because I missed my flight (Paris to Rome), I have to pay 250 euros / person penalty or buy new tickets i already bought ! 
I didn‚Äôt choose to miss my flight. It has already cost me new tickets. In addition to that Airfrance doesn‚Äôt provide any help or empathy and this Airline gives you no choice but to pay again !!
And the reason: i should have told them : ‚Äú oh btw , i made it to Rome so don‚Äôt cancel my return ticket !!! ‚Äú 

This is no customer service ! 
They are happy to contact you and tell you how much you have to pay more but you don‚Äôt get any messages or emails asking you why you missed your flight ? and to warn you about the cancellation policy  ?!?

Nothing to shout about,Singapore,Paris,International,"Long haul flight, the inflight entertainment system consists mainly of French flights, not many recent English or Chinese movies. Really boring.

Service quality from cabin crew is nothing to shout about, just serve and go. With exception to a lady crew who came to top up my champagne without me asking. Yes, the champagne is nice.

I almost missed my dinner during night flight back to Singapore. Told the crew and he served my my dinner, but never bring any beverage or wine to go with it. I thought the service is not good.

Flight cancelled at the last minute. Then CHAOS !!,New York City,Paris,International,"Flight cancelled at the last minute. Then had to change terminal to see if Delta were going to take us home(Delta is a partner airline). Finally (all through our own initiatives - already difficult for an english-speaker but what would it have been like for someone who didn't speak very good english ? Horrendous !!) we managed to get 5 boarding passes marked ""Seat Request"" clearly indicating that we didn't yet have seats and that this would be confirmed at the gate !! Finally we left for Frankfurt (!!) - we arrived on time - then followed a 5 hour wait for an onward flight to Paris where we arrived exhausted.

Happy with the overall service,Paris,Buenos Aires,International,"It was my first experience with Air France... so far nothing to complaint about.

Insurance WARNING,New York City,Paris,International,"Although I have found flying business class on Air France to be an exceptional flying experience, purchasing tickets online has one great pitfall.   

I am writing this as a warning so that others don‚Äôt get trapped as I did.

I Purchased a business class ticket on Air France online for Bucharest. I purchased insurance for the flight at the same time on the Air France website, which was included in the overall price that I paid to Air France.

Several hours later I realized that the flight to Paris went to Orly and I had two hours to collect my luggage and get to Charles de Gaulle airport for the flight to Bucharest.  Being 77 and having had recent cardiac surgery, I knew that I would never make the connection.

Since we were within the 24 hour grace period, I called Air France to cancel the ticket and was told that everything was fine and the money would be refunded to my credit card within 10-15 business days.  I then rebooked my flight, flying from New York to Charles de Gaulle airport.   

About one month later I received an email from Air France saying that they needed written confirmation from the insurance company that they had not re-paid me for my flight.  Although the insurance was purchased on the Air France website in conjunction with my ticket, it was a separate insurance company Allianz Global Assistance. 

When I called them I was told that as a matter of policy they will not issue a written statement but Air France was free to call them and they would tell them that nothing was paid to me. They also told me that all claims had to be made within 10 days of the flight so that I could not file a claim with them.

I have made multiple calls to Air France and to the insurance company, being told that Air France must have a written statement and by the insurance company that the policy is they will not issue a written statement. Have friends who refused to call the insurance company.  Months of emails and written letters to Air France have gone unanswered.

After 16 months I have given up, but wanted to share this experience so that hopefully no one would be caught in the same trap that I was.

WARNING: IF YOU WANT TO PURCHASE TRAVEL INSURANCE DO NOT GET IT ONLINE WHEN YOU BUY YOUR TICKET.  PURCHASE IT DIRECTLY FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY.   AND DO NOT WAIT TO FILE A CLAIM.",2018-12,2019-04-03,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

Disappointment for gluten free travellers!,Paris,Fort-de-France,International,"We were flying from Paris to Martinique to celebrate my wife's 60 th birthday with a special holiday.  My wife suffers from an intolerance to wheat and gluten and as these items can make her very ill, we took the opportunity to order her a special onboard meal that was gluten free.  When the time arrived we were horrified that the special meal that arrived for her was actually frozen.  We immediately asked why this was and were told that that was how it was supposed to be!  Irritated at the response, we asked if it could be warmed and we were told that there were no warming facilities on the plane.  Other travellers were being given hot food, so why was it my wife could not have hers warmed in the same way?  It was then suggested that we had a normal hot meal and left anything that may contain gluten!  This we had to do reluctantly, so that she had something to eat on the 9 hour flight.
We later complained to the head of the flight attendants and she said that she would put in a report as we had not been well treated by the staff.
After arriving in Martinique, I again complained online to Air France and received an apology and we each received a 50 euro voucher to spend at some time on a flight with Air France.  We were happy to get the response, but very disappointed that such a thing should happen with this airline.  We await our treatment for our return flight!  Of course, it does mean we have to take another flight with Air France!",2019-03,2019-04-02,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0

When you do get served water, or coffee, or any other beverage, it comes in a cup the size of those at water fountains. The service is only twice during a 10-hour flight.

I was denied boarding at the Gate due to overbooking,Atlanta,Paris,International,"I was flying was Air France, fliI was denied boarding at the gate even though I had a ticket. I originally booked my flight with Lufthansa. After my original flight was canceled, I was booked to an AirFrance flight by Lufthansa agents that departs for CDG from ATL at 8:25 pm on March 1st, 2019. I was able to check in online successfully, along with a note that says I will receive my seat number at the gate. When I arrived at the gate 2 hours before the flight took off, I was told by the agent that the flight is full and I was on standby, even though I had a ticket. Very soon, I found out that there are 8 passengers in total who were on standby tickets without knowing so, and were transferred to AirFrance one way or another. Eventually, the flight took off with 7 of us remaining on the ground. The agents at the gate as well as the gentleman in a red jacket (we were told he was the manager) were extremely rude to all the passengers and spoke to us like it is our fault that we were on standby without knowing because we had our tickets. They were never once apologetic, appeared not knowing the procedures, and told me and another passenger that since Lufthansa booked our tickets with AirFrance, it is not their problem that we did not get on the flight. If you can't guarantee a seat, don't sell the tickets! I travel international multiple times per year, and never had contact with such rude airline members and been denied boarding at the gate! This is my first experience with AirFrance, and it is such a shame that a big airline like AirFrance displays this extent of disregard to its passengers.",2019-03,2019-04-02,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Not the best Premium Economy we`ve flown.,Paris,Taipei,International,"We`ve flown four round trips Premium Economy, two with Virgin, one with Thomas Cook and one with Air France. The best was Thomas Cook, the worst of the three airlines was Air France. This may be because Thomas Cook only do Economy and Premium, and therefore treat their Premium Economy customers as something special. Air France do Business and First as well so maybe that`s why they treat their Premium Economy customers like Economy passengers.

Positives :

The seat is bigger with more leg room. 
The seat is a shell type (good - the passenger in front can`t pinch your space, bad - the recline isn`t that good)
You get priority check in, security clearance, boarding and luggage.

Negatives :

As far as I could tell EVERYTHING else is as per Economy. 
The same food and drink (with Air France there isn`t even a welcome drink as you board the plane), the same service, and even, incredibly, the same toilets..... We were told we had to go all the way to the back of the plane (to the Economy toilets, negotiating, if possible all the trollies blocking the aisles) rather than being advised of the Business class toilets just in front of us !

I couldn't believe it!  Apparently, Air France doesn't deliver lost luggage in Morocco. Not only did I have to go get it myself (which is a great hassle because you can't just take a taxi, since no cars are alowed within the medina walls), but they couldn't guarantee any time frame, which meant I had to cancel my plans for the day.  I also ended up having to go to the airport TWICE to get it because I didn't have my passport on me the first time - something they neglected to tell me I'd need.

What was positive was the level of care the hosts demonstrated towards the passengers. This is what I believe is a crucial differentiator and sets Air France from its competitors.

Not satisfied,Fort-de-France,Helsinki,International,"Air France is not able to arrange seats together for people travelling together. My husband got a seat from totally other part of the plain. However he was more lucky than I. I was sitting in between two gentlemen who both seemed to suffer from a flu. The other one used a white  cover on mouth  but the other one was coughing more or less the whole 8 hours. I asked  the air hostess if it would be possible to change the place. Probable it was not because she didn‚Äôt show up again. I od course got the flu and havetried to cover from it for two weeks. Nice!
We had one piece of extra luggage to check in. It cost 40 ‚Ç¨ from Helsinki to Martinique and the other way from Martinique to Helsinki 60‚Ç¨. Makes no sense. They even tried to get an additional payment for Paris Helsinki. We refused. A lot of telephone calls were made but luckily we didn‚Äôt need to pay anything extra.
The plains are old. Seats are very uncomfortable. Screens are really small like a stamp and do not work propely.
Airconditioning was faint if any. I almost considered asking extra oxygen mask.
Best thing to mention was the small bottle of Martinique rum with food.",2019-03,2019-03-28,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0819906910132473
Dreadful return flight,Shanghai,Manchester,International,"I don't get it, I just don't get it...Air France is owned by the same company that owns KLM, yet KLM were excellent on the flight out to Shanghai, on the return flight with Air France it was almost appalling.  
Check in was fine and the seat was okay with enough legroom.  In flight entertainment was good and things were clean.  Where it all went wrong was that the flight attendants were perfectly fine for about two hours and then they suddenly got arsey and uninterested in the passengers.  Then the 'food' came and it was awful, even more awful than a pre-packed 59p frozen meal from Heron Foods.  I tried to eat it but just couldn't...and as for breakfast, it was simply vile...so the whole 12 hours I didn't eat.
Very unimpressed and will avoid using Air France in the future and stick to their sister company KLM.",2019-02,2019-03-27,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0
"Not as bad as I expected, and I was ready to write something terrible!",San Francisco,Milan,International,"About 15 years ago, I flew Air ""Chance"" (sometimes vee fly, and sometimes vee don't) back from my other home in Italy, and the food service workers were on strike, as in one brown paper bag of food, even for First Class, and no help in the cabin. By sheer luck on this trip, the AF workers were on strike between my incoming and outgoing flights, and everything was tranquil for me. I had 4 segments in 3 terminals and went to 3 VIP lounges, and the lounges do vary from location to location. I am a loyal Delta Platinum Member, but just another chump on Air France, and I sat in row 31. Boarding for partner VIP members is allowed and well done. I have to say that the food is pretty good in their lounges. One lounge had 5 choices of premium pour-it-yourself wine, and I saw a Saint-Emilion Reserve and didn't even look at the other bottles. Yum, yum! 3 of 4 airplanes were pretty new, and one smaller plane smelled funky. The trans-Atlantic planes seat 10 across, and legroom is marginal. Movies system worked well and there was maybe an inch more legroom than Alitalia, but nothing like the Delta Comfort that I use for no extra cost. I booked Alitalia last year and Air France this year, always through Delta, to save up to six and a half hours of travel time, and the prices were good, too. I am a little bit worried about a lack of security checks with Air France, but it sure was easy. I will also add that France is the melting pot of Europe, and the type of travelers on their planes may be different than we are used to seeing, if you know what I mean. I love my Delta and can't wait to fly them again, but I will certainly check Air France to save both travel time and money, in the future.",2019-03,2019-03-27,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

Uncomfortable Seats,San Francisco,Paris,International,"I have to agree with other reviewers who say the seats are uncomfortable.  They are so uncomfortable, I would not pay the premium price to upgrade again.  I've traveled in premium economy with other airlines and there is a big difference in comfort.  However, there are pluses to flying in this cabin.  You can select your meals from a special premium economy menu, enjoy faster check-in using the business class line, board early, sit with fewer passengers, watch movies on a larger screen with noise cancelling headphones, and you get more elbow room.  If that's worth the price tag, then go for it.

Our return trip was almost a disaster.  There was a problem with my ticket.  My husband's was fine and we booked both tickets together.

Never again...,Paris,Mahebourg,International,"We took a flight to Mauritius from CDG and return with the same company ( flights AF0460, AF0463 13th - 25th March) please avoid! It seems that Air France is cutting costs on the most basic services: food (pasta with potato salad), aircraft staff ( one steward serving in the cabin on one aisle) aircraft comfort- the plane was old on both traveling ways, the screens were not working properly, coming out of the seat support, the movies and the entertainment part was not working either, it felt that the whole aircraft didn‚Äôt have a serious maintenance for quite some time. This is not the feeling that you want to have while traveling overseas on a 11h flight. The stewards were nice but there was no organization at all from entering to the aircraft until serving the meals. We received breakfast with 45 min before landing to Mauritius- people were still eating when the captain announced the landing and we were given the paperwork for the immigration office.

The most distressing part was when we returned and landed to CDG in terminal 2E and connecting with terminal 2F at 5 am - this is when Air France staff confused everyone where to go and it was literally everyone running in front of everyone, pure chaos at the security check.

"Rude, arrogant, unhelpful crew and an old flying sardine box as a transport",Fort-de-France,Trondheim,International,"The lack of service within AF, the arrogance of staff, the transportation between airports and the fact that our 4-year-old got pretty hurt ending up in severe nose bleed due to a very bad and aggressive bus driver, with not even a trace of help to find from AF. And letting a family being stranded for 24 hours without even providing a hotel? Speechless! You should be ashamed Air France!

AF841/20MAR FDF-ORY
-seats 17 ABC, in flight entertainment not working on all the 3 screens, brought to the attention of a very unwillingly, unhelpful and rude flight attendant. 30 min. and 2 flight attendants later the systems were restarted, unfortunately without any success. No follow up by your crew. A 9-hour flight with a 4 year old and no entertainment, a first timer for us. We have never seen so unhelpful crew during our many travels.
-Shower! During take off I got a shower, assuming water as a result of condensation? Coming out of a ceiling light, dripping down on me. As a result, my t-shirt was wet, to be more precise, the whole right side of my shirt and the seat were now wet. I brought this to one of the attendant‚Äôs attention, with a amusing answer. That was normal she said and went away. Not even listening or offering any kind of towels or blankets or at least an apology! So, for our next travel on AF we should bring umbrellas perhaps?
-Seats. This must be the industry‚Äôs worst, oldest, most worn out and tightest seats! I have never seen anything more uncomfortable than your flying sardine box used for this flight. Disgusting!
-Food. Please reconsider your portions and quality of food, this is rather ridiculous. Small servings, ice cold bread and very little to choose from.
-Service. I understand AF is doing the ‚Äúwe are here for your safety‚Äù thing, but seriously, there is a total lack of customer service and crew is rather rude and arrogant, not even close to service minded. If you want to stay in the industry you should really pick up your game. On a 9-hour flight I went myself to get my own coffee, or at least I tried, and was told of to wait for the second service which will start in about 30 min. Really?
-Breakfast. When we finally got the so called breakfast, we were informed that we had 20 min to eat and drink up. Wow, speechless, again.

Arrival at ORY
-Waiting for more than 1 hour for our luggage.
-Bus tickets to CDG. Where could we possibly get them? Ask some staff in the arrivals, wait, there was nobody. Went up to the AF ticket desk (this is where I got them at CDG!) to be told no, they don‚Äôt do this here at ORY and I had to go to arrivals. I informed them that there was nobody, but this was not their problem of course.  After some searching, I found a AF lost and found office and finally I could get those bus tickets. Your information around the obtaining of these tickets is ridiculously poor and I cannot understand why this is not provided in the ticket.
-Bus. Huge queue, we made it on the 3rd bus luckily. The driver was probably angry with the traffic, which was bad, and drove very aggressively, sudden accelerations and sudden hard breaking, absolutely unnecessary aggressive driving behaviour. This behaviour resulted in our 4-year-old hitting her head and nose on seat and window, resulting In severe nose bleed. Let me tell you, AF staff was not even slightly interested to listen to us or helping us. This again shows the arrogance which we met all the way. Shame!

CDG
-Our flight, AF1640/21MAR was long gone and we were redirected to the manual check in. Here we were told to take the next plane, which was starting boarding as we spoke. Boarding passes were issued, and I allowed myself to ask if we would be able to make our connection in AMS. That was not the lady‚Äôs problem of course, how could I. We just had to run to the gate we were told, which we did.
-At the gate we realized that we had 3 different seats, far from each other, meaning that our nose-bleeding 4-year-old will be sitting alone, beside a male stranger. As we all know, this is against aviation law, so I approached the gate staff. No surprise I was told off again, we just had to take those seats because the aircraft is full. I brought my daughters age to the staff‚Äôs attention with no effect, its either that or we are not going anywhere. She now added they will try to solve the seating issue on board.

Onboard AF 1740/21MAR
The cabin crew was not happy that we did not have the right seats and the discussion started all over again. We were then told that we had to talk to passengers ourselves. Shocking. We convinced 1 lady to swap seat with my wife so she could sit with our daughter.

AMS
-Arriving late in AMS, we ran to our next gate in hope to catch the connecting flight to TRD.
-We arrived at the departure gate 11 minutes prior to scheduled departure, but there was no one to be seen in the gate. We saw the aircraft and our 3 bags nicely aligned in front of it. With other words, we were offloaded already before we even arrived.
-Contacting the transfer desk and being told that all flights were full, booked on the same flight the next day.
-Asked for a hotel and was told of course, we will be provided a hotel. However, after a phone call to her supervisor the lady tells us no, she cannot provide the hotel and we had to pay ourselves and claim it from AF later on. We didn‚Äôt even receive an IRR kit and had to buy our toothbrushes, toiletries and some clothes for the next day. How can that be?

The French know how to pack ‚Äòem in,Atlanta,Paris,International,"I won‚Äôt be too harsh here, as the economy class food was actually quite good. But overall the flight was very cramped and my carry on was nabbed while boarding in ATL.  It seems that the first class and other priority boarders had filled the compartments and those of us in the tail end had to sacrifice. Frankly, I didn‚Äôt care if the bag was checked, so I willingly gave it up. But I‚Äôve flown enough to know what happens when bags are hastily checked. Sure enough, when we arrived at CDG and boarded our connecting flight to Berlin there were all three of our bags laid out on the tarmac with 5 men jabbering into their radios and scratching their heads. I advised one of the crew that those were our bags and they needed to be on our plane to meet us at our final destination.  He very politely told me that they had it well in hand.  After being seated I asked another crew member about the status of the bags and she advised me that we had only paid to check 2 bags and not 3. I offered to pay her on the spot if it meant the bags would follow us to Berlin. She rather rudely retorted to never mind, as ‚Äúit was too late to do that anyway.‚Äù  Guess what? We were one bag light of a full load when we arrived in Berlin. To the airline‚Äôs credit, the bag arrived at our hotel the next day, totally intact. This is a classic allegory of contemporary commercial flight. Overbooked, overcrowded, and mistakes happen.

MISSING LUGGAGE,Aberdeen,Port of Spain,International,"My son travelled with Air France on the 12/03/19 from Aberdeen Airport to CDG Paris then onto Miami to reach his final destination the following day at the Port of Spain only to find out his suitcase was not on the flight.

My son is unable to keep in touch with Air France so it is up to me to communicate with them as he is working on a cargo ship for 3/4 months without his belongings.

On Wednesday evening I was informed from a member of staff that the suitcase was located in New York and he would personally follow this up to ensure that the suitcase would arrive at the Port of Spain. I asked if he would update this information on the file and I would phone again the following day. When I phoned the following day this information was not confirmed on the file and the suitcase was not located in New York after all.
At the end of each conversation then I phone hey say that ‚Äúthey are waiting for confirmation from JFK New York‚Äù They say that they cannot telephone JFK New York Airport directly. Why not?

Damaged Luggage,Tokyo,Paris,International,"Part 2 of my previous review 'Inhumane Experience'.

The nightmare seems to never end with Air France!

When arriving in Paris, from Japan, upon collecting my brand new luggage, I noticed that it had been damaged so I spoke to the baggage control desk and they informed me that I could file a claim online through Air France website.

1 day after arrival, on the 26th February, I had filed a claim and was notified that it could take up to 21 days. On the 12th of March, I decided to follow up and was notified that the original claim had gone missing and was asked to submit a new claim...

It gets even better!
Last week, I received an email from Air France's support team advising me that they are sorry for the 16 hour wait which I had to endure during my recent trip from Amsterdam to London! 
1. I have never been to Amsterdam in my life
2. I had previously been told that the issue regarding my 16 hour wait was not their responsibility (refer to my previous review).
3. Once again, no acknowledgement of my damaged luggage

I called customer support once again to advise them of the above and I was told that the issue would be escalated. Within minutes I received the exact same email regarding the 16 hour wait! I called again and once again was told that the issue would be escalated. FUN TIMES!

To cut a long story short, this morning I received an email advising that they were sorry to hear that my luggage was damaged during my trip from Paris to Malta and although the flights were booked through Air France, I should contact the airline which actually operated the flight (at this point I just wanted to give up)...
1. My luggage was damaged during my flight from Japan to Paris, which was operated by Air France
2. Why did it take them 1 month to tell me this?
3. I've probably spent more money on phone calls, not to mention the time, than the actual cost of my luggage",2019-02,2019-03-23,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0
The worst experience so far,Miami,Paris,International,"I travel a lot, and thing happen, but what happened today was a 3 hr delay from Mia, due to some mistake someone did on the parking lot, which i did not understand, since there was not always translated in english when captain was talking, and when he was, staff was talking to eachother so loud that i did not hear him, which is a safety hazard! They were not able to say time of a delay, it all started at the airport, a mess, no organization, obviously their gate was changed, and they ‚Äúwere not familiar with it‚Äù. They were keep on missleading us with times of arrival, and they promised assirance ar the arrival to CDG-noone was there to tell us where to go, no costumer service, since my connecting flight was just departing when I landed. So finally i managed to catch a random employee who pointed me where to go. At service desk, the lady tried to be helpful, booked me on a late night flight, and was not able to change arrival airport to my final destination which would be equvavilent to the one i had which i missed because of the delay.

Don't fly Air France,Washington DC,Paris,International,"Bottom line - The staff working Air France were all very kind but they will not follow through with any of their promises. They lost my luggage for the entirety of my week-long trip and every day I called them and they promised that ""my luggage would arrive between 4pm and 7pm that day and they would give me a call to confirm that it had been delivered"". After the first time it wasn't delivered, they claimed that ""my luggage did not get on the transport's vehicle for the day"". Okay, that's fine, I still have 6 more days to get my luggage for at least SOME of my trip. Day after day, they promised that my luggage would be delivered, and failed to do so. I finally gave up on getting my luggage for my trip, but I asked them to just hold my luggage at the airport so that I could at least have it on my flight home. I arrived at the airport, and again, no luggage. I'm not sure if their internal communication is just nonexistent, or if the people I was talking to were completely incompetent, but they sure made it seem like they were ""trying their best to locate my luggage"", without doing anything at all it seems. I still do not have my luggage 8 days later, and I'm honestly not too hopeful I will ever get it back. I've heard horror stories of people losing their luggage and I honestly didn't believe them. NOW I BELIEVE THEM. Don't fly Air France unless you carry-on all of your luggage. The flight attendants were extremely pleasant and this review does not reflect the service onboard the plane at all. Their baggage service is a disgrace and their customer service representatives do not follow through.",2019-03,2019-03-22,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0

The drawback was the flight temperature as it was freezing once we achieved cruising altitude and upon arrival in Havana and the return to Birmingham we had colds which took a week to clear up which spoilt our trip.

Once in a while - this was it,Paris,Johannesburg,International,"Flying on the Airbus 380 I managed to secure a seat right at the back on the upper deck in economy class.  The flight was not very full and the cabin crew fully encouraged us to take full advantage of this fact.  They had the same 'giddy' excitement the passengers had - you know the one when you realise that the empty seat next to you is likely to stay that way for the next 10 hours... They immediately after boarding encouraged us to move around to find the most comfortable configuration.  My previous experiences on other airlines were quite different.  You could also see that they worked together to make sure that it did not end in a 'land grab' but rather that everybody got some advantage from the situation.  Furthermore, they were fairly generous with the amenities (not to the extent that will cause problems), but just... generous.  
I fly a lot and this was such a refreshing experience that I had to give cudo's.  Sometimes the crew don't appreciate what a huge difference their attitude make to the overall experience.  Well done!!!",2019-03,2019-03-21,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0
Great Airline,New Delhi,Paris,International,Travelled on Air France after a really long time. The business class section is very comfortable.

Comme ci comme √ßa,Johannesburg,Amsterdam,International,"First of all the attendants were all spectacular. And who can argue with good French wine almost anytime you want it.
But the seat cushioning is worn and consequently, uncomfortable for a very long flight. The procedure for getting admitted into the plane from Johannesburg to Paris leg of the flight was Byzantine. First the ask you to leave your seat and then set up a parameter about the size of a tennis court outside of the gate. They then position a gate attendant to check passports outside of this parameter to essentially let you back into the seating area that they just asked you to leave. Heaven forbid if you have to go to the bathroom during this period. You‚Äôll have to again show your passport and boarding pass. For the attendants it is a purely perfunctory exercise yet robotically they do it.
I should also point out that the food on the flight was great. The attendants do everything in their power to ameliorate the fatigue that comes with long travel. But there are some bugs in the system that warrant attention.",2019-03,2019-03-21,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,1.0,4.0

Never Again Air France,Washington DC,Paris,International,"This Review on behalf of my sister.  Her flight back to Europe from Dulles International was with Air France to Paris.  She described the trip as totally uncomfortable because the seats are narrow, the actual seat tips forward. Impossible to sit up without reclining because you feel like you are sliding out of your seat, however, she was unable to recline because the back of her seat was against the wall.  Her entire trip was with a small pillow tucked under her legs, so she did not slip forward.  She also described to me that the food was disgusting.  When she picked up her luggage it was torn and may have lost some of the contents.   I am not sure how Air France can continue long international flights with such uncomfortable accommodations.  Not to mention the additional high costs for luggage that they destroyed.",2019-03,2019-03-20,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

Vive la France!,Manchester,Cairo,International,"I travel to Cairo fairly frequently and following the cessation of direct flights from Manchester, have been offered a myriad of providers, routing me via Istanbul, Schipol, Charles de Gaulle etc. I must say that without fear of contradiction, my recent flight with Air France, operated by Joon was the best. 

I understand this arm of Air France is a relatively small concern, but in my opinion compact and bijou! 

There are articles that the millennials ‚Äòdon‚Äôt get it‚Äô and I must admit the avant garde safety video was strange, though clearly had its effect as it was memorable! For me, the smart casual appearance of the crew (think dark blue Fred Perry type tops, close fit beige / khaki chinos, with white tennis shoes) was a welcome change and all of them, both outbound and inbound were polite, courteous and incredibly helpful. 

Even flying in Economy, a larger person such as myself (5‚Äô10‚Äù 18Stone) has ample chair and leg room; something their competitors lack! This could have been due to the relative newness of the fleet, or the Airbus A340 which was used for the longer leg from CdG to CAI. A slightly smaller A320 for the MAN to CdG hop. This was nonetheless ample in space for myself and others. 

Food was tasty, though suffered from the age old problem of not being as warm as it might be, though given they are catering for up to 300 passengers plus crew at 38,000 feet, a degree of latitude is called for. Fresh fruit juices, sodas, water, hot drinks and a range of alcohol was available to accompany your meal, and indeed flight. As mentioned before, the crew could not have been more accommodating.

For future trips to Cairo, I shall certainly be choosing Air France / Joon and totting up the points on my Flying Blue registration!

Vive la difference! üá´üá∑

Flight attendants were ok, not overly happy to be doing this route. Overall I was glad it was a quick easy flight. 

My Flight from Paris to Beirut was much better .Again I had a business class ticket and  as soon as I entered the plane I was shocked to see a full business class seat with its own storage space and a fully reclining chair.( I have attached a picture). Again, the plane could have been cleaner. fingerprints were all over the screen and small closet where you store your items had some leftover stuff from the previous traveler.  Entertainment was plenty and the staff was quite pleasant. The food was not that great, but I was extremely happy with the space and the entertainment.

Also, I'd explained to service staff at CDG that I'd missed my connection and couldn't contact my husband who was waiting to collect me from my ongoing flight to Nantes and asked them if they could contact Nantes Atlantique Airport simply to page him after my non-arrival and reassure him I was to be on the next flight. At first they said they couldn't but when I explained he was 77 and had just had heart surgery AND would be worried they said they'd email the service desk at Nantes. I later discovered that no email had been sent. It was merely said to me to appease me. ANOTHER LIE. How unprofessional?

"Just ok flight, personnel hit or miss (really rude)",Frankfurt,Lima,International,"...booked the flight via KLM (carried out by AirFrance) as it is the fastest way to get from FRA to LIM. Positive: the transfer in CDG was pretty uncomplicated and without any long lines. 
Also, I was lucky enough to have a seat with a lot of legroom for the long flight...but that was pretty much it on the positive side... the service was a roulette - one of the stewardesses (the boss) was the unfriendliest person you can imagine! 

Some negative highlights:
No way to charge your phone in economy! 
Movies - only 2 good ones 
Screen and sound - very 90ies
Toilet - no water to wash your hands in the one directly in front of me...just bottles of water...
And the worst: after the very nice Stewardess had allowed me to charge my phone in the business class, the mean one almost yelled at me for ‚Äútrespassing‚Äù, claiming she was the boss and the other stewardess ‚Äúhad nothing to say‚Äú...

Flight from Athens to Havana and Rio to Athens,Athens,Havana,International,Traveled 2 times by Airfrance to Central and South America. The Airfrance is very good company.

Nothing premium in premium economy,Miami,Paris,International,"Booking a flight on Air France, I already had expectations that this would be a little bit better than other carriers.  I also expected that Premium Economy would be a more enjoyable experience.  About the only positive thing I can say is that the 2-3-2 seat arrangement gives more width and a leg rest along with the foot rest.  

It started at check in at the Miami Airport - for some reason I could not understand, the Sky Priority line which they tout as being an expedited experience took longer than the standard check in line.  Eventually they opened some additional check in desks but by then I had already watched people who arrived after me head off to the security check point.  

Ahh yes, the security check point for Terminals H and J at MIA.  There is one very long line and even if have TSA Pre-Check, forget about it.  It seems that everyone goes through standard screening here as there is no separate Pre-Check line to be seen.  

Once I got to my gate, Air France, or MIA, not sure which, has seen fit to have five gates all located with a single seating area and lots of empty space.  There are obviously not enough chairs for all the passengers going out of these gates and there are no electrical outlets or USB ports in sight.  

When we finally boarded I was hopeful that I would be able to finally recharge my phone at my seat using the promised power outlet and USB port.  Alas, neither functioned properly.  My friendly cabin attendant offered another seat where I promptly discovered that the outlets there did absolutely nothing as well.

As I mentioned, the seats in Premium Economy on the Airbus 380 are arranged 2-3-2 which does provide a wider seat =, greater pitch (the distance between you and the seat in front of you) and a leg rest when you recline.  However, reclining is barely anything and the greater pitch was kind of unnecessary given how little the seats go back.  This coupled with the very uncomfortable seat cushion and I got no rest on my flight.  The headphones for the entertainment system also only had a cushion/padding for one of the two ear pieces.  

Okay, but at least they serve better food in Premium Economy, right?  Wrong.  The entree choice consisted of a pasta with cheese sauce or chicken in a balsamic cream served with polenta and spinach. Sounded good.  About 3 small bites of chicken in some kind of creamy sauce, polenta with corn niblets cooked into it and where was the spinach?  The best part of the tray was the chocolate cake.  Mousse like on top, cake on the bottom, meringue in the middle.  The roll served with dinner was hard and cold.  I'm not sure why they came around to offer more rolls.  We were never offered a second beverage.  

All in all, it was not a very peasant flight although, we did arrive safely.",2019-03,2019-03-14,2.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0

Inhumane Experience,Tokyo,Valletta,International,"I booked my flights through Air France and on my return, I had to transfer from Charles De Gaulle (CDG) to Orly (ORY) in order to catch my flight home. Little had I known, Air France had booked a flight which was impossible for me to make on time, not even Jesus himself would have managed. 

We landed in CDG at 15:46.
Luggage collected at 16:12 (yes, I had to also collect my luggage)
Next available shuttle bus at 17:00 (as per schedule)
As per shuttle website, transfer takes between 1hr10min and 1hr20min
Arrived at Orly Airport at 18:16
Arrived at check in desk at 18:20 and was told that it was too late to check in any luggage
Flight was scheduled to depart at 18:55

Kindly note that there were no delays or anything, the above times are all realistic.

I was then booked on an alternative flight, the following day at 10:55am, from CDG! 
Air France did not offer any food or drink vouchers, they did not even refund my bus ticket from CDG to ORY, and worst of all is, I was left waiting in CDG airport overnight for over 16 hours until my flight home - no compensation whatsoever was rewarded.

One of their agents told me that the 3 hours of the minimum connection time include the check-in of the luggage at Orly and also the time when the check-in desk is closed, which is ridiculous to say the least.
So, basically I had 3 hours + 9 minutes to arrive from Paris Charles de Gaulle to Orly, including check-in closure time. 

As you can note, the airline books connecting flights blindly without taking into consideration the shuttle schedule and so on. They cover their own asses by giving the passengers 3 hours to transfer from one airport to the other, but they do not consider the times at which the buses run or the time it takes to disembark from the aeroplane on landing, they are covered as long as have a minimum of 3 hours from landing to departure. In my case, I landed at CDG at 15:46 and my flight departed from ORY at 18:55 (3 hours and 9 minutes) - THEY WIN",2019-02,2019-03-13,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0

"Cancelled flight,confused desk assistant, chaos at Orly post security menace, will not even mention poor food or chair",Prague,Pointe-a-Pitre,International,"Our initial flight to a connection towards Caribbean through Paris was cancelled - as an irony we got the cancellation sms after few min earlier we were offered to check in for free extra luggage ... In that moment you realize that AF opens its help desk at 8:30 only regardless you need a solution upfront. Good luck to get an answer by messenger or FB. We decided to get in airport and find alternative flights - we spent 1 hour at desk with a lady who had no idea where Guadeloupe was - she was googling while talking to us - suppose if you work at a AF desk you should know some of its really popular destinations. All in one after support from her manager we got an alternative flight from our initial destination to Guadeloupe with a day delay which already costs us paid days of vacations cancelled hotel and so on.
Flight second day through Orly and we are again in the middle of action with a suspect package on aircraft. The security in airport had a very strange approach to the situation - we were gathered for an hour or so in the tiny shops space at the terminal just to be requested after all to exit anyway that place. No proper air, no place to sit, no water as the counter in Relay and the bar were closed. All the communication was done by people shouting no megaphone or a way to actually communicate efficiently and loud. This just created more panic through people as they simply didn't heard what was communicated. I`m not even saying about non french speakers - we met another couple who didn't spoke French and they were just in total confusion as no communication was run in English. Finally back to enter the terminal the hand luggage security lady was very aggressive, my kids almost started to cry when she started to shout with no reason. All in one we were just grateful we are out of there and the plane was cleared and was ok. When you experience such situation if the security people cannot inspire calm then the problems just get worse...

Worst airline ever?,Manchester,Johannesburg,International,The ticket prices were very reasonable.  Took shuttle flight to Paris then long haul to Jo‚Äôburg. The long haul flight was on Airbus 380 but it was the worst leg room (and seat tilt back) I have ever experienced on long haul flight.  The cabin staff were fine but the food very poor and breakfast totally inedible. I thought the French were famous for their food?  The entertainment system was very outdated and choice of films poor.,2019-02,2019-03-10,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0

I can never understand people's hurry, seatbelt off before plan lands, locker open, massive bag(s) out and wanting off the plane before the door is even open, not happy if it's not done quick enough, then they need to wait at the carousel. You have got to laugh some times you really do. I know this happens on most flights and I can't quite put my finger on why it stuck out so much on this one but it did, and it did in a big way!!!

A380 Airbus from CDG to ORT,London,Johannesburg,International,"In general, I am not a particularly good flyer.  I flew Air France from Heathrow to Charles de Gaulle, Paris, and was impressed with the friendly and relaxed (and attractive) cabin crew, and the service provided.  At CDG, I transferred to Air France 
A380, and, imagine my surprise when everyone was seated, that the female voice which came over the intercom was the Captain, and she further announced that it was an all-female flight crew.  Being somewhat chauvenistic, I was a little taken-aback by this news.  However, I am thrilled to report that the take-off was the smoothest I have ever experienced, so much so that it took me a while to realise that we were already in the air.  I would say, too, that the flight itself was the smoothest i have been on in 50 years of air travel.  My clincher was that my suitcase had been severely damaged.  I entered into correspondence with Air France over the matter, and had excellent customer support from their staff.  I cannot speak too highly of them.

Typical of many European Airlines, except for very long flights, ""business class"" means regular seating at the front with an empty seat between you (although there is upgraded service). My main complaint about flying into and out of CDG is the frequent requirement to take a shuttle to the terminal from a remote location. I figured flying AF that wouldn't be a problem, but, sure enough, our full A-330 was parked remotely and shuttled in. The flight to Rabat was fine.

Definitely PE seats are small as in Economy. They are slightly larger but as far as leg space is concerned it is the same : nothing. To talk about the reclining of the seats : it's a joke! You stay seated upright all night. It was a real red eye flight!

Airbus A380-800 looks like a 20 years plane inside. Chairs, colours and monitors reminds me old 747`s.

Long layover at CDG - sprang for a reasonable upgrade to Air France business,Paris,Atlanta,International,"I purchased a round-trip to Stockholm with short notice and the best price was through Delta - with the overseas portions operated by Air France.  Both ways had long (> 5 hour) layovers at Paris (CDG).  They were offering a relatively cheap (~350 USD) upgrade to business on my return flight.  I was celebrating the start of a new job and decided to splurge (on my dime) for the lounge access for the layover and the comfort on the flight.  Both very nicely enhanced the ride home.  The Air France lounge is quite comfortable and well stocked with food, beverages, WiFi and power.  The business seats allow for a full recline which gave me my first genuine sleep on an transatlantic hop ever - I must say that it was wonderful.  The in-flight entertainment, cuisine and amenities were on par other business class flights I've taken in the past (when reward miles went much further).

Four flight segments and 17 hours of travel,Toronto,Bengaluru,International,"Our journey started on a heavy snow day in Toronto. Despite the inclement weather, with a short delay in loading food, the flight took off with only 30 minutes delay. There was a slight confusion at the check-in counters, but the overall boarding process was fairly smooth. The cabin crew was great; food was as expected, drinks (no hard liquor except after dinner cognac) started with a glass of champagne, then red or white wine. Cabin ambience was nothing much to brag about, but decent. The flight was uneventful, and on time.

We booked the Premium Economy tickets based on only one major criterion: the seat. The seat was wide, with ample legroom. However, it failed by design as it does not recline, the sliding down of the inside did cause lumbar issues including uncomfortable pain. It was so uncomfortable, I had to just sit straight during the entire flight. There is adjustable foot support, and leg support: despite the seat felt very badly. 

The flight from Paris to Bangalore felt different even though AF deploys the same kind of aircraft. It looks like an older plane, but the cabin ambiance matched the previous flight. This sector has more business class seats, and business class passengers. Thus, the premium economy seats were pushed further down to the almost center of the plane. The flight felt like slightly downgrade service from the food/beverages perspective. Crew were exemplary, food was OK as usual. The flight was on time.

Bangalore check in process was as smooth as it could be; thus kudos to the young person at the counter. The boarding process was also uneventful. Since it was ‚Äòred-eye‚Äô flight, after the dinner most of the passengers slept like logs. Breakfast served before landing in Paris. It was another on time performance, and a smooth one too.

The next segment, from Paris to YYZ, was good as well. Despite the snowstorm warning in Toronto, our flight took off as usual. Food, drinks, and the cabin service were at par, nothing outstanding, but met our expectations. The flight landed safely in the snowstorm, actually few minutes earlier. Our hats off to the pilot and the crew.

Airport Ground Staff Need Training,Los Angeles,Papeete,International,"We flew from LAX to Papeete in early February, 2019. Boarding was scheduled to begin at approximately 10:20pm. The check in didn‚Äôt open until about 8:10pm. We wound up standing in line waiting for an hour until they opened and started accepting check ins. During that wait, a gentleman who was obviously under the influence continuously staggered back and forth in front of the check in counters. No one from the airline or airport seemed to notice or care. An employee finally came out to begin checking passengers in and had some contact with the staggering gentleman. That gentleman then found a chair, sat down and promptly passed out. Still, no one did anything to deal with the problem. We then checked in and went to the lounge. The  lounge was very nice and had a decent selection of food and drink.
When it came time to board we walked to the gate only to find that there was some sort of delay. Sure enough, the staggering gentleman had made it to the gate area and again passed out. Boarding was delayed as the staff finally began to deal with the issue. They could not wake him and finally, after about 15 minutes of delay, called for EMS. The gate area personnel did not seem to know how to handle the situation. Police first arrived followed by EMS. They were unable to easily awaken the subject and wound up transporting him to a hospital. Boarding was delayed for the entire time. This person should have never made it past the check in area in his condition. How could they even consider boarding someone who was basically unconscious and obviously incapable of dealing with an eight hour flight? We overheard gate area staff say that the person had been checked by ambulance personnel earlier after we saw him unconscious prior to checking in.

The flight itself was fantastic! The flight attendants were friendly, professional and very attentive. We couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better crew on this flight. The food and drink was plentiful and very good. The inflight entertainment system was also very good.

"Something to improve, but good flight",Shanghai,Rome,International,"The flight was operated with an A380, a very large aircraft which allows space for short walks.

Fortunately, the crew was so kind to allow me to arrange it inside another locker in the rear. The level of the food served was over the average of European airlines, an aspect that I appreciated a lot. Good comfort quality of the seats.

Air France Connections Assistance desk passed the request for help dealing with the long layover (e.g. hotel room or meal vouchers) to the Departure Area Customer Service.

Truely awful on many levels,Bangkok,Paris,International,"At the gate looking at our plane to be told 15 minute delay then extended to two hour delay then five hours after departure time the flight was cancelled. Air France escorted us back through immigration to re-collect our luggage-- the last time we would see a representative. After 90 minutes in the baggage claim hall airport staff told us the carousel had changed to the opposite end of the hall and after everyone got their luggage nobody knew what was happening. A hotel employee then said we were all being bussed to their hotel which in rush hour took 2+ hours followed by a long wait to get booked in. No information from Air France to passengers or hotel no email or messages.Called airline and was put through to USA who told us to call back as computers down when we did they said flight left on time. Following morning made our own way back to airport by taxi at our expense so airport staff could re-book a flight via Doha with a 7 hour lay over. Arrived to our destination after 40 hour delay. We did get compensation although mine was paid into my husbands account and there was no communication from Air France throughout the claim. Would I fly with them again-- not unless they were the only option.
Also Edinburgh to Paris business class seat is 3 economy seats with a passenger at each side but with non moveable arm rests-- certainly below expectations by a long way.
The onboard attendants were very nice on all our flights but certainly on the long haul flights not as many in number as other carriers",2018-11,2019-02-27,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0

"Service has definitely improved, but AF needs to change their seats !",Hong Kong,Paris,International,"Lots of improvements can be noticed on the service side. The flight attendant are doing a good job in making sure you are comfortable. This is wonderful until you have reached your premium economy seat ! 
You paid a premium to have more leg room and especially a seat which is more comfortable. If the width is ok, the angle is terrible. The seats don't lay back, they slide down. The position is not natural and on top of it the angle is bad for your back.

AF is saying that new seats will be installed soon but they will still be sliding. Seriously, why would you pay a premium to feel uncomfortable. If you can't fly overpriced Business Class, you are better off paying for a regular coach seat. They are narrower but the angle is more comfortable. Come on AF, please get rid of these sliding seats.

We flew economy on the way over and premium economy on the way back. Paris to SXM- Great service, plenty of drinks, decent food, good (not great) entertainment selection, plenty of legroom (in the middle aisle). SXM to Paris (premium) Yes more leg room but that is basically it. Would not bother paying extra again. Didn't find any difference in the food (in fact it was worse on the way back really) again plenty of drinks and good service. 'Breakfast' not breakfast. Think we had a dry croissant and yogurt. But most importantly for us, it was comfortable, never crammed and the flight went by fast, which was great for long haul. Just fyi, CDG is a crazy place!!!

"Business Class Manchester, England to New York JFK",Manchester,New York City,International,"I was lucky to find a Buiness class return ticket via Paris for ¬£1300. As I was departing from Terminal 3 I was allowed access to the new 1903 lounge at Manchester Airport. This was very peaceful at 7am and I took advantage of a hot breakfast and free drinks. The connecting flight used a standard Airbus A330 with a separate cabin for Business Class with standard seating but the middle seat is kept empty. Breakfast inc hot croissant was served on the short flight to Paris CDG. 
Connecting at CDG was easy. The lounge was busy and could have done with extra staff to clear plates but once a couple of flights had departed it settled down. The food looked ok but nothing special. 
I ensured the flight to JFK was a 777 with the new Business cabin. This ensured direct aisle access and the new pod seating. The seat was very comfortable with more than enough leg room and a quick push of a button resulted in a fully flat bed.

The food service was very efficient with several choices from each course and a good selection of pre and post meal drinks and wine for the meal itself. 
A snack was provided before landing. 

Upon my return red eye flight home the lounge at JFK was quiet and the showers clean and refreshing. I could have taken my evening meal in the lounge but after a large lunch I decided to wait for it on the plane. There was a choice of an express meal or full dinner. I opted for the latter. This was served straight after take off which then allowed a few hours sleep.  
I decided to skip breakfast as due to the shorter flight was served only 5 hours after I had finished dinner. 
Upon arrival at CDG I was fortunate to be alllowed access to the Air France Lounge as my connecting flight was with Flybe via codeshare. This is good for not having to wait around for so long but Flybe are a no frills airline but at least their flight was on time. 

I would highly recommend Air France as long as you have a refurbished plane as the old Business Class looks very dated.

Most uncomfortable long haul economy flight we have ever experienced,London,Johannesburg,International,"Heathrow to Johannesburg via Paris. During the long 12 hour bit from Paris to Johannesburg we were seated in the ""upstairs"" part of economy - just behind Business Class.  The seats were by far and away the least comfortable we had ever experienced on a long haul flight -  like flying 12 hours on RyanAir! The entertainment selection was a choice between either extremely dated movies or ones in French only. The rubbery piece of fish that we were served for dinner was almost inedible. In addition, our particular seats did not recline at all (as there was a bulkhead just behind us) and the legroom was so non-existent that my husband and I both experienced problems with swollen feet and legs for the first time ever on a flight. It was impossible to sleep because the temperature constantly fluctuated between stuffily hot and freezing cold. The staff were indifferent and lurked behind the curtain in the galley for as much of the flight as possible - so a trip to ask for a glass of water felt like an unwelcome intrusion.

A miserable experience. Next, the flight attendants were rude and very unfriendly and it seemed worse because we were Americans. They had no emotion and acted like they really didn‚Äôt want to be there. One of the attendants even rolled her eyes and basically just plopped our food down.

Then were told to wait for another 30 minutes. A total of 60 minutes. Then we were told to go to the Customer Service counter. No one was at the customer service center at 9 AM! There was no body to tell us what to do next. We searched and found another customer service center further down at the airport. There were just two representatives. It took them 30 minutes to process/rebook each one of us, passengers. No apology offered. No water was offered.

First Joon's flight (TXL ---> CDG)...,Berlin,Paris,Europe,"I would like to share my experience flying with Joon, a subsidiary (low cost) airline owned by Air France. I did arrive at Berlin Tegel Airport (TXL) approx. 7:35 am for 10:05 am's flight but I decided to spend time walking around at the airport before heading to check-in counter at 8:15 am.

When I approached Joon's ticket counter, I just realized there was quite a long queue. The queue was not really visible from distance as it was partly covered by another (long) queue in front of KLM's check-in counter which was located right next to it. I spent a good 45 minutes before I reached the check-in counter.

During the check-in process, I was happy because the staff asked me to check-in my hand carry luggage with no extra charge as the flight was almost or completely full that morning. Waiting area is basically behind the check-in counter but we had to pass the security check area before being able to enter the area.

Boarding was prompt and efficient. Our flight departed on time and again, it touched down at Charles de Gaulle's Paris Airport on time.

A nightmare to book and rude staff,Lyon,London,Europe,"We booked our flights almost 9 months ahead of time. At the time of booking we didn‚Äôt realise that we made it without luggage. So we added 2 bags to our booking. And there the pain started. For some reason the system changed these. Of one of the passengers and did not add it to the booking. So we had to call AF help desk or customer service 6 times to get it fixed... everytime we called they said they couldn‚Äôt find it and than they would fix it. Surprise surprise when we arrived at the airport the problem still wasn‚Äôt fixed... so it took 30min and several phone calls from the staff to get it fixed. Flight from LHR to CDG was on time but flight to Lyon was delayed by 1 1/2 hrs... on the return we had still the same problem and the check in staff was totally unprofessional and unhelpful.

Another Visit to South Africa,Paris,Johannesburg,International,I have flown on Air France many times in the past to South Africa because it has convenient connections from my nearest airport ( Birmingham ) with a short connection at Paris Charles dear Gaulle. The reason for choosing Air France is because they fly the Airbus A380 which has duo seats ( two seats together ) all be it at a slightly higher cost than standard economy but a lot less than premium economy. These seats are on the top deck so is well above the engines so slightly less noisy than standard economy on the bottom deck. I always try to get the seats directly behind the bulk head which is row 88 and gives slightly more leg room than those behind. The food on board the flight was good although they do not always have your choice from the menu. There is a good choice of beverages. Departure and arrival times are nearly always as stated on the itinerary which is another reason why I choose Air France and always will be my first choice when I choose to Fly from Birmingham for the connection. Price is not cheap but is competitive with other airlines.,2019-02,2019-02-23,4.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
Long flight in poor conditions,San Jose,London,International,"The 1st leg of this flight (unfortunately the longest part) was dreadful. The limited space was made worse by the passenger in front (who was quite heavy) reclining his seat suddenly. He split my drink over me and was unconcerned. I was extremely cramped and when I eventually reclined my seat so that I could see the screen, the passenger behind was obviously unhappy and kicked the back of my seat continually. 
The staff were pretty indifferent throughout the service and all the food provided was of poor quality. When we left the plane the cabin crew were chatting amongst themselves and did not acknowledge the departing passengers. Never seen this before with any other airline.

The last part of the journey from Paris was completely different - a really charming crew. Sandwiches were served and these were of good quality. Much better experience but sadly, we will avoid AF in the future.",2018-12,2019-02-23,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0
As Good As it Gets,Johannesburg,Chicago,International,"It is a really long flight from JNB to ORD.  Total flying hours 20 in 2 flights.  The crew and flight attendants have a huge job to keep a plane full of passengers comfortable for that long.  The Air France people did a great job.  They were friendly, compassionate and very accommodating when asked for help.  The flight attendants were very cordial when they needed to attend to passenger safety like requiring seat belts to be fastened etc.  The restrooms were kept well stocked and clean.  We saw flight attendants attending to this quite often.  The food was good and there were plenty of beverages, snacks and water in the galley anytime you wanted.  There is no real way to be comfortable in such a long flight but  the staff did their best and we appreciate it.  Air France is one of the best airlines we have flown.  Sure, there are more luxury options and more luxurious airlines but bottom line for us is we needed to return to the US on a budget basis and they made it happen with class.

Such a pity and reminded me immediately of KLM and Lufthansa I flew not long ago that had friendly and enthusiastic cabin staff.       Seat pitch and width was fairly generous for this 11 plus hour long haul fight.    AVOD is above average but latest movie choice was a bit limited.    Meal was pretty decent as well.   Just like my inbound leg  they hardly had any water or juice run for this long haul sector.   Other than that, we arrived in Paris on time and the flight was very smooth with no that much turbulence.",2018-11,2019-02-22,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0
Not my preferred carrier,Amman,Paris,International,"Air France is not my preferred carrier. I have flown with them a couple of times (only when I have to), but am always ""surprised"" about how the cabin crew don't want to speak English. Despite talking to them in English, they always seem to respond in French. My latest flight with AF was no different.

The cabin crew also were a bit grumpy. A smile costs nothing but can go a long way with passengers. I travel other airlines as well and the majority of crews will have a smile on their face.

In this case, I had a night flight so people try to get some sleep. About an hour before landing, breakfast was served. Instead of clicking on the dimmed lighting (allowing people to wake up smoothly), the cabin crew clicked on the full lights without warning (abruptly waking up everybody). Effective, but not customer oriented...

Overall, the airline itself is ok, but they could be more friendly towards their customers and realize they have a lot of international, non-French speaking passengers as well.",2019-02,2019-02-21,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

Great service,Los Angeles,Paris,International,"***This is a double review. *** So read through for info on both Business and Premium Economy.

Business on Air France is very nice, you are greeted with a drink and snack and offered a menu to review prior to the departure.  Yes vacation has truly begun. Upon reaching cruising altitude more drinks and your order is taken, your food comes out and you enjoy a fine meal with appropriate wines for your meal. After which you are treated to dessert and a port or after dinner drink. Upon waking from your restful sleep in your fold flat bed, or almost flat bed is breakfast and warm towels as you prepare to land in Paris.  Oh what a shame this could not go on for a few more hours.

Premium Economy service is not quite as plush, the seats are comfortable and do recline, but not as well.  The food and drink are as good, but the level of service and comfort are not.  You do get what you pay for and on a long flight such as this it's worth the extra to be comfortable. As a caveat, I am on the taller side and bigger side (6'4"" 290 lbs) so for me to fly in Economy was not an option and Premium Economy was to make the best of a situation.",2018-09,2019-02-21,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Satisfied with AIr France,Paris,Hong Kong,International,"I have been using Air France since 25 year in Economy and Business for flights to Asia and Americas and I can‚Äôt complain at all. To start, Air France flies everywhere and Charles de Gaulle is outstandingly served with lots of daily flights from all European cities. I have always flown in well maintained and clean aircrafts , Air crew it‚Äôs always kind and helpful , good in flight entertainment, decent food , decent seat pitch. Their premium economy class it‚Äôs indeed very good with ‚Äúold type business seats‚Äù. Most frequent fliers complain frequent strikes and luggage lost; in 25 years I never lost a baggage with AF and in one occasion , coincidentally with a strike at CDG , I have been, rebooked onto another airline and reached my destination on time as scheduled.

Lost lugagae,Paris,Tel Aviv,International,"We were on a connecting flight from Copenhagen. In Paris we had only 45 minutes to shift to our plane to Tel Aviv. It was to short time. We had to run to a gate far away. It was very stressful. Arriving at Ben Gurion our suitcase wasn‚Äôt there. 

We had to spend two half days waiting for our suitcase to arrive. A lot of time, hence we only had two full days in Jerusalem. We didn‚Äôt travel so far to wait for our suitcase.

Travel by JOON operated Air France flight,Mumbai,Paris,International,"I was to travel to Paris from Mumbai, India on 11th Feb 2019. I looked for Air France tickets & booked. However I got email from JOON. On closer inspection, the ticket was from AirFrance only, but operated by an agency called JOON. 

I had never heard about JOON, so I boarded the plane with fingers crossed. However to my pleasant surprise, the service was very good, the flight was smooth & in flight entertainment was excellent. the flight crew was English speaking, so no problem in communication. 

However I had one strange experience. When the air hostess appeared for serving pre-dinner beverages, I asked for red wine (which I had always relished in all  my earlier flights.) She simply refused. She said the wine can be obtained only if I approach the crew station. I told her....France is famous for wines & how come you refuse me to serve at my seat. To this she smilingly said, yes wine is available but can be given only at crew station & not at the seat. I was utterly confused & left the point, since it was very late in night & finished dinner & slept off. 

In my return flight no. AF 0218 Paris to Mumbai, I asked the purser right before plane took off, what that air hostess could have meant & explained to him whole incident. He also said it was very strange & red wine was always available & could not be refused. She need not have asked me to go to crew station. So he served me two small bottles & asked to enjoy. Later he came up for a chat & asked if I liked the wine & I enjoyed it. 

Anyway. Except for the above incident, the flight experience was superb & cuisine was very tasty. In flight tv screen was very good for use & contents was excellent. 

I am sure I will use Air France JOON again & again....even for my journey ahead of France to US. Regards.",2019-02,2019-02-18,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0

What compensation!!,Birmingham,St Martin / St Maarten,International,"We flew from Birmingham UK to Charles de Gaulle on Sunday, with an overnight stop. Next day we flew to St Maarten. Upon our arrival after a long wait we were told one of our suitcases was still in Paris.  We were given a document telling us we could spend 100 euros on essentials. We went by ferry to Anguilla and told they would get the case to us as soon as possible.
When we contacted Air France the next day we were told it would be on the flight on Wednesday. On the Wednesday we were told the plane out that day was delayed. The case could not be collected until Thursday at the  port in Anguilla after 3pm and that we would have to go to the port to collect it as it would have to go through customs. 
My husband has a skin condition which necessitates he wears a hat. This along with the sunscreen and toiletries were in the delayed case. So for four days I had very few clothes.  So we bought toothbrushes toothpaste, two pairs of panties, a sun hat and sunscreen.
Anyone going to Anguilla would know there are very few shops. We had a receipt for the hat, sunscreen, toothpaste and toothbrushes and taxi to the port and back.
So cutting our last day on Anguilla short we went to collect the case. We also spent time emailing and phoning the airport and Air France. As we were due to go on a cruise we were concerned I would have few clothes. 
We contacted Air France as we would not be back home to make a claim within the 21 days required. We had confirmation that it would be OK to make a claim when we returned.
On our return I went on the internet to complete the form online. Copied my receipts.
 A reply said they could not be read. One receipt had slightly faded so I resent with my credit card statement (26 US$). 10 $ for toothpaste, 27$ for sunscreen and 28$ for the taxi. I resent all the copies.
We have recieved ¬£28. We were told the taxi was to paid by us even though this loss occurred through their incompetence.They did not accept credit card statements as it does no specify what was bought. I think for four days inconvienience our claim was small plus all the time spent tracking down the return of the case and contacting Air France. I sent an email giving them them the web page of the shop where the hat was purchased to show it was around the corner from the hotel. We walked 2 miles to buy suncreen. 
I would never travel with them again as I feel they did not believe we bought these items. The plane was old the screen on my seat was cracked and the sound hardly audible. I had the pasta as I do not eat chicken and when the snack came it was chicken sandwich with no alternative. On our return flight my seat did not fully recline but the person infront had there seat fully reclined so it was very cramped and I got no sleep.
What a pathetic  Airline. Sorry they are good at one thing saying ""they are sorry for the inconvenience"". I think they have no idea of the stress they create.",2019-01,2019-02-18,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0

On par with U.S. legacy carriers,London,Rabat,International,"My first experience with AF was mediocre.

Ground operation was terrible - I was in economy (no reason to buy business class on Euro flights as the seat is the same as coach) and I am Sky Priority but service standard was 'whatever' feeling. No greets, no smiles, just glum robots - just like I expect in the U.S. I did not appreciate the FA's cramming items into the overhead to the point smashing other items. A positive was flights were timely - negative (this is out of AF's control but still reflects the experience as France is in their name - I make the same hacks on 'American' at my crappy home airport) was the horrible airport of CDG Paris, which was a transit nightmare of poor signage, construction, glum, dirty, and unhelpful airport staff.

Distinctly average,Paris,Canton of Geneva,Europe,"Flights are relatively cheap and the service on-board is in keeping with a flag carrier but the back-end service is shocking.

The luggage policy is designed to catch people out, checked luggage is charged in 23kg units and pooling of allowances is not permitted, irritating if you are flying into Europe on airline with a sensible luggage policy.

The telephone number provided on the booking confirmation does not connect from outside of France and they take a week to respond to an email.

The day before bag-drop at CDG was supposed to open at 15:30 but staff were still shuffling in at 16:00.

Compensation incredibly difficult to claim,Marseille,Venice,Europe,"My flight, which I booked through HOP! was cancelled, so my journey took 9 hours instead of 1.5. This meant I was entitled to compensation of 250 euros.

After a month or two of emails, I had finally provided Air France everything they needed - they then came back and said I need a French bank account for them to make an international transfer?? Not only was it myself, but also my friend who I was flying with, who requested compensation. After 3 months they had finally paid me, but not my friend. To further add to the annoyance, the first payment to myself was less than the 250 euros stated (I assume due to tax), however, when my friend finally received their refund, it was even less than what I had received.

Easy night flight,London,Johannesburg,International,"We always fly Air France when we go to JoBurg because It works out the cheapest. The flight from London to Paris for the stop over takes maybe 45 minutes and the stop over is nice and quick! We land and jump into the queue to get on the connecting airbus. Then we have 10 hours to watch tv, eat and sleep (mostly sleep) in the airbus, which is roomy so we are comfortable. We would fly direct but we traveled 2 days before Christmas and arrived on Christmas Eve so all the direct flights were double or more what we paid for the indirect flights. The abundance of french bread they provide always fills me up as I cannot eat actual meals on flights. The flight attendants have always been super professional and helpful.

Slightly annoyed,Malaga,Dubai,International,"On the whole this was a good return trip. There is no direct flight from M√°laga so we had to fly with Air Europa to Paris CDG. Generally, we have no problem with any of the flights, which left bang on time and arrived on time or earlier. Service on board all flights was excellent. Our return flight from Dubai on 6th Feb with the Air France leg, back to Paris, was especially good with attentive cabin staff and as we were flying in a smaller craft, my husband and I were able to choose to sit in just two seats on the side ( window and aisle). 
The slight annoyance was on the Air Europa flight to Paris two weeks earlier,   we were randomly put several rows apart and to sit together had to pay ‚Ç¨10 each to sit together. Seeing as we had already paid nearly ‚Ç¨1000 to AirFrance, I objected to having to pay more to a company we had had no choice to fly with. On the way back we were put together for free, so why not on way there?
 The really annoying thing was, as we were checking in in M√°laga, a Dutch family came along with their two children and said, ‚Äúwe would like to sit together with a window if possible‚Äù
‚ÄúYes, Sir, no problem!!‚Äù  
So if we had waited to check in at airport, we might have had our seats together for free too.

"Tired, older aircraft",Paris,Ho Chi Minh City,International,"I was surprised to learn that Air France still have about 30% of their fleet waiting to be upgraded to the much improved newer business class seats, this flight had the older side by side layout that does not even go fully flat, however I still really enjoyed my flight because of the 80-year old lady in the next seat.  To say that she likes to travel would be an understatement!  She kept me entertained for much of the duration of the flight, retailing me with stories of her exploits and travels.  Of course, being an Air France flight the food was really good, as was the quality of the champagne and wine selection.  But, what really made the flight for me were the members of staff, they were superb. Air France should be very proud of them.",2019-01,2019-02-07,5.0,5.0,3.0,3.1219191587249426,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
Discriminated Against by Ticket Agents,Portland,Paris,International,"On our recent travel from Portland, Oregon to Paris, France (with our ultimate destination being Corsica) on December 21, 2018, we were scheduled on Icelandair Flight 7634 (operated by Alaska Airlines as Flight 905) from Portland to Seattle, which was canceled due to mechanical problems.  We were rebooked on Air France flight 0077 from Los Angeles to Paris.  Once at LAX, we approached an Alaska Airlines agent named Zach, explained our situation, and presented the flight confirmation paperwork given us.  He looked in the computer at our ticket history, then excused himself to go and confer with Alaska officials.  He soon returned with our paperwork and wrote the reservation reference number for our Air France flight (BWOAOV) along with his name and phone number (Zach:  310-665-1460), as well as the original confirmation code from Alaska of V7A73U.  ‚ÄúPlease have them call me if there is any issue,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúThere should not be a problem.‚Äù

When we approached the Air France ticketing desk, we were met by an agent who scrutinized us closely as we handed her our paperwork and passports.  Looking at the computer screen, she immediately shook her head.  ‚ÄúThe flight is completely full,‚Äù she said.  ‚ÄúIt has been for three months.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThen how could we get a confirmation number?‚Äù we asked.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, they must have forced the reservation,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúForced?‚Äù   She shrugged her shoulders and regarded us with a cold, unsympathetic, and slightly contemptuous air.  At this point, my wife broke down in tears, having not slept the night before and stressed out of her mind over the whole situation.  We urged the Air France agent to call the Alaska agent at LAX, pointing to his phone number on the paperwork.  ‚ÄúNo, we are not going to call anyone.  It is not our policy to call,‚Äù she said.  ‚ÄúYour only options are to fly standby or look for another flight.‚Äù  Two other Air France agents stood by, offering no support.  With my wife in tears, the first Air France agent ordered us to move away so others could approach the desk.  The agent then walked away and disappeared behind a wall.

We moved to an adjacent desk where another Air France agent briefly looked at our reservation and then said she could not help us.  Finally, a third agent came to the computer to work on getting our luggage removed from the Air France flight that they would not let us on.  At this time, another passenger then approached the Air France desk‚Äîan African American woman, who told the Air France agent that her flight had been canceled and that she had purchased a Business Class ticket on Air France flight 0077 to Paris.  The agent told her that she couldn‚Äôt possibly have a ticket because the flight was full, ‚Äúcompletely full,‚Äù she added.  ‚ÄúHere,‚Äù said the woman, holding forth her cell phone.  ‚ÄúI have the reservation confirmation right here from Air France.‚Äù  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not possible,‚Äù said the agent.  ‚ÄúThe flight is completely full.‚Äù  ‚ÄúLook,‚Äù said the woman.  ‚ÄúThere were 3 Business Class tickets available on this flight, and I purchased one. I have a confirmation from Air France right here on my phone. I need to get on this flight,‚Äù she said, handing the agent her passport. 

At this point, my wife said to the woman, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs interesting.  We were told the same thing from the Alaska Airlines agent in Portland.  There were 3 Business Class seats available, and she reserved 2 for us.  You must have booked the 3rd one.  Something is going on here.  This is not right.‚Äù  We looked at one another in the way that people do who believe they are being lied to.  The Air France agent suddenly appeared nervous and said, ‚ÄúWait just a moment.‚Äù  She then disappeared behind a wall.  
After a short time, the Air France agent returned and provided a boarding pass for a Business Class seat to the woman passenger, offering no explanation as to why a seat had suddenly become available.  No passes, however, were extended to us.  Instead, an Air France supervisor approached us and reiterated what the first agent had told us:  we would need to fly standby if we intended to try and get on our flight.  We pleaded with her to please call the Alaska agent, Zach, who had confirmed us for the Air France flight.  She told us that it was not their policy.  She also said how our original tickets were Economy Class, not Business Class, which could not be honored.  When we said that Alaska told us they would pay the difference in fare price, she said that this does not always happen, and that they have the right to decline a partner airline‚Äôs reservation for rebooked flights.  Given that our standby chances were better in economy class than Business Class, we then asked if we could be put on standby for economy class, too.  ‚ÄúYou would be willing to fly economy?‚Äù she asked.  ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù we explained, reiterating that we had connecting flights to catch to ultimately reach Corsica and catching those flights was the priority.  She then told us to wait while she took our reservation paperwork and disappeared.  Fifteen minutes later, she reappeared with 2 Economy Class boarding tickets for the Air France flight.  Again, no explanation for how 2 seats just magically appeared on a flight that had supposedly been full for 3 months. One seat was near the front of the plane and the other way in the back.  When we asked if it was possible to be seated closer together, the Air France supervisor said that we could not change seats.

Once at the gate, we decided to check one last time whether we could be seated closer together.  There were 2 Air France agents, one of whom had previously been at the ticketing counter.  My wife approached the other agent and asked if he could check to see if other seats closer together were available.  The agent who had been at the ticketing counter then said very rudely, ‚ÄúYou were told that you could not change seats!‚Äù  She then busied herself with helping another passenger.  Thankfully, the other agent did look at seat availability and found two seats in adjacent rows.  He then reassigned us to these seats.  Again, for a supposedly full flight, there appeared to be numerous seats available.  
    
In all respects, this was the most degrading and frustrating flight experience we have ever had.  With our carry on bags being small backpacks and neither of us wearing business attire, it was clear to us that Air France agents profiled us and engaged in blatant discrimination.  And it is equally obvious that Air France agents discriminated against an African American woman and were not going to let her board Business Class until the three of us caught the agents in their lie.  Even more than the discrimination, however, was the pain of witnessing other human beings (and airline professionals, at that) being so mean, hurtful, and disrespectful to other human beings.  How much does it take to pick up the phone to resolve a situation for stressed-out passengers just trying to get somewhere?",2018-12,2019-02-07,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

Good service,Sao Paulo,Nice,International,"I had recently traveled on an Air France plane and it was a good experience. The leg room was not much but was acceptable for the economy class. The seats can be a problem as they do not recline much - if you're flying economy you should be not expecting to get the best seat available on the plane, right?
If you are bored, there are plenty of videos, musics and even breathing exercises in the entretaining system - they offer earplugs.
The staff was kind and helpful, they served two meals during the flight, both of which were good - I wasn't expecting to have French bistro level...
I would recommend flying Air France. 
As of for check-in, I'll make comments on a situation. My flight was canceled and I was not informed by the company. Actually, I was awared of it because I myself searched the flight status on the website. Thankfully, I was in advance as it took almost five days for them to solve my problem and realocate me in another flight.",2019-01,2019-02-06,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0819906910132473
Never again,Mumbai,Paris,International,"We were on a long haul from Mumbai to Charles de Gaul airport, 10 hours. 
I don‚Äôt sleep much on night flights but after the pathetic hard wrap that I couldn‚Äôt eat because it was burned. We apparently had to sleep. 
So the lights all went out and I watched a mediocre film, no new releases that was advertised in the sky magazine. 
I tried to turn on the over head light to read my book and they weren‚Äôt working so I tried the crew call button, that didn‚Äôt show up above the seat so assumed wasn‚Äôt working. 
I went right to the back of the plane to look for someone and there was no one, I assume they had all retired for the night. 
So I sat in the dark for more than 6 hours. 
An hour before landing I had asked to speak to someone. The manager came and was constantly shouting me down as I was trying to tell her. ‚ÄúWe turn off all lights as it‚Äôs a night flight and everyone goes to sleep‚Äù well I don‚Äôt and I dare say there are a few like me.

Refusal to admit liability for incompetence in Baggage transfer,Vancouver,Chennai (Madras),International,"The flight from YVR Canada to CDG Paris was delayed by about 30 min on 10-Dec-2018. This coupled with delayed wheel chair travel resulted in missed connection flight from CDG to MAA, India. 
Air France Customer Service at Terminal 2E rebooked our next flight scheduled to depart 11 hours later and assured the baggage will be automatically transferred. 

But Air France not only failed to transfer the baggage, but also failed to send it even on next day. After my complaint, they sent it on 3 day and I received it on 4 th day.
The response from Customer service towards my claim for for purchase of essential clothing (supported by receipts) is really disappointing. Even though Air France's negligence was well documented, they refused to admit responsibility and tried to make me contact the last airline that delivered i.e. Air India ( though it is not at all their fault). Still Air India offered a limited compensation. 
When I tried to claim the balance from Air France - again they refused and instead asked me to contact my travel insurance. All these took FORTY FIVE days and still not resolved.

Business Class just didn't compare to others......,Birmingham,Bangkok,International,"Let me just say, that this review is a comparative review to other Airlines with the same seating's class, origin, destination and time of year. It isn't by any means a ""blast review"" and I'll explain my comparisons. We have been lucky enough to fly with; Qatar, Eva Air, Emirates and Turkish Airlines in Business Class. Obviously there are price differences, with Turkish being the lowest, but this time we decided on Air France. I have to say that not any single item was as good, never mind better, than the competition. 
Firstly, as for booking in, timescales, gate courtesy and boarding - this was all spot on and as good as any other airline.
The rating charts that I've filled in is as follows.
Legroom: This is the same as other business class, but we didn't get the extra storage under your feet that some offer.
Seat Comfort: As a standard seat it was just OK. Where it really failed was in both adjustment and when trying to sleep. Adjustment was both basic and slow. When in Lay Flat position - it didn't. It had a slight slope on it that meant you slid down continuously.
InFlight: Fiddly display and small screens. Frustrating menu system.
CustomerService: Struggled with the language barrier. Always seemed uninterested in our requests. Rarely available.
Value: Cost more than some other airlines - for less of a service.
Check In: Good. Simple and easy as you'd expect with business class.

I am going to write a formal complaint at there lack to customer service. I'm due to travel tomorrow for business and have no bag which includes important work documents.

Boarding slow as they check every bag to ensure it is cabin size. Slow check in due to all the people taking skiing holidays with cheaper Flybe flights

Worst. Airline. Arbitrary rules and snotty staff.,Johannesburg,Los Angeles,International,"We had absolutely the WORST experience we have ever had while traveling when checking in for our flight with Air France. We booked through Delta and did not choose to fly on Air France. I checked all of the baggage requirements for Air France before going to the airport. We each had one small backpack (standard school size) and one small hand luggage. We were singled out by the Air France agents and treated differently than all other passengers. I know this because I literally watched everyone else go through the process. We were told we could not bring our backpack and hand luggage. Our backpacks met the under seat requirements for an accessory. We flew 35 hours (including on one other Air France flight) from LAX to Cape Town with the exact same bags with no issue. With our backpacks under the seats in front of us and our hand bags in the overhead bins. We asked for a manager who came out and treated us like we were the stupidest, most imbecile Americans she (and her other female colleague) had ever dealt with. She talked over us and repeatedly told us she was the one that would ultimately make the decision whether we would even be allowed on the flight so we better be nice to her. I have never felt so frustrated and demeaned by anyone in my life. The issue ultimately had nothing to do with the weight of our bags. She insisted repeatedly for 15 minutes that we needed to  admit that we had too many bags.  We did not. We had one hand bag each, which fit the weight and dimension requirements for a hand bag carry on, and one accessory bag each, which fit the weight and dimension requirements for an accessory and fit under the seat. We also had only one small bag to check through, and which we explained we would check through. It was a clear display of power she wanted to make known. It was an unfair implementation and application of false rules. We were the only people singled out for this treatment. We ultimately had to repack our bags and check multiple. She would not even let us go check in after that but rather walked us to the counter and stood over us making us feel like criminals all the way through to security. She was horrible. I have never felt so put down in my life. When we got to the gate we very quickly saw the majority of other passengers had large accessories, most bigger than our backpacks, as well as large rolling luggage, all being allowed on the plane. The boarding process was also a complete disaster. It was the most disorganized, chaotic experience I have ever seen. I am a worldwide well seasoned traveler and can truly say I have not seen such a disaster in as long as I can remember. The plane was ready for hours beforehand, but we still left an hour late due completely to the slow and disastrous boarding process. Honestly, this is the third time I have experienced rude, demeaning, dismissive staff members with Air France. This time sealed the deal for me and I will NEVER fly Air France again. We both feel we were 100% singled out and treated poorly because we are American. We were discriminated against and I am appalled any airline would treat its customers this way.",2019-01,2019-01-27,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0

Hard and soft product lacking,New Delhi,Paris,International,"First time on Air France on a trip from DEL to ultimately LAX.  I was aware of the angled lie flat (as opposed to full lie flat) business class configuration and while the comfort exceeded my expectations relative to my experience with the AeroMexico angled lie flat business class product it does not compare well to other global carriers.  Sister company KLM offers full lie flat seats albeit in a 2-2-2 configuration and almost all North American and Asian carriers offer full lie flat seats with direct aisle access for every seat.  Seat comfort was fine but not spectacular and there was a wide array of entertainment options on pretty decent sized screens.

The soft product left a lot to be desired with perfunctory and disorganized service.  Menus were not handed out and there was no mention of an evening meal service that was apparently available. Since this was a 1:05 AM departure not that big of an issue and most of the cabin fell asleep before any service was started.  The crew did miss the opportunity to verify interest in breakfast service during the pre-departure beverage service which is helpful for early morning arrivals as some passengers do not want to be disturbed and get some extra sleep when arriving at 6:00 AM. Passengers were woken up for breakfast service but only 45 minutes out from touch down leading to a very rushed service. Food quality was very average and the meal did not look particularly appetizing.

Expected more from the service aspect especially based on my experience with other European carriers on long haul routes.  While it is unfair to rate an airline on a single specific flight because each flight crew is different, the core values of an airline to its customers and how their crews are trained do play a role in the passenger experience.  My opinion of the soft product was unchanged on my continuation flight from CDG to LAX where I again experienced disinterested service and passengers were made to feel more like a nuisance than a valued customer.

It is not likely that I will choose Air France for flights within the Skyteam alliance and focus on Delta and KLM for service through Europe.",2019-01,2019-01-27,2.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0

"36 hours of stress, without access to medication",Paris,Los Angeles,International,"We spent 12 hours in one departure wing of the airport. That wing, K, had no restaurants except Starbucks (they called Starbucks a restaurant). Hot food options were microwaved sandwiches and pizza slices. After a delay of almost 3 hours we boarded. One hour later they told us the fight was cancelled. We then spent 90 minutes on line before they invited us to a shorter line to make arrangements for our layover. The arrangements included a packaged meal and a bag with a child's toothbrush, packets of toothpaste,a deodorant wipe, a comb and a tee shirt. We were told that we will spend the night in a hotel 20 minutes away. The bus to the ""hotel"" has no amenities and it was crowded like a school bus. We had to wait until every seat was full. The ""20 minute ride"" took an hour and 15 minutes. The ""hotel"" turned out to be a youth hostel. The room had beds, towels, a soap fixture in the shower and nothing else. The only good thing about the room was clean sheets and no bed bugs.Our bus to the airport was supposed to leave at 7:00 AM so we missed breakfast and a cup of coffee. Our new flight was nearly full so my wife and I were assigned seats in different rows. Our only chance of sitting together was by asking a man to change seats. He was indignant about losing a seat he claimed cost him over $100.00 so naturally he refused. Our ""agent"" told us he would switch without any problem. Finally, I suffer from hypertension. My medication was packed in my luggage. The Air France agent told me I should have packed my meds in carry-on because I could not access my luggage. I was a total wreck for the flight home. The only medication I had access to was alcohol. Air France did furnish me with scotch generously. The Parisians on our cancelled flight had the option of a refund so many of them took it and went home. As foreigners we were stuck, The reason's Air France gave us for the flight cancellation were ""their computers were hacked"" and ""LAX refused to let the flight arrive late"".

The flight attendant didn‚Äôt seem surprised. The meal was fine, she did offer us booze and lots of it. 

I will say the seats were HARD. The thin pillow they offer didn‚Äôt help much. 

The in-flight entertainment options were good. They offered lots of foreign language options so you can brush up as you get to where you‚Äôre going.

Smooth return from USA to UK on Air France,San Francisco,Manchester,International,"After spending three weeks with my parents in the San Francisco Bay Area, I flew Air France flight 83 from SFO to CDG, connecting into Manchester UK.

The San Francisco to Paris leg boarded on time, left on time and arrived in Paris a bit early!  Flight was smooth and comfortable, and the inflight crew was very attentive and helpful.

Premium economy isn't really worth the extra,London,Beijing,International,"In terms of the timing for the flights and jet lag, this isn't bad. You fly from Heathrow leaving at 8pm, get to Charles de Gaulle at 10pm and fly to Beijing at midnight. Good for jet lag - but bad for traffic in Beijing - you arrive at about 4:30pm and by the time you get through customs, etc. it's 5:30pm and its rush hour! In my case I arrived on a Friday - doubly bad.
The flight itself is pleasant enough, it's about 10 hours in the air and most of the time you could be asleep. In premium economy you'd expect a comfortable reclinable seat, - you don't get one. On the two flights I took, both premium economy the seat wasn't well padded and wasn't comfortable or adjustable enough to get to sleep. I'm average height - 5'10"" - so it's not that I'm excessively tall. It's slightly bizarre, on the way back I walked through economy and their seats looked more comfortable - just not as wide. If anything the premium economy seats looked like they had come from an older plane than the economy ones?
The food is nice - being Air France you'd sort of hope that it would be - but is it worth the extra money you pay? In my view it's not. So, take care. In my view there are better carriers to China, but make sure you book in plenty of time around holidays - European and Chinese - as flights can get expensive and difficult to find really quickly. I booked about 8 weeks out - usually more than enough time and there was very little left!",2018-12,2019-01-24,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0
Business Class Paris-Singapore-Paris : food (and wine) disappointing,Paris,Singapore,International,"The cabin crew was very nice and helpful.
The lounge in Paris is ok. 
The lounge in Singapore is sub-standard. 
The in flight food was really disappointing on both flights... I remember good quality food in Business Class on Air France but they have cut so many corners that it is a real shame... especially for a National Airline representing a country and culture which prides itself in its wine and dine. The wine was also mediocre. At the connecting flight check-in in Paris, the person at the desk, holding our boarding pass delivered in Singapore, asked us three times if we flew with Air France from Singapore - WITH THE AF BOARDING PASS IN HER HANDS. The person wanted us to pay for extra baggage"" even though we were in Business and Gold (32k and we had only 3 bags of a total of 6 allowed and each bag was between 14 and 26k)... after a 12 hour night flight and a change of airports because the flights were full from CDG, that is NOT what we wanted to hear or the way we wanted to be treated. No apology, just a ""hmph"" when I asked her to repeat her question that seemed so ill placed WHILE SHE HELD OUR BOARDING PASS FROM SINGAPORE IN HER HANDS.
The price tag was more expensive than other options available for the same route. Perhaps one of the other airlines next time - some of them have better service and food and are less expensive.",2018-12,2019-01-24,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

We only learned this at check-in another city, and they were unable to make a seat change, claiming Delta personnel cannot see Air France seating on their screens. 
      We paid for and wanted aisle seats. If there is an equipment change on Air France, the policy is to give one passenger an aisle seat and to seat the second party next to that person, not on an aisle. Beware of equipment changes.

Terrible Carry-On Policy for Basic/Light Economy,Paris,Munich,Europe,"Flew on 1/6/19 (Sunday): Flew a short morning flight from Paris to Munich and as people enter the security line Air France employees are screening all passengers for their carry-on luggage to make sure they do not exceed the baggage weight limit. Air France only allows a total weight of 12 kg while other airlines allow 20+ kg for the total carry-on baggage. Why Air France decided to limit their weight more beyond other airlines is unknown, but they force you to check in a bag which makes me think they are trying to squeeze their budget friendly passengers. The flight we were on was not even full and had a ton of overhead baggage space. Air France should change their carry-on weight to match all other airlines instead of trying to low-ball their customers.

"Improvements required, surprised by previous quality of reviews.",Tokyo,Paris,International,"My flight from Tokyo to Charles De Gaulle was very underwhelming seeing at Air France have a number of good reviews. I believe they are in the top 10 best business class, however I would disagree. I must state as in a previous post my first experience was with Qatar on four flights totalling 24 hours in the air! 

The airport lounge in Tokyo is nice sharing with other airlines no problem there. The welcome onto the flight was very friendly and the staff welcoming from start to finish. The cabin itself was very clean lots of seats in the business section I think around 48, too many? Based on other flights I think that the seat wasted lots of space other airlines like KLM give the passenger more space I felt it was quite cramped. The compartment was on my left and my immediate support was that it was too big. Sleeping was not an issue I had a good 8 hours sleep bed was comfy and pillow very good. 

The breakfast was very good taste, quality and amount were all where you expect. The Dinner has three courses the starter and desert were too a high standard the main was below average. Large lump of beef, hard to cut, two carrots and two sugar snap peas with small potato gratin. Most of it was tasteless a sauce was supplier which was okay made it nicer. 

Entertainment was pretty average I could only pick 4 movies that I would consider watching and ended up not watching any the whole way through. Lucky I had plenty of time sleeping instead!

Unethical Business Practise,Victoria,Paris,International,"We booked for our family vacation on France months in advance. We chose Air France not for the price but for schedule and how it would fit into our holiday schedule. We saved for more than a year for this holiday and was pretty excited when it was about time to fly. Imagine our horror when I received an email 24 hours before our flight saying 'Your flight was cancelled'. It took my husband to go sit in the  Air France offices the whole day to save our holiday. First of all the lady did not even know the flight was cancelled and then she tried to book us on very inferior airlines. Eventually after a battle and some unpleasant words from my husband we were booked on Emirates. The flight was the day before we were originally meant to fly. All this happened after we received an email saying we should choose our seats and print our boarding passes. We were assured that everything was in order with the return flight. Well, the morning of our return flight, I received the same email 'Your flight was cancelled'. At least this time we did receive emails of our re-booking on other airlines, BUT my daughter was booked on a completely different flight from us.

Beware of Air Italia.,Atlanta,Naples,International,"Our flight was an international flight to Naples, Italy on Air France. The leg room was average. The food was average.

I have been in the Law Enforcement/Corrections business for 40 years and the search that was performed on me was terrible! 
On our flight back home from Milan, Italy was on Air Italia. Worst airline I have ever flown on! The leg room and seat room was almost non existent. To add insult to injury, the guy in the seat in front of me let his seat back and it was practically in my lap! When I asked him to move it up, he declined. I asked the flight attendent if he could have the man move his seat up and he said he had no authority to do it. The flight attendant did ask me if I wanted to change seats and I did. The food on this airline was terrible! The movies were several years old. I will never fly Air Italia again.

Snowstorm delayed flight lacked good service - Dulles to Paris - AF Flight 55,Washington DC,Paris,International,"Our flight was a 15 hour ordeal, instead of the 6 hour flight scheduled from Dulles to Paris Charles De Gaulle.  A snowstorm can affect any airline, but Air France's service on this flight left a lot to be desired.  I was in business class.

1. Snowstorm hit us Sunday night.  We spent 5 hours on the ground locked in the plane.  Now that wasn't Air France's fault, but the pilot was not as candid with us as he could have been.  I learned on Twitter that the airport was shut down for 2 of the 5 hours (the announcements just said there was a long line at de-icing).  After about 4 hours, we moved towards de-icing station.  Our 6:30pm departure actually left at about Midnight Washington time.

2. Due to the delay, our crew timed out while we were crossing the Atlantic.  So we awoke to the news that we were landing in Dublin.  We spent 90 minutes on the ground in Dublin (from about 1pm to 230pm), and eventually took off again landing in Paris at about 4 pm . . . 9 hours late . . . and then I had the needless bag pick up wait at baggage carousel.

3. One of my beefs is not with the above, with is largely the weather, but the Air France response.  The Cabin Crew did not circulate.  I had purchased two drinks which I finished during the flight.  We were parched.  No water was provided for a very long period of time.  It could have been loaded at Dublin.  

4. The new 18 kilo policy is obnoxiously doled out at Dulles.  I had a very difficult time with the gate agent over this.  He then asked if I wanted to upgrade to First Class -- where I guess I could pack 20 kilos that i had in my two carry-ons rather than 18 kilos.  I am going to have to buy new bags to fly on Air France and avoid checking a bag.  I had had 55 flights round trip and this has never been an issue.  So beware that business travelers need to get a scale to see if your carry ons exceed 18 kilos.  The obnoxious gate agent said it would be 1300 euros to upgrade to first class -- and condescendingly, do I need to know how much that is in dollars.  What I thought was:  ""I certainly know the conversion and that is too much in dollars, mac.""  

So, my advice to Air France travelers is to pack up extra food for the flight, even if you are in business class.  If you carry on your bags, you now need to weigh them at home -- total hassle.  And in light of all of this, it may be time to pick another airline.  Egads -- do I have to choose an American carrier?  I guess so.   They are improving their game, while Air France I am so sad to report, seems to be dropping its game.

As I report, the return flight had the charm and efficiency of the cabin crew that was missing on this flight.  But the new 18 kilo policy is rigid and painful to travelers.",2019-01,2019-01-16,2.0,5.0,5.0,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.0,3.4978647686832742,1.0,3.0819906910132473
Air France Business Class:  No Wifi on Flight Paris CDG to Washington DC makes for a long 8 hour flight; 18 kilo rule,Paris,Washington DC,International,"I have flown round trip Wash DC - Paris more than 50 times.  I have in the past been charmed by Air France's service and generally the hospitality of its crew.  But recent experiences are making me question my loyalty for this carrier over others.  Two points are critical for the Business Traveler:

1. Air France is now all over Business Class travelers on their here-to-fore obscure 18 kilo rule.  It means that if you have a business case with papers and a laptop, plus a suitcase, you will just be over the weight limit.  My two bags were 20 kilos, so I had to check one.  That is a business person's worst nightmare -- another 20 minutes of productivity lost.  This happened at both Dulles Airport and at Charles De Gaulle so it seems to be a new policy.  It's bizarre because the weight the plane is carrying is the same and the overhead bins were only half full.  But the inconvenience is high.

2. No Wifi.  I had wifi flying to Paris.  No Wifi on Flight 54 Paris Charles De Gaulle to Washington Dulles.  So on the 1:45pm departure (7:45am departure US East Coast Time), you miss the entire business day with no possibility of email response.  Since this is an 8 hour flight, it is a killer.

3. On this flight, we departed 50 minutes late.  We were in our seats on time.  No explanation was announced.  Ugh.  So we got in at 5:05pm.

4. Pack extra food.  I bought two sandwiches and two soft drinks to get me through this flight.  The cabin crew were great and were constantly circulating.  But I find with my metabolism the six hour gap between the first meal and the second is too much.  And the first meal was pretty mediocre for the entree (beef does not do well on flights).  And the light meal is often so gourmet that I have little interest in it.  So the frequent flyer is advised to bring a significant amount of your own food on board.

The cabin crew could not have been nicer.  They were a constant presence which was deeply appreciated.  The Air France coffee was good -- that's necessary for the six hour time zone adjustment.  Thank you.  

But the 18 kilo rule and wifi have me moving towards different airlines.  Delta -- this could affect you.

A not so convenient long haul flight,Paris,San Francisco,International,It is our first time to take a straight 11 hour flight across several time zones and i have to say that it is not a very pleasant experience. We've been flying with Air France/KLM with all our EU trips without any issues but this trip to the US is an exception. Food serving isn't very filling and intervals between snacks and main meal are too long. I get to notice that because my 5 year old son who has very little interest in food began complaining of hunger. He was trying to ask one of the attendants for another piece of a small snack mix and he just completely ignored him. Customer service in this particular flight wasn't that good either. We have to press the attendant button several times before someone comes.,2018-10,2019-01-13,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0

"The good, the bad and the ugly",Boston,Paris,International,"We flew to Paris in Premium Economy and back to Boston in Business.  We generally fly AF because my French husband prefers the national airline and I prefer non-stop flights and will always take the perks of  priority service when I can. Or so I thought.   Just a few things to note: The new PE seats are ok comfy but do not recline.  You get the leg room, but buyer beware if any degree of tilt is necessary for you to get even one wink of sleep. (The seats still recline in coach. Go figure). There was no first class cabin on our flight 334 so we seem to have reaped the benefits in Business. The overhead bins are enormous, the service attentive, and seats generous and fairly private tho IMHO still not as cushy as they once were. There‚Äôs a very good summary and pictures on the Points Guy web page however there were no Clarins products in our lav ü§®).  To note: AF CDG apparently doesn‚Äôt permit lounge access for all b/c tickets as we saw one couple denied because of the category of purchase (?).  After one satisfactory+ and one A+ flight,  I learned that my priority- checkled bag did not make the non-stop flight home and is at the moment ‚Äúunlocated‚Äù at CDG. The reason I write is to comment on the utter incompetence of the AF Boston staff who started by 1) giving me the WRONG CASE NUMBER so couldn‚Äôt immediately follow up, and 2) providing a baggage claim phone number that rang to a non-English speaking man in CAmbridge who later tried to convince me that he really was baggage assistance.   Call the number on the AF website 800-873-2247 and speak with people who know what they‚Äôre doing.   It may be days and days before your bag status is updated, especially if the tag was ripped off and they have no bar code for tracking. That said, I will still recommend AF over any of the US airlines that fly direct from Boston.

Flight cancelling monitoring,Canton of Geneva,Seoul,International,"I got my flight from Gva to Paris cancelled 24h before departure, so they cancelled my flight from Paris to Seoul too without asking me to agree. They offered me instead to leave one day after (meaning that my hotel and train reservations had also to be modified) via Moscow (??? what a nightmare!!!). I was furious and spent 30min on the phone with an amazingly calm and sweet lady to try to sort this out. At the end, when I reached the hysterical level, they agreed to let me depart the same day, but still via Moscow. This was a really stressful experience for me, as I was travelling on my own with children. At Moscow airport, it was totally disorganized and I nearly missed my connecting flight to Seoul, while I had 2 hours there. In the plane, of course I had the last available seats, so next to the kitchen, where it's impossible to sleep. It was a waste of money to pay for business class tickets. I was actually flying with Korean air, even though I booked via AF. It was maybe better for me, as I could not show my anger against AF staff. Overall, I would avoid next time AF, even though I am a FB member.
I really don't understand why they cancelled my flight from Paris to Seoul too (I could have taken the train or even the car, as I had plenty of time to reach Paris from Gva). When I asked the reason for doing that, they told me : it's the system?!? Yeah, it's always like that. Silly answer! It's the rule, it's the process, it's the regulation, ...

"Worst Airline- delays, lost bags, and terrible food",Madrid,Los Angeles,International,"I took a flight from Madrid to Los Angeles with AirFrance to visit my friends and family at home for Christmas after living abroad for 2 years. Firstly, the planes were always delayed, forcing me to run to the next connecting flight, making my travel experience extremely stressful. They forced me to check my carry-on bag last minute due to an overbooked flight, which had my medication and clothes in it for the whole 2 weeks of my trip. They promised me they would forward it directly to LAX, which I thought was going to make my life easier. Well, they lost my bag in the CDG (Paris) airport during my connection, and found it a day later. I was excited with the news they found my bag, however, they refused to send it to me until 13 days later. The lack of urgency is appalling! Everyday during my stay at home, I called the AirFrance customer service in which was a waste of time (approximately 45 minutes to an hour each day) where they assured me there was nothing they could do to get the bag back to me quickly. On New Years Eve, I finally had a breakthrough moment where they arranged to send me my bag. During these 2 weeks no one informed me of anything- no email, no calls, nothing. I had to call each and every day to inquire about my bag. So, they told me the bag would be on the next flight, so I called again to ensure it was on its way. SURPRISE! it was delayed, AGAIN! This company has no sense of urgency for its customers, and I have yet to receive the refund of the money for the necessary purchases I had to make during my trip. I have traveled to over 25 countries, taken over hundreds of flights, and this is by far the worst airline I have ever experienced!

The expereince was meh. Average,Los Angeles,Barcelona,International,"I've worked for two premium airlines and traveled in all cabins, so I have a discerning eye for customer service, quality product, etc. I often set my expectations really low when flying new carriers to try avoiding disappointment, and I remind myself it is the cost of exploring new places. :)

For economy, it's average long haul product. The A380 was a bit worn and needed a refresh of seats. The legroom is tight, but it is standard economy legroom. I lucked out and I had the seat next to me open.

The cabin crew from Los Angeles to Paris (connected on Joon in Paris to Barcelona) were a bit dismissive. There was technically a choice of meals, but the crew member that served me did not give me a choice. Other crew were offering choices. I also found the offering to be a bit disappointing for a company that comes from a country so focused on culinary arts.

There were inappropriate behaviors by other passengers and crew didn't say anything.  There was even a kid wearing a t shirt with very obvious curse words in English on it, but was allowed to wear it. I understand that passengers come with their own behaviors which many of us find annoying, inappropriate, or even appalling, but I feel like this really should have been addressed by the crew.

The airline has set minimum connection time in Paris from international long haul to a European destination too short. My connecting flight had 1 hour 15 minutes scheduled, and then the flight from Los Angeles was delayed. The airport is a bit of a nightmare to navigate and I ran through as much of it as I could. My flight was already boarding by the time I was at immigration and the doors were just about the close as I ran to the gate.

TERRIBLE!,Amsterdam,St Martin / St Maarten,International,"First of all: there is not enough time for the transfer in Paris Charles de Gaulle! Officially, you have a little over an hour but after landing it takes 25 minutes (!) taxiing to get you to the gate. And then you run, ask for priority treatment to skip the lines for passport control etc and then still you barely make it. On the return flight same samen and although I made it by running, my suitcase did not. It had to be sent home one day after arriving.

Then the food: disgusting. Salmon penne: only the penne, without any salmon: maybe one bite was fish. Dry cake. On the flight Paris - SXM I got one drinkt. Thats it. I had to walk to the back of the plane to get some water.

Entertainment:
So there was only one episode of CSI on it. Turned out it was a to be continued episode. Yeah, without the second episiode you still dont know who done it, waste of time.

Seats:
Mine was worn out so there was a bar underneath my seat that I felt the whole time and it cut off blood circulation underneath my knees.

"Great value, efficient on time flight",Manchester,Paris,Europe,"I flew outward to Paris CDG on AF for a quick trip after Christmas. 

I checked in online and travelled hand luggage only so no need to use check in desks. AF use T3 at Manchester. As usual there were extensive queues at departures to get through the aggressive security operation. Manchester airport is the pits in all terminals and they constantly shout at you while you are in the queue barking orders left right and centre. Not the fault of AF though.

Boarding was nearby via an air bridge and started in plenty of time. The flight was full and I had a window seat on a 3:3 set up aircraft, towards the front of economy. All seats seemed to fill up and I am glad I boarded early so I could get my roll on bag into the lockers.

Seat leg room is not great, however it's a short haul plane and a quick journey and the seat is perfectly comfortable.  Everything was clean.

We left a little ahead of time and the flight was smooth throughout with super efficient service from the crew. They offered complimentary soft drinks, tea and coffee, plus the most delicious little packet of twin cakes I have ever had on board. Two baby muffin style cakes with lovely fillings. soft, fresh and just the ticket. QUALITY!!!

Our seats could have been more comfortable with better legroom, but the flight took only about an hour so we did not have to deal with this for very long. The woman sitting next to me at the window went looking for a better location in the crowded plane and came back to say she was moving elsewhere.

We called the sales people and supervisors who kept telling us that the reason for our card being denied rested with our bank. We made calls to the bank and even went in person but bank people reassured us that our card was fine. Eventually, one sales person from the airline managed to get the payment through and we got the tickets. This went on for a 4 day period. 3 months later wanting to reserve individual seats, we tried to pay for those seats ourselves and through the sales people (over the phone) using 3 different bank cards but the cards kept being rejected by airline system. They referred us to the bank again. We talked to the bank again and they reassured us that our cards were fine. Eventually, two days later, one lady from the airline managed to push the payment through but, this time, we were billed twice. Trying to reason with the airline about it but to no avail. Went to the bank that reassured us that we were indeed billed twice. Spoke to airline again who denied billing us twice.

Expect nothing more than a budget airline,Havana,Paris,International,Air France used to be one the best airlines in Europe around 20 years ago.

Worst Airline,New York City,Malaga,International,"Ground crew at JFK were fine.  Problems started on the plane.  I have traveled on multiple European and Aisian airlines and English language skills were quite good, Air France crew is barely competent in English and some speak none.  For the most part the crew was rude.  Once meal service was over crew disappeared and don‚Äôt try finding any of them.  Food for a French airline was horrible, excess salt, undercooked rice, underripe fruit, hard rolls.  Outbound, breakfast was an almost frozen muffin.  On the inbound trip, a passenger had mold on her roll and trying to tell the flight attendant was an exercise in futility.  
My mother and I were in wheelchairs and we were abandoned near the assigned gate.  Trying to let the crew know, we were assisted passengers got us brushed aside 
because we were no longer in the wheelchairs. 
On the inbound flight, my brother had a problem with a passenger, who happened to be French, and the reclining of her seat and even after nearly spilling his coffe, he was made out to be the bad guy.  
If at all possible I will never fly Air France again.",2018-12,2019-01-04,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0
Avoid Air France at all costs,Los Angeles,Paris,International,"A late cancellation on Delta caused me to be re-booked in Air France from LAX to Paris, then Paris to Budapest. Delta assured me that Air France was a partner airline, so everything would be a smooth transition and I would enjoy the same extra amenities I had paid extra for with a partner airline. WRONG. Air France couldn‚Äôt care less about my priority status with Delta. The couldn‚Äôt care less about the extra money I paid for the upgraded seats. They acted like they didn‚Äôt want any of us on their airline at all. We got stuck in horrible middle seats in coach for the overseas flight. Once we got to Paris, their customer service got even worse. No one on the plane could tell us where to go for our connecting flight and questions about our luggage, and told us to go to customer service. We went to 3 different customer service desks until we finally found one that was open (this was mid-day on a Saturday). And by open i mean with only 2 employees sitting at a desk with 10+ seats/cubicles for employees. The line of people needing help was a dozen or more. One employee quickly left and never returned, leaving all of us waiting in an impossibly long line. Once we got to speak with the Air France employee, they directed us where to go and assured us our luggage was being loaded on our connecting flight. We got to the gate and the agent again confirmed our luggage was being loaded on our flight. When we got to Budapest, surprise surprise, there was no luggage. Air France had managed to lose the luggage! The Air France customer service employee in Budapest didn‚Äôt give a crap that they lost our luggage and refused to help. We had to go to the airport lost luggage department and file a claim. Fortunately, our luggage eventually showed up. Air France was horrible and I hope I never have the misfortune of dealing with them again.",2018-12,2019-01-04,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473
La Collection Air France: Inflexible et chere. Il est clair qu'Air France ne sait rien des voyages √† Cuba,Biarritz,Havana,International,"The flights were OK but we would have been better off had we booked them ourselves we would have at least been able to change them. 
The same might be said of the hotels. 
Transfers in Cuba were horrible and it is very clear that the have no experience of traveling in Cuba. 
We booked a 10 day trip visit advertised as an opportunity to Havana and to spend a few days on the Cayo Ensenachos. There is only one hotel on Ensenachos an all-inclusive luxury resort popular with Canadians but really an alien enclave 50 km away from the real Cuba (the main island). Transfers were organized so that Havana would become merely a transit stop-over, this was not communicated to us before we left, the schedule was blank and there were no people who could change anything in Cuba. Prior to departure we had tried to obtain information from La Collection Air France but this proved to be  miserable and futile. In the event we traveled in the bus from the airport to the Havana hotel and the early morning bus 32 hours later to Ensenachos. Everything else we booked and paid-for ourselves.
In conclusion the value of booking through the Air France agency (La Collection Air France) was extremely negative - they make you buy expensive exchangeable tickets which cannot be changed, they book hotels and don't tell you when you will stay in them and prepare a ridiculous schedule that you don't find out about until you ask the staff in the hotels in Cuba. 
The La Collection service is border-line criminal and should be avoided at all costs. I am sure that Air France will blame their travel partner in Cuba but upon enquiry we were consistently told that all of the planning was done in France and could not be changed in Cuba. Horrible, horrible horrible!
The flight out to Havana was fine but the connections extremely short, on the way back Havana to Amsterdam was miserable and one of our bags did not make it onto the last leg of the flight from Lyon to Biarritz (we were in Lyon for over  3hr).",2018-12,2019-01-04,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,2.0
Air France weighs and strictly enforces limit on carry on luggage at CDG airport,Paris,Houston,International,"Mass transportation is what flying is about these days.  Do not have high expectations unless you travel in business or first class.  My last flight was fine and the crew did a good job.  Air France however does something that distinguishes if from its competitors in an unpleasant way: at Charles De Gaulle Airport, the airline weighs your carry on luggage (two pieces allowed: bag and purse, for example) and STRICTLY enforces a 12 kg (25 lbs) limit.  If you go over, you are required to check the baggage in.  Based on its ticket prices, Air France clearly does not consider itself a ""low cost"" carrier and should therefore stop this practice.  Please note that I was not affected by this and am writing this review just to inform unsuspecting travelers.",2018-12,2019-01-04,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0
THIRD RATE AIRLINE,Mumbai,San Francisco,International,"My 18 year son Aayush Agrawal had to fly today evening by Air France to SFO from Mumbai early morning flight of 5th Jan. He is alone and not very conversant with flying complexities. 

The check in staff first told him he is on standby. My son has to report for his college so he requested to be accommodated. Then the staff has arranged for him a Jet Airways flight upto Paris and asked him to collect his SFO boarding pass from staff in Paris.

The Jet flight leaves only a 2 hour transit and all of this will get used up in organising a boarding pass and rushing for the next connection to SFO. All this on a Business Class ticket from Mumbai. There will be no time for any freshening up in such a long journey.

All this because the staff in Mumbai could get away with all this. Completely unacceptable and shoddy.

Horrendous airline,Paris,Panama City,International,"I have had a terrible experience with this company over the last two weeks - the worst flying experience I have ever had. 

I booked a direct flight from Paris to Panama in December. My flight was cancelled with no information from AirFrance and a number to call which apparently spoke English. There was no English option and when I got through to the French assistant, she rudely hung up the phone. My lovely hotel receptionist called back and eventually got me transferred to a flight the next day via Miami. AirFrance did not mention the need for an ESTA (and I had no intention of entering the USA, so this did not even cross my mind), and did not pay for my additional night in a hotel. The following day I could not check in because of my lack of ESTA. Staff were not helpful and often rude. I eventually paid for an ESTA myself (but was told I would be fully reimbursed for this and for my hotel) and just made the flight. The flight was then delayed, meaning I missed my connection in Miami. 

I had to go back to check in and get a new ticket, and eventually boarded a plane to Panama, arriving over 24 hours late, missing valuable time with friends and family. I contacted AirFrance for advice and they agreed to pay my hotel charge (but minus the tax for some reason) and 600 euros compensation, which is the amount given for just one cancellation or missed connection (I had both). No mention of the ESTA cost. I was given no goodwill gestures and the correspondence lacked empathy. I also expressed anxiety about my return flight, but was given nothing to assist with these fears. They could have at least given me airmiles or an upgrade - nothing!

When I landed a week and a half later back in HCMC, my fears were realised as my luggage was missing. I was told this would be delivered to my work, but it wasn't. The airport did try calling, but I was in a meeting. I still don't have my bag.

It is utterly shambolic how many problems have happened in just two flights and the little customer care demonstrated by the company. Profit is clearly more important to them than customer satisfaction. 

There were also numerous small incidences on board the flights - not enough staff, customers helping themselves to drinks as no staff were around, no toilet roll in the toilets, I was given a middle seat when I was told I had an aisle seat, it was NYE and there wasn't even a ""Happy New Year"" to customers on board.. etc etc. I urge everybody to avoid using this airline!",2018-12,2019-01-03,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0

Bad service,Paris,Berlin,Europe,"Starting from online ticket booking, I have been experienced bad services from Air France. Credit card charge is more than 10 AUD, so I had to choose to transfer the amount via bank account and had to wait for several days to get my ticket confirmed.
While at the CDG airport, self service check-in/bag drop is just a nightmare for passengers who have never used the system cause there is no staff there to help you. One of our bags was rejected by the system although we checked in the bag at the self service machine, so I had to wait for more than 15 minutes at the manual service desk, where someone was paying for extra luggages, but the manual process was just less than 30 seconds, I don‚Äôt know why there was no other staff who could help to do this quickly.
On the plane (operated by JOON), service was very slow, I looked at this poor young steward at the font, he had to get food for some passengers 4 times from the back before finally came to our seat to service our drink.

Nothing else to say - Bon vent,Paris,Los Angeles,International,"To Anne Rigail, Director of Air France

This is an official letter of divorce from an Air France customer that has flown 500k miles with this airline in the last 5 years, my daughters at age 5 and 8 are already Silver, so i can define myself and my family has very frequent travelers. I have been an active spectator of the decline of this airline during the last 10 years. In 2017 and 2018, i have had so many issues while traveling that i have reached the limit of being a good french and supporting the best i could the national carrier of my country. I am a business traveller travelling in Business. Let me relate you what drove me to write this letter:
- In 2017, 35% of my flights (12) had a mechanical failure which lead to several hours of delays, missed connections, important meetings missed without being treated like a platinum customers. For example in CDG, we were rebooked the following day and i was offered a crappy hotel far from the airport for which we had to wait hours a bus to drive us there. Do you think that they would have something special for their great customers? Nothing.  Same when your luggages are lost, no services even if it usually takes several day to recover them. They always blame the third party company in charge of the service. The last one in December 2018, they lost my snowboards for 2 days which ruined the first half of my snow trip. Have they apologized? Keep dreaming.
- The business class service and offering has declined: old and clunky in the A380, the new best is not comfortable at all (too hard cushion) with a cheap blanket and pillow. While other airlines like Lufthansa or Virgin Atlantic offer a mattress to put on top with a comfy pillow and quilt. The food is served on plastic tray via a cart service when few European competitors offer a restaurant type of service as they bring plates one by one and have multiple dishes per course. No internet on any flights while competitors offer the service on transatlantic flights for $15.
- The service is very inconsistent in the sense that sometimes they greet you and other they simply ignore you. It is very clear that the cabin crew does highlight the complete lack of procedures at Air France. Again on other airlines you get the attention that makes the experience better. Moreover the cabin crew constantly criticizes their company which is shocking to me. A good example is this flight attendant that told me that all Air France employees at the headquarter have no clue about managing the customer experience. I would agree but you cannot say it, what the F???
- The airfleet is very old which makes travelling above 8 hours very uncomfortable. I always feel my leg blooded and a feeling of physical discomfort. A good example is my last trip in December 2018: 20+ years old A319 between Rabat and CdG followed by a 15+ years old 777-300ER that had air conditioning issues leading to a very hot cabin. Whereas a month earlier i flew on Lufthansa a 2 year old A380 followed by a 747-800. The A380 is poorly maintained inside the cabin with broken seats, dirty toilets with quick fixes all over the place. They do not have enough oven so they cannot warm the bread which is chewy, what??? All this leads to a feeling of not being safe.
- The platinum customer service is not good, they are not helpful: tell you that your family is seating next to each other when not the case( my 5 years old was seating alone), inability to link travel reservations.... 
- i work in IT, and i can guarantee you that if i were the CEO of this company i would fire  their IT director. Their system simply does not make sense: if you fly with a young child you cannot checkin online, you fly with your family on same reservation and you all have different seats, system does not recognize kids and allocate them a kids menu by default( i would say that in 30% of the cases my kids dot not have their kids menu) and many more issues such as a very poor Air France Entertainment App ( you can simply not read the e-newspapers on an iPhone, the format is wrong), the app has a very poor rating on Appstore.
- Every time there is a slight turbulence, they turn on the fasten seat belt and announce it via intercom which wakes you up systematically. The pilots do not seem friendly (very brief and cold announcement or welcome message) or concern about the confort of the passengers as if may be a coincidence but i hit more turbulences with Air France than any other airlines with same travel frequency.
- And my daughter says that the kids menu is not good at all nor healthy.
I could continue but i believe that by now you get the point, nothing justifies to continue flying with this airline. I would let you make your own judgement but if you can , pick a different carrier. I almost forgot but every time i complained it took ages to have an answer and they give you couple thousands miles which is not the point of the complaint. Unfortunately we will have at least 5 more leisure trips in next 6 months with Air France but none of my business trip will be with Air France.

Definitely needs improvement,Hong Kong,Paris,International,"I did quite a lot of price comparison before I picked this airline for my flight to London with transfer at Paris, I paid extra for Premium Economy, so I thought how bad it could be? And it turned out quite disappointing.

First of all, they provided the big headsets instead of those little disposable headphones. Although they did provide disposable covers for the headsets in the amenity bag, but I was not sure whether the headsets were cleaned regularly, I dared not to put onto my head. So, I ended up watching the movie with no sounds. There was a plug there seemed to be for passengers to use their own headphones, but everyone is using bluetooth now! Who brings a wired headphones around? 

However, what annoyed me the most was I ordered the allergen free meal, as I couldnot eat dairy products and shellfish, and what I got was a cold meal with some  baby food probably made of apple. The flight attendant served my aisle just put down the food and gone, didn‚Äôt even give me a chance to say no for it! No hot drinks as well if I didn‚Äôt ask for it, as I was completely ignored when the flight attendent distributing food to other passengers.

Saved by a caring steward,Santiago,Paris,International,"Air France is a a good and reliable airline.  I travel with both this company and KLM very often and usually enjoy the experience. On this occasion, flying back from Santiago, Chile, a few weeks ago, I discovered that my seat was broken and would not recline.  The actual button for controlling the seat was missing.  As I was on a 13/14 hour journey, this was not a comfortable position to be in.  I had an aisle seat.  I mentioned this to one steward and this wonderful woman came down to express her great regret as my discomfort.  I did not sleep for the entire flight.  She could not have been nicer and offered to reset myself and my wife.  As it was only two hour from Paris at that stage, we declined her invitation to move. She then consulted her head purser.  As compensation, we were offered sixty euro.  I had paid 40 euro to reserve two aisle seat.  Perhaps the purser was too busy or self-important to deign to visit a passenger in economy class, but he did not make an appearance.  However, I will not forget the kindness or the professionalism of woman steward who spoke with us.  For that reason, I will continue to fly Air France in the future.

Worst customer experience ever,Dublin,Johannesburg,International,"We've experienced the worst customer experience ever with Air France. We've lost over ‚Ç¨10,000 and no one cared. We are flying back to Dublin now with another airline and will never fly with Air France again. 

We re a family of five-  2 adults, 3 children (ages 5, 8 and 10) left stranded in Paris with NO help from Air France. We live in Dublin and we're all excited to fly from Dublin to Paris and then we had a connection flight to Johannsburg, South Africa. Both flights were with Air France and in fact the girl in Dublin checked us and our bandage all the way through to Johannsburg.

However when we were just about to board in Paris on 28/12/18 at 23:30 staff went through the line pulling out anyone with children. We had to stand in another long line while they checked our documentation. Our passports were all in order and the kids were travelling with both parents so we didn't think we had anything to worry about. however then we were told that along with passports the kids also needed an original copy of their birth certificates. When we asked were photos / copies with stamps sufficient we were told no. We couldn't travel, stand aside and our bags would be taken off. 

The three kids were crying uncontrollably at this point and it was so upsetting. It was after midnight when we were told to go back through passport control and collect our bags. Our bags were no where to be seen and we were left standing in an airport with no one around, in -5'C cold and kids wearing tee shirts, shorts etc. There was no where to go. We walked up and down the airport looking for our bags or anyone to ask for help with 3 tired kids roaring crying. I will never forget it as long as I live. We tried every hotel and all were fully booked before finally getting a hotel at 2am.

At 5 am as I couldn't sleep I went to the baggage reclaim to try find our suitcases. After much stress they finally located our bags. I went to the ticket deck to see if it was possible for me to fly back to Dublin to get the birth certs and if Air France would put us on the flight that night. They said they would but it would cost us an extra ‚Ç¨8000!! PLUS the return flight to Dublin (+ E600)! We had already paid over ‚Ç¨5500 for our original tickets. We have now have lost everything our flights to South Africa, internal flights we had booked, our hotel bookings, Safari etc. and  Air France didn't help us in anyway. They completely washed their hands of us and just kept passing us to other people.

These new regulations from South Africa only came into forced on 01 Dec 2018 and our own travel agent (who we booked through) didn't even know about it.  We spoke to a supervisor asking if they would in the future warn people checking in from Dublin to have birth certs with them because if this had happened we could have gotten a  taxi home to get them. But instead we went all the way to Paris before learning about this new restriction on traveling with children. Air France won't even take on my simple suggestion and told us it was all our fault. They have to be the most uncaring, unhelpful airline with the worst customer service.",2018-12,2018-12-30,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

Agreed to change our flight which turned into a drama.,London,Johannesburg,International,"My partner and I were booked onto flight AF1181 on 11th Dec from Heathrow to Paris to then catch a connecting flight to Johannesburg. While checking in our luggage at just before 5pm, one of the staff interjected and said he was putting us on an earlier flight. I asked why and he said that there were spaces on the earlier flight and our later one was almost full. I said this was fine as long as he could ensure that we still had seats together on both the flights to Paris and Johannesburg as per printed on our original boarding passes. I explained it was important to be sat near my partner as I am a very nervous flier. He assured us we would be then said we needed to run to catch the flight. We also asked if our luggage would make it and he said it would and that he would have it sent immediately. 
We ran to the departure gate and only just made the flight to Paris.
We were not sat together as promised and when we checked our ongoing flight seats to Johannesburg we were not sat together either, in fact we were sat at opposite ends of the plane which I found very distressing.
I explained my fear of flying to the cabin crew who were very helpful and managed to get someone to change seats so I could be nearer my partner, the closest she could get me was two seats along from him.
When we arrived at the luggage carousel, our luggage was not on there. Our names were called out by a member of staff who then explained to us that our luggage was still in Paris.
By now I was very upset as not only had I had a very restless flight due to nerves, we now had no access to our belongings either. The staff were most helpful and apologetic and we were reassured our cases would be delivered to where we were staying with family. We gave over the address and contact details, including a mobile number.
The following morning, we called the number given for airport luggage and was told it had arrived in Johannesburg and would be with us shortly. We called again at 4 and were told it was waiting to be collected by a courier and was still at the airport. By 7pm we still had not received it. So we called again. This time we were informed apparently we had the wrong reference number and our luggage was being sent to Swaziland. We were then given another reference number. She then went on to say that it wasn‚Äôt delivered as they had no contact details for us. We gave our contact details again and was told we would receive our luggage on Friday then the line hung up.
I called back giving our new reference number and was informed we would have to wait another day as the couriers were no longer at work. I explained we needed it by first thing in the morning as we were travelling to Sun City. As well as this my partners contact lenses and medication were in the cases and we couldn‚Äôt go any longer without our belongings. My partner is the named driver on our hire car and would be unable to drive without his contact lenses. 
So I then asked if we could go to Johannesburg airport ourselves and collect it. We were told yes we could and they close at 10. We were also told we would have to bring our passports to claim it. 
We drove to the airport and collected it ourselves. 
Two days of our trip was ruined as we had none of our belongings. Without correct clothes, as the clothes we flew from England in were most unsuitable for the heat of Africa, we were unable to go out as planned. A wasted day staying indoors waiting for our luggage to be delivered. Also we had the additional cost of petrol to and from the airport as well as phone use calling the airport back and forth.

"Terrible costumer service, they only want (more of) your money",Canton of Geneva,Paris,Europe,"I had a terrible experience during my last flight from Geneva to Paris: 
I was not able to take my first flight GVA-CDG due to a professional emergency. When I arrived to the counter in order to take my return flight CDG-GVA, I was informed that my flight was blocked. Since I didn‚Äôt take my first flight, my return flight was blocked. After waiting for 20 minutes for an explanation the lady at the counter instructed me to go to the ‚Äòsales‚Äô office to see what they could so for me. Sales? I thought to myself, I don‚Äôt need to buy anything I bought my flight months ago. 
The second lady at the ‚Äòsales‚Äô counter informed me that my flight was blocked, interrogated about how did I manage to get to Paris, and informed me that if I wanted to flight, I needed to pay a penalty. Why am I being penalized for? A penalty for not being able to take the first flight I already paid for, due to an emergency! A penalty of 250‚Ç¨. 250‚Ç¨ penalty for a flight that costed less than a third of that, for a trip that I can easily take by train at a fraction of that price, I could have taken an uber and it would have costed less. 
Ok I get it, AF is a company and they only care about their dirty money. Yes, I know, it was in the terms and agreement when I bought the flight and I should know about this penalty. I can live with that. However, there are two disgusting issues with this policy that I just can‚Äôt stand: 1) How the hell can they prevent me from using a service for which I have already paid? And if I decide not to take my first flight, for whatever reason, how does that affect them? I have already paid for the flights! 
2) Secondly, and most importantly, how the hell is it possible that AF is incapable of letting me know that my flight is blocked and that I won‚Äôt be able to flight! They could have informed me of this (Via email, sms, cellphone call, or even their damn app) in at least two main occasion: 1) when I didn‚Äôt take the first flight. AF, don‚Äôt you think that you should check if everything is ok with your client? I could have had an accident, a family serious problem, or any other emergency (this time was only work) and you AF didn‚Äôt give a damn. Not a single message to check if I was OK or even alive. 2) Before I went to the airport like a fool, to take my return flight, letting me know that if I wanted to travel, I would need to pay 250‚Ç¨. If they would have informed me, I could have decided if I wanted to take the plane or not. Obviously, they do it on porpoise: most clients will have no other option than to pay the ridiculous penalty because they need to flight immediately. 
What is so despicable and disgusting of this whole thing? First, it is obvious that they only care about money and that their clients are just money givers (We know that‚Äôs how capitalism works, but could you at least pretend a little bit AF?). Second, I keep on receiving advertising messages from AF all the time!

Joon flights,Cairo,Paris,International,"I used the Delta website to book a flight from LAX to Cairo and back.  The return leg from Cairo to CDG was black hole.  The flight is operated by Joon, which is somehow related to Air France. Calls to Delta customer service was relayed to Air France and even they didn‚Äôt know much about class of service and seat assignments. When booking the flight I needed help from delta customer service to get an economy seat on Joon even though I booked a Delta One ticket.  No one at Delta or Air France could tell me whether a business class seat was available.

Even though the entire flight is booked at delta, Joon is not part of the Skyteam Alliance.  No miles or segments are earned on this leg.  Your Skyteam status is not recognized on Joon. A Delta One international ticket gives you the benefit of using the airline lounges except when you‚Äôre flying Joon.

"Business class journey, outward bound was amazing, homeward bound not so good",London,Pointe-a-Pitre,International,"The flight is in 2 parts, London to CDG Paris then an airport change to ORLY Paris.  As we were given free transfer vouchers not sure why these couldn't have been given out at check in in London or on the flight as had to go up to departures to collect from Air France desk and this airport is really badly sign posted.  The lounge at ORLY is not good for vegetarian food although the staff were extremely helpful in finding me some giving me vouchers to shop in the shop in the main lounge.  On the flight from London to Paris I was told that despite me having ordered a vegan meal option this was not available on short flights therefore I was unable to eat.  

The flight from Paris to Guadeloupe was great, comfortable, the staff were attentive, smiling and polite.  Food was excellent and there were enough movies to keep me occupied.  Shame the same could not be said about the return.  The in flight entertainment wasn't working, the vegan food I had ordered was in fact vegetarian therefore I could not eat most of it and it was not at all tasty and the staff were not as friendly.  At least the beds are extremely comfortable and as it was a night flight I could sleep all the way back to Paris.  On this leg we had been given our transfer voucher on check in so were able get the bus with minimum fuss to return to CDG where they have a fantastic lounge with great choices of food.

RUDE STAFF MEMEBERS AVOID,Paris,Birmingham,Europe,"o	When I left UK from Bhx none of the airline staff members or anyone at the airport asked me to pay for any baggage or luggage for myself and my wife. But on the return day from CDG the airline staff demanded that I pay for our same baggage/luggage that we brought along with us (even less heavy than what we came with initially). 
o	At the BHX the staff offered us complimentary food & drink vouchers on board but on the return they did not provide us any complimentary food & drink vouchers. When I asked, the airline staff stated that ‚Äúwe are not a charity service to give out complimentary vouchers to every customer‚Äù. But I would like to say that two fight attenders on the flight back from CDG both of them named Louise who did offered me and my wife a complimentary food & drink after I explained to them what happened and how I was treated by the airlines staff at the CDG airport. Which me and my wife are grateful for as they understood how badly we were treated.
o	The airline staff at the CDG airport kept blaming the staff members of BHX for not making me or my wife aware that we will have to pay for luggage which we came with. My question to the airline staff member was how is that mine or my wife‚Äôs fault that airline staff at BHX and CDG don‚Äôt have transparency in communication or not make a customer aware what they need to do or do their job properly. The response from the staff member at CDG was ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not my problem you can deal with that when you get back to BHX.‚Äù  
o	When I was trying to explain to the airlines staff at CDG about the luggage that I came with me, are they expecting me to bin my valuable items at Paris airport and fly back empty handed. The response from the airlines staff was ‚Äúyou cannot leave the baggage in the airport or atleast 6km within the airport premises unattended as it will be classed as dangerous or suspicious baggage and you will be prosecuted. ‚Äú(This is when I asked member of staff are you threatening me and the staff member did not reply)
I have also emailed the both managing directors for Flybe and Airfrance and they both forwarded the details to their complaints and they did nothing about this and Now I know why the their staffs are rude to the customers because they know nothing will happen or no action will be taken against them if they are rude to the customers. Because I will never use Air France or Flybe‚Äôs services ever again and I will make sure anyone I know does not use these companies also ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Terrible customer service! Airfance/ Delta,Amman,Los Angeles,International,"Terrible customer service!!
This is about my return flight..
I called AirFrance (Delta) on Nov28 2018 to reschedule my return flight from Amman to Los Angeles on Nov30 for a week due to medical reason. AF/Delta representative said that there‚Äôs a penalty if I want to reschedule and change the date and if the change is due to medical reason then I need to submit documents from the doctor or/and  the hospital for them to consider waving the penalty. I said that‚Äôs totally fine, and I would like to come back to this point later. I‚Äôll be gathering the documents needed but first let me know how much is the penalty! 
The AF representative started laughing loudly in a sense that I‚Äôm lying to him about the medical reason and sounded like he didn‚Äôt believe that I‚Äôm sick and having health issue and I‚Äôm just lying about my claim being sick and not able to fly. I was extremely shocked and felt so embarrassed about his behavior. Then he provided me with how much the penalty will be for 2 different dates.
I called back the next day and spoke to anothet rep and he helped me to reschedule the date and I paid the penalty with no problem.

How to Effectively Handle Delays During The Holiday Season: 2018 Edition,New York City,Milan,International,"I am writing re: Air France flight from JFK-CDG-MXP.  First off, Air France was 3 hours late departing from JFK.  The crew indicated that the fog was to blame but I think the crew could have cleaned the aircraft faster.  After all, this is what they do on a daily basis.  

As you may have already guessed, 3-hour delay in departure impacted our arrival at CDG, which caused me to miss my connection flight to Milan.  I appreciate that Air France took care of the booking but having to wait 10 hours for the next flight is totally unacceptable!  There were so many options!!!  There were so many opportunities for Air France to be proactive in this process.  Instead, they fell short.  

When I finally found the transfer desk in Terminal 2F at CDG, I spoke to one of the team members who genuinely wanted to help.  Quickly, he found one seat remaining on the 12:20 flight from CDG to Linate.  However, his request to put me on this flight was rejected.  He was advised that I cannot deter from my original destination, i.e. I cannot land at a different airport in Milan.  Why?  He couldn‚Äôt tell me because he also didn‚Äôt understand. 

So then this gentleman tried another option.  He found a different flight, but the seat was in business class.  So again, his request was rejected.  I would ask, why wouldn‚Äôt Air France bump someone else up to business class whom they thought was more deserving other than myself, so that I can have a seat in economy?  And why am I making suggestions that Air France should know on their own?  After all, this is THEIR field of expertise.

After running out of options, the gentleman encouraged me to speak to a supervisor, only there wasn‚Äôt one available.  He stepped out and I waited for the only supervisor to free up.  Unfortunate for me, my efforts were fruitless.  Soon as she finished with the family she was dealing with, she disappeared.

I decided to try again and asked one of the women to help me.  She wasn‚Äôt too keen on helping; she embodied the stereotype of a rude Parisian.  I held my tongue since I was technically at her mercy; I did not want to be stuck in CDG for 10 hours!  I pressed on and asked about different options.  She was insistent that I had no choice but to wait for my flight at 20:55 because all the flights were overbooked due to the holidays.  I asked about Lufthansa and she said that they were not part of the ‚ÄúAlliance‚Äù.  I then asked her about KLM flight (CDG-AMS-MXP) leaving at 15:40. She had advised that the flight was overbooked and that I would more than likely get stuck in Amsterdam.   I gave up soon after.  I asked for a food voucher since none was offered to me and walked away frustrated and dejected.

I am running on zero sleep in more than 24 hours.  More importantly, I will be losing all of today, 12/22, in Milan because I am sitting here in CDG.  I would love to imagine what would happen if Air France was more proactive in helping their clients.  It‚Äôs no surprise when I say that I am very much disappointed in Air France. 

Lastly, I am fully aware that there are cultural differences when it comes to customer service.  Based on my personal experience, Air France doesn‚Äôt believe that the customer is always right, but what happened to human decency?  I was not offered an upgrade on my flight to Milan OR my return flight to JFK (nonstop, thank goodness!).  I would like to know why. Is Air France really that stoic?

Awful treatment of loyal customers,Los Angeles,Paris,International,"Air France you have been the worst experience in my life. I had booked my flight from Los Angeles to Paris on Af 65 Departing at 3:30 pm on the 19th of December as premium economy. 

Since the flight got canceled I rushed to the airport 5 hours earlier, missing 2 very important meetings which were carefully scheduled prior my flight.

Disgraceful conditions and Awful Service,Chicago,Bengaluru,International,"I have flown back and forth to India several times on various airlines in both business and economy class. Air France was hands down THE WORST economy experience ever. We had an infant in the lap. On all other airlines this was accommodated with a bassinet in the bulkhead. When we called to book the seat we were told we had to request the bassinet when we checked in for the flight.  We thought this was odd because we had always booked this in advance before. But, we foolishly trusted the ticket agent. The first leg of our flight was on Delta and when we checked in they told us they couldn't make seat assignments in their system, we had to call Air France (like we already had). Nothing we could do but board the plane and hope to sort it out in Paris. CDG airport is a labyrinthine nightmare but, that's another story. We went to the Air France lounge hoping we could use it having just come off a business class flight for our first leg. They said that we could only have access to the lounge if our next flight was a ""short"" flight. Seems ridiculous that the length of your next flight would determine whether or not we could use the lounge with a same day business class ticket. We asked if we could buy a day pass (at the advertised 50 euro per person) but, they said they were full. They didn't seem full as other people continued to go out. They said ""sorry"" with a smirk on their face that showed they weren't. I don't know if it had anything to do with my being an American, my husband being an Indian, or the fact that we were dressed very casually (sorry, all our designer suits were all at the cleaners- ha ha) having just come off an overnight flight but, apparently they didn't think our 200 euros were worth it so that was that. When we were finally given seats on the plane we had the bassinet but, I was seated up front with the baby next to a male passenger and my husband and our 5 year old were seated about 12 rows back on the other side of the plane! Unless the flight attendent wanted to deal with my son running back and forth to mommy for 8 hours that wasn't going to work. My husband is fully capable of taking care of him but, it is kind of difficult to make a 5 year old sit on an 8 hour flight without both parents there to help. We ended up switching seats with the lady who was seated next to him and gave up on the bassinet. The seats were so small and close together with very narrow aisles. It was extremely difficult to reach for anything under the seat to get my daughter's diaper bag. Getting up to take my son to the bathroom was a full scale production. I think the cargo hold on any other airline would have been more comfortable than the Air France economy cabin. It was extremley hot/stuffy and there were no vents which could be controlled by the customer.  The plane was run down and filthy.  They made a big deal of spraying down the cabin with some noxious insecticide WITH passengers on board and later we saw a huge bug crawling around anyway. I have had TV dinners that were better than the food they serve. They didn't even bother to TRY and make it look appealing. There was hardly anything in the way of customer service. When I went back to ask for water I was told rather tersely ""there it is"" and the attendant pointed to some bottles and went back to chatting with her co-workers as if I had inconvenienced her and as if assisting me was not a part of her job. After the flight I did some internet searches to see if this experience is common and, apparently it is.  Many customers have said that Air France cares nothing for passengers outside the US, Cansda and Europe. I guess they think Indians who pay the same money as anyone are somehow entitled to less??? Wish I had figured this out before but, now I know. I have switched our return flights to another airline. If I can help it, I will never fly Air France again.",2018-12,2018-12-21,1.0,3.256587202007528,3.118511569731082,3.1219191587249426,3.0816201288738876,2.9329363835788156,3.4978647686832742,3.2173455056179776,3.0819906910132473

horrible quality of breakfast on flight back to Paris,Lima,Paris,International,"The breakfast served on the return flight from Lima to Paris was horrible.

Why didn't they serve croissants ???- which are typically french and of much better taste ! The tasteless pancake was stuffed with a tiny spoonful of minced apples, and the vanilla sauce to go with was also tasting very artificially. And an additional question: why does the Air Line staff start to serve breakfast in the very last minutes (11 hours' flight would give sufficient time to start breakfast serving earlier...) when the airplane is almost in the descending approach to Paris...",2018-12,2018-12-20,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0

Avoid Air  France and Chas de Gaulle at all costs,London,Nuremberg,Europe,Changed fight times after booking meant ridiculous connection times at Chas de Gaullle which has to be the most backward airport in europe .

Air France serviced by Delta is a long trip across the pond,Boston,Dublin,International,"When flying to Europe or anywhere out of the country i always look for an international carrier, saw this was Air France, by Delta.

The staff was friendly, the flight was on time, which is why i give it 3 stars.  It was adequate, but nothing above.  

Flying coach/economy on British Airways to London, or other overseas destinations easily gets a 4-5.  I would pay a bit more money for a truly international flight.

Don't fly AF. Horrible experience & non existent customer service.,Montego Bay,Atlanta,International,"AF flight operated by Delta. Our flight from Montego Bay to Atlanta on November 12, 2018 was planned for 4:42pm. Due to a technical issue, the plane didn't take off and another one was sent from Atlanta. 

The so-called ""rescue"" plane didn't take off from ATL before 8pm and we only left MBJ at 00:15 on the 13th. In consequence we spent the whole day at the airport (we arrived at 2:15pm). We weren't offered to stay in a hotel close by and I even had to ask the staff for something to eat. 

We landed in Atlanta around 3am and were charged a no show fee at the hotel. We also had to pay for the transport to the hotel as airport shuttles don't run at this time.

AF customer service that's supposed to take care of that refused to compensate us as it is a US company operating a US flight. Doesn't matter that we BOOKED from AF. Is it really our problem that they delegate the flight to a partner?

Even scarier: that ""technical"" issue was apparently a leak that prevented the plane to take off, however the plane just flew from ATL.

Emphasis on Service,Venice,Paris,Europe,"This flight from Venice to Paris left and arrived on time; the Economy section, where we sat, was well maintained; and the staff proved to be superb. The only drawback for the 90-minute flight itself was the severe lack of legroom. Even the small regional jets that we often fly offer much more space. The flight left at noon, so we appreciated receiving a complimentary sandwich.

Service on the ground became a bit complicated because of our tickets to fly from Venice to Nice via Paris, We had been unable to find a nonstop flight that day. The woman at check-in persuaded us to change our tickets and fly through Lyon, though that involved an additional wait in Venice of about 90 minutes. The upside would be avoiding a longer wait to connect in Paris and still arriving within 5 minutes of our original schedule. After leaving the counter, we noted that we were now on Hop, the airline‚Äôs discount carrier, which had not been explained.

As we waited in a snack shop for our flight, the woman from check-in appeared with boarding passes for Paris, explaining  that the Lyon flight was delayed. So we were back to the original plan. She went above and beyond to find us and to get us to our final destination in a timely manner.
