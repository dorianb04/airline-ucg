        "review_text": "After a long awaited time, my sister and I finally can and decided to meet in Japan for our dream trip.  I booked my flights with JAL, and I'm so excited!  I sent my itinerary to my sister so she can match my flights to meet at the airports in Japan.  It was really hard to sync up together to book our flights due to the time difference between us.  We finally booked everything and now my sister realized my return flight is departing from 2 different airports in Japan.  My return flight is from Osaka ITM to Haneda then from Haneda to Narita before flying back to Vancouver.  Why would I book a flight that makes me fly to Haneda and then have to go to Narita before flying home to Vancouver.  From Haneda to Narita I would have to transit there.  So I checked and there's another flight 20 mins later at 14:50 to fly from Osaka ITM to Narita and then from Narita to Vancouver.  So I called fully willing to pay a penalty or book another flight just from Osaka to Narita but the agent that I spoke to on the phone said I can't rebook not even with a penalty fee and I could not just book another connecting flight because if I don't follow my flight plan the rest of my flights will be cancelled.  This just doesn't make sense.  Also, the agent that I spoke with yelled at me and told me that  it was their policy and no one can do anything about it.  When I asked to speak to a manager they declined.  They said no manager can help me either and the only option I have is to forfeit my ticket that I paid over $1600 for and to rebook and pay another $1600 or book a flight which is $2600 from Haneda to Vancouver.  This blows my mind when I read other reviews online there's many reviews that this happens to many people and it's a complete money grab.  I don't align with Japan Airlines values, what a disgrace to Japan.  Japan is known for being courteous and kind and the service I received today is the complete opposite of that.  I'm fully willing to pay a penalty since it's my fault, or buy a connecting ticket to replace my mistake but the ridged \"policy\" (money grab) is completely disgusting.  If you are thinking about booking with Japan Airlines, DON'T!!!!",

I didn\u2019t manage to thank Arito-mi (if I got her name correctly). I was incredibly in distress, worrying that I will have to rebook my tickets and on top of the extra costs, worrying that next available flight would be the next day (because i checked online) - I live in Singapore and I do have to say that in our country, every thing is all about money and there is barely any empathy or \u2018go for the extra mile for your customers\u2019. Arito-mi was so very kind and instead of how usually customer service would \u2018brush you off\u2019, she calmly told us to hold on and had us seated aside while she checked what she could do for us to catch the next flight. To my surprise, instead of a SGD600 that I supposedly had to pay for a one way ticket back. We only had to pay less than SGD50 per person and the best part, it is a flight in next 3 hours. Later was handled by Sagya who handled our baggage check-in. I suppose she noticed my partner and I were seated apart, she made a call and shared to us that she had requested for seat reallocation so we could be seated together during the flight.\n\nI am incredibly touched by the customer service and the genuine initiative from both of them. From a very distressing situation over a mistake that is obviously of my own. Both Arito-mi and Sagya has warmed my heart after a sobbing time finding out I missed my flight. I am so glad that I left Japan in a good note.\n\nThank you to both of them and I must say they are a great asset to JAL. All the best and take care! I hope to come back to Japan soon!",

        "review_text": "My ticket was through American Airlines reward program, from Hanoi Vietnam to DFW, via connecting in Haneda airport.  My journey required a change of airport from Narita to Haneda in a 4 hour layover.  My online check in was denied using JAL app and website, so I show up on 11/30 to catch my flight departing at 11:55pm in Hanoi.  I was 2.5 hours early before departure which was plenty of time to check in, at the ticket counter, the attendant said I need to provide them with the ticket number in order to issue a boarding pass.  I show them my booking information on my phone in JAL portal and they said it is not enough and they must have the ticket number.  I told them the ticket was issued via a reward redemption with AA.  They said they couldn't help me and I need to contact AA to get more information.  I got on the AA chat immediately and was able to obtain the ticket number, I immediately provided the ticket number to the counter attendant, they were able to locate the flights but only could print the boarding pass from Hanoi to Narita, and said the second boarding pass will have to be issued in Haneda airport for departure to DFW, when I told them that I might not have enough time because the layover is 4 hours, they let me carry the carryon (even though 2 kg over the limit) rather than have it checked.  I do find that very nice of them for allowing me to carry on. \n \nHowever, the fact that they can't find my reservation unless I give them the ticket number is odd.  How can an airline not have my name or passport number to pull up the ticket information/reservations?   If AA chat was nonresponsive, I could have missed my flights.  \n\nI would say that the meals on both flights were very nice.  I chose the asian meals on both flights.  Flight attendants were all very attentive and courteous.  \n\nJAL needs to improve their check in process!!!  Although I did arrive on time and got on the connecting flight in Haneda airport, the delay in getting the boarding pass and the check in process could be improved.   I am giving 5 of out 10 stars due to the check in issue.",

I booked our flights in late May for a November visit and received an email confirmation.  I wanted to double check our seats in August and it's a good thing I did as there was no record of our booking despite a confirmation email and code!!  I contacted a JAL rep who said he could book the flight, but that we would have to pay for the flight again and get refunded later.  As the rest of our trip, including accommodation and trains were already booked, I reluctantly went along with this.  I later received a call  from the same rep who said he would get us upgraded seats on the outbound and inbound flights, but would have to pay for the upgrades upfront and that they would be refunded later.  At this point I was pretty suspicious and checked out the name of the rep, who was in fact, a JAL employee.  Long story short, we never received the upgraded seats!  The outbound upgrades were never recorded and the inbound upgrades were cancelled because the video monitors for both seats were not working.  Icing on the cake was that we sat under a vent on the inbound flight and were absolutely freezing for 10 hours.  We are still dealing with a cold/flu one week after returning.  \n\nAfter all this, we were told it would be \"one to two billing cycles\"  (i.e. one to two months) before our refund would appear on my credit card.  \n\nJapan was beautiful, but flying with JAL was an absolute nightmare with a lot of broken promises.  As of this date, I am still out $3600.  \n\nDo yourself a favor and go with any airline other than JAL.",

The only option they say is to pay a cancellation fee of $300 an error that was not my fault as I imputed my information to purchase a ticket and my passport details.  So, I have to pay a fee for their error and now I can't rebook at that price.  My option now is to pay $2500 with another airline.  I will NEVER recommend Japan Airlines and certainly will NEVER travel with them.

We were starving when we got to Tokyo! \nOn the return flight we made sure we weren't treated as vegans again and the food was a little better, but by no means equivalent in volume and variety as the standard food package.

We had the weird experience of one of us (as a couple traveling together) being almost completely ignored during the main meal service. The service started at 8:30 p.m., and almost 30 minutes elapsed between the warm towel and the appetizer, and another 30 minutes between that and the salad.  After that, others were served entrees throughout the cabin, including my spouse, but i was left waiting.  At 10:30 p.m., I still had not been served.  I used the call button to ask what was happening, but no one ever came.  In frustration I cleared my own dishes and took them to the galley, where there were 5 flight attendants gathered, clearing dishes.  They were shocked to see me.  I told them it was too late to eat and I wanted to go to sleep.  After that, 2 different flight attendants came to my seat and offered apologies and other foods, but there was never an explanation as to what had happened, if the entree was not available or if the oven was broken or whatever.  Neither FA was the initial flight attendant who had introduced herself to me at the beginning of the flight - she seemed to have disappeared.  My take is that it was a  mistake and I was just ignored or forgotten, but no one acknowledged that.  I notice that some of the flight attendants are now not Japanese, and I wondered if someone was in training or inexperienced or just not working up to par.  It was atypical of our experience with JAL and quite strange.",

        "review_text": "Just flew Japan Airlines from Australia to Europe via Tokyo. Booked Premium Economy seats almost a year in advance - and chose Japan Airlines specifically to secure Premium Economy seats for the long flight. Two weeks before departure, Japan Airlines phoned to advise that the aircraft had been changed and Premium Economy class was no longer available. Options were to make an already long journey longer by adding another stop in Europe in order to fly in Premium Economy or to downgrade to Economy. All arrangements for the trip had obviously been made by this time and we couldn't cancel or change carrier, so we reluctantly had to accept the downgrade. Again, booked 11 months in advance, they advised just 2 weeks from departure, and even had the nerve to suggest that we cancel our tickets outright and re-book, despite the ticket prices being far higher given that it was so close to the departure date.\n\nWe were told we would need to wait until the trip had been completed before we could request a refund. We were also told that the refund amount couldn't be confirmed until after the trip. We were provided with no receipts or paperwork related to the new ticket purchase, and as numerous reviewers already note, the website is useless for trying to manage your own booking.\n\nWe put in cash bids for upgrades to business on our return flight, having endured the long haul economy on the way over and dreading the return, but bids on both legs of the trip were rejected. Would have been nice if there had been a red flag on our booking to say that JAL had stuffed us around at the last minute and perhaps accepting our bids would go some way towards compensating - we weren't asking for free upgrades.\n\nWe get back from the trip after a very long journey in economy class and contact Japan Airlines to arrange the refund as we had been advised then the tickets were downgraded by the JAL phone operator. In short, Japan Airlines has now advised it will not refund any amount, as the economy fare that they booked in downgrading us was the highest cost / fully flexible fare that equated to the cost of the Premium Economy tickets. This was not communicated to us at the time of the downgrade, and we certainly wouldn't have agreed if we had known that the phone operator had discretion in which booking class the downgraded ticket was allocated - how dare you spend our money without permission?\n\nI spent ages on the phone talking with different people, who all advised that there will be no refund and there is no recourse. So we have paid extra for Premium Economy class, paid in full well in advance of our travel dates, to sit in economy, through no fault of our own and with this change being made two weeks before our departure.\n\nThis is our money that has been taken under false pretenses! We paid for something we didn't receive. Japan Airlines couldn't care less and has offered nothing. I can't go back in time to check the difference in economy and premium economy classes when I booked, but searching now for a similar time next year shows that premium economy is more than double the price of economy.\n\nWe would have expected a refund of maybe ~$1,000-1,200 pp, so $2-2,400 in total! This is completely unacceptable and feels like theft.\n\nInsurance doesn't cover it, because it's the airline's responsibility. Currently checking with my bank if it can help through the lens of products/services paid for and not received. We'll also check with ACCC around consumer guarantees relevant to flights offered by international companies that depart from Australia, but it doesn't look good.\n\nFor what it's worth, the on board experience is good but I'll never fly with them again.",

Delayed departed from Suvarnabhumi at 1 in the morning, during cruising flight attendants offered me variety choices of drinks of course I choose Apple juice but guess what? Free snacks napkins as well wet wipes, now of course I went to the bathroom and it\u2019s clean speaking of cleanliness seats were a bit exposed but that\u2019s fine the seats still comfortable, the in flight entertainment has a lot of movies and 5 games, 3 hours later the meal was served I got some kind of salmon porridge, a salad, strawberry yogurt, fruits and another salad, then flight attendant offered me the same variety of drinks but I choose orange juice this time but guess what? Silverware in economy, it\u2019s supposed to be plastic but the airline was very nice and gave me Silverware, then I enjoyed the meal after all it\u2019s delicious and tasty, then I watched some movies in the remaining time, then guess what? landed early overall I would recommend this airline since the meal is good, plenty of legroom, great seats and friendly service",

Flight attendants were very helpful as I have accidentally dropped something into the seat structure whilst I was asleep. Table was averagely large. I haven't used in flight entertainment but it is worth noting that if you are flying from or to Europe you should never pay for the wifi because It wouldn't connect to the satellite.

They speak only Japnese language. \nThe inflight entertainment (TV) is also playing japnese items. A very few old english movies. Forget about any hindi / indian movies or shows. \nBeing in the Business class, we suffered a lot. I can't imagine the condition of economy class passengers. \n\nI will highly recommend that, if you are travelling to japan, then please take Indian Airlines. \n\nCOMPLETE NO NO NO to JAPAN Airlines.",

I arrived at the airport and had a bit of a wait until the check desks opened but once they opened check in was quick and I was soon on my way to the lounge.\n\nJAL direct you to the BA lounge in terminal 3 but as they are a oneworld member you can you any of the 4 oneworld lounges including the Cathay which is probably the best and the Qantas lounge which is a close second and the AA lounge which is a distant last if they re open which they all were for my flight which departed at 7.20pm.\n\nMy flight left about 20 minutes late but arrived about 10 minutes early which to me is an on tome flight.\n\nThe service onboard was fine but like previous JAL flights I don\u2019t think the staff feel that confident when dealing with English speaking passengers but all the staff were great.\n\nThe meals were all nice as was the mid-flight ice cream which for a change on a flight wasn\u2019t rock hard.\n\nI am not a huge fan of their business class seat as while it is very private it does lack storage but is comfortable and I did get some sleep on the 13 hour flight.\n\nThe IFE when compared to Emirates lacks a lot of choice but was ok but I thought the amenity kit was a bit on the lacking side with no lip balm or moisturizer but it did come with a handy stand for your mobile phone.\n\nOverall an enjoyable and on time flight and I would fly them again plus they have a very generous luggage allowance which is helpful after a few months away.",

That's your problem I suppose.\n\nAll in all, I haven't even started my trip to Japan and Japan Airlines has managed to make everything stressful and troublesome. Thanks Japan Airlines!",

In Finland the flight got cancelled, and we sat there waiting for six hours before we got the final call about the flight being cancelled. They mainly gave the messages in Japanese, and didn\u2019t seem to care too much about notifying the other passengers in English. They also gave snacks and drinks to everyone else waiting but not to us (probably because we were not Japanese). Our trip was delayed two days, but they gave us accommodation and 20euros for food those days. On the plane they could also have been better at bringing drinks during a 14 hour flight, in this time we only got offered drinks about two times other than when we got food. Other airlines are a lot better at this.\nThe worst part of this whole case is the requesting of compensation. Since we are under the passengers rights regulated by EC261/04 we are eligible for compensation for this two days delay. You cannot reach them by email, you have to call. They will make you wait for hours(!!!) before they pick up the phone. And their phone line is terrible so you can\u2019t even hear what they say, this combined with poorly English makes this whole situation quite frustrating. It\u2019s doesn\u2019t even seem like they know the rules so they keep putting you on hold, declining our rights or avoid giving answers. I\u2019ve never experienced this poor service. It\u2019s probably a good airline when everything\u2019s goes according to plan and when you don\u2019t have to reach them though.",

My family has been faithfully flying JAL since the late 80's and have ALWAYS used JAL for trips to Japan to see family. In the future this will not be the case. We intend to fly on one of their competitors that also offer non stop flights and far more reasonable pricing and that does not charge exorbitant  prices for a change in  flight plans. The cost quoted to me to change the FIRST LEG of my round trip airfare is more than the original round trip airfare. This makes no sense, the flight I wanted to change to has many empty seats and will most likely have empty seats when it departs. JAL needs to examine the level of service it is providing. It would be cheaper for me to walk away from my original booking and book a new round trip travel.  Additionally my daughter and wife recently traveled to Japan and the food they were served on that flight was abysmal. JAL had been riding on old positive reviews and ratings from its customers. The JAL of today is NOT the JAL of previous times!!\n\nAnd one other thing, the website and the App are both absolutely abysmal. Neither of them perform well and the website does not allow you to search fir a round trip airfare now.",

Call centres or service counter refused to let my mother sit next to me to help me with the baby. I had two empty bassinet seats next to me and still they refused to let my mother sit next to me to help me. Also for some bizarre reason I was not able to book the bassinet seats when I purchased the tickets so had to rely on call centre and service counter. Do not trust the message on their website that says priority will be given to passenger with baby. They literally mean \"passenger\" in the singular form.",

But they did not give us seats  next to each other. They sell the window seats for extra money. So only 2 people can sit together, as result dad was sitting 6 rows behind the rest of the family and they were not willing to change it because window seats are paid. Tried to change it upfront by phone, by the seat reservation system, in the airport and onboard. No luck Very sad, daughter was crying for an hour... We've seen other families being spread over the economy class as well, so we were not the only ones.

Firstly I want to stress that the cabin staff are absolutely brilliant and although their English is average they do their very best to communicate with you. The 7 seats across each row in business is in my opinion too many. The seats are only slightly larger than premium economy and as a flat bed turning from side to side is difficult. Their pricing makes them an ideal choice for value seekers but if you are looking for a \u201ctrue\u201d business class experience then perhaps Singapore would be far better if a lot more expensive. The food on the flights was good especially the steak but the selection was only average. Lastly the entertainment available to English speaking customers is very poor and well below that of comparable airlines. I would recommend them for value and customer service but lacking in the refinements of some of their competitors.",

This was true, and in addition to very comfy seats, the staff and food were outstanding!! I also managed to get us an upgrade to business class on one leg of our journey, and the lie flat seats were something special. We were on a newer aircraft from JFK to Tokyo and it felt like First Class. I will def be flying with Japan Airlines again.",

I wanted an aisle seat so this was disappointing. On the flight the left side bathrooms weren\u2019t working so only the set on the right could be used. The toilet seats also looked like they haven\u2019t been changed in a long time. Given how clean the public bathrooms are in Japan the fact that the airline\u2019s toilets were old and nasty is gross. For flight back home 50 minutes before scheduled boarding received notice of a 5 hour delay due to aircraft rotation. What the heck does that even mean?  And if that was the case why not notify us earlier so we could have spent more time in Tokyo instead of at the airport. I really very disappointed in JAL. Will fly ANA next time.",

Also, when it comes to style, privacy and ergonomics, JAL seats in First falling behind the times when compared to newer First class seats with other airlines (however JAL A350 have newer seats).\n* TV monitors on board are not of highest resolution (behind when it comes to its competitors).\n* Bathrooms are nothing special and fall behind competitor First class offerings.\n\nOverall great experience.

One of my larger bags was severely damaged during travel, to the point that my large suitcase is no longer functional (the handle was crushed and no longer extends...see photos). When I submitted a claim, I was only offered a $75 reimbursement for a suitcase worth close to $200, not to mention the cost of the airline ticket for premium economy.

In my opinion, unrivaled in economy from all other major airlines in Europe, Middle East and USA. \n\nThank you JAL.",

But the worst part is the cabin service. While the cabin attendants are very polite, they are politely ineffective. A meal service takes 3-4 hours and in a 8-9 hour flight, lights are barely dimmed and if so, then hardly so for 1 hour or so. I buy business class tickets mainly for the flat bed and ability to sleep through a red eye flight but JAL makes that impossible. I would not recommend it to anyone.",

My wife, Judy Ng believes it is Michelin Star fine dining quality,  The effort and planning of the Food shows Excellent work by the chefs and staff.   Secondly,   I would like to commend the Stewardess Staff on both Flight JAL Flight 712 and JAL Flight 58 on June 12, 2024 on Business Class.

I believe me and my wife spoke to each Stewardess and were overjoyed with their kindness and service.   On Flight 712, we spoke to the Manager of the Crew I believe.  Thirdly,  I'd like to commend the JAL organization for their ability to switch my wifes non-window seat to an \"locked\"  Window seat on Business, and they were able to move me so that we were togeather.

What FANTASTIC coordination and Service !!   Thank you !!  We were met at the gate by JAL Staff person and she had a sign for  Ms Judy Ng ( Wife) and escorted to the transfer desk/Sekura First class lounge for re-ticketing.

Whether addressing passenger needs or handling unexpected situations, JAL staff respond quickly and gracefully, making passengers feel warmly welcomed.

The ingredients are fresh, and the presentation is exquisite, reflecting the chef's dedication in every dish. Although ANA's food is also good, it is somewhat less impressive in terms of taste and refinement compared to JAL.\n\nHardware Facilities\n\nWhen it comes to hardware facilities, ANA takes the lead. ANA's first-class seats are more spacious and comfortable, providing better privacy and entertainment options. The seat design is more modern and comes with a more advanced entertainment system and seat control features. However, it is worth noting that JAL is continually improving its hardware facilities. Although their latest first-class equipment has not been widely implemented yet, it is expected to catch up with or even surpass ANA in the future.\n\n Amenity Kits, Pajamas, and Slippers\n\nIn terms of amenity kits, pajamas, and slippers, ANA is more thoughtful. ANA provides high-quality skincare products and comfortable pajamas in their amenity kits, and the slippers are designed with great care, ensuring passengers feel more comfortable and relaxed during long flights. In comparison, while JAL's amenity kits are also quite good, they are slightly less impressive in terms of detail and material quality.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, JAL outperforms in service and food, offering passengers a superior experience. On the other hand, ANA excels in hardware facilities and amenity kits, focusing more on passenger comfort. If you prioritize in-flight service and food quality, JAL is a great choice; if you value seat comfort and privacy more, ANA would be the better option. Ultimately, the choice between the two airlines depends on personal preferences and needs.",

Checking in online was also a breeze, allowing me to avoid long lines at the airport.The flight attendants were friendly and attentive. If you are flying to Japan, take this airline.

What happens is you have couples taking both aisle seat in the centre arrangements and abuse the system.  They put in in the J seat with is the front seating.  The problem is that you share both tray an TV screen.  Instead of independently living the arm rest you could only lift one wat between two. The person next to me continually ripped open with such force. I could not sleep or get comfortable.  Not only that, the seat I was assigned to was not comfortable.  I saw at least four hours to go and I contemplated sitting on the floor.  Eventually I sat on the pillow and blanket to make it less stressful and relieve the pain from sitting.  Not only that they were happy to take other customers meal tray and refused to take mine. Anyway they blamed the travel agent and ignores the one world alliance sapphire membership.  Thus couples booked both aisle seats and paid for two seat and got three in return while I booked a seat which was nothing more than economy and paid premium prices.",

They could not upgrade us over the phone like every other airline could. Then they couldn\u2019t even seat us together via either the crappy app or on the phone.\nNext, when checking in at the airport after several failed attempts via phone we were able to upgrade. They told us the price would be 30,000 Yen each and we agreed. Then when they took us to another counter to pay they said the price is 40,000 Yen each. We told them the first check in ppl told us the 30k but they didn\u2019t have a clue and we just paid the 40k. So already feeling ripped off. \nNext the lounge situation. What a joke. If I had checked in on the app I was able to purchase entry to the Sakura lounge for us both and was happy to pay. But then guess what ? If you pay to upgrade your seat you are NOT ALLOWED to even pay to get into the lounge. Seriously? Wow. \nNext, I\u2019m disabled and had registered for mobility assistance. I can\u2019t walk far or stand for long so I need a wheelchair to the gate. I have been travelling all over the world registering as needing mobility assistance and never was asked why. Until today. The counter assistant asked me why I needed the wheelchair and if I was on medication\u2026 just wow. No other airline or country has ever asked these things. So right after explaining that she went back behind the counter said something to her coworker (the JAL employees all seem to work one job in pairs for some unknown reason)  and they literally laughed out loud at whatever she said. Now I can only assume that was at my expense. So so rude, so much for Japanese hospitality. \nNext, it takes two people to take us through security and customs, one to push the wheelchair and one to do nothing but supervise the whole thing. Very weird. So they say we cannot access any lounge and leave us our gate. As soon as they leave us, my wife goes to an information desk and they direct us straight to one of the lounges where we were able to pay and access. Again, seriously?? What a joke of customer service.",

JAL delivers top class service even in the cheap seats. \n\nIn flight entertainment had one of the better selections I've seen on an Asian carrier. And more logically arranged. An entire season of Kimichika Kazama Kyojo Zero was on offer, and soaked up flight time. Much better than scattered episodes of multiple TV shows. All the while, plenty of drinks and snacks were served.\n\nA paid exclusive meal is available on flights from Japan, and I had Kabayaki eel for the first time. One of the friendly flight attendants explained each of the dishes, and how to best enjoy them. I'm not an adventurous diner, but everything was tops. Was very nice to have someone guide me through the menu, JAL customer service is aces. As for the price, a bit on the high side at $30. A comparable paid meal on ANA is only \u00a52500, or just under $17 USD at today's rates. \n\nImpossible to choose between JAL and ANA. They're both very very good at making long haul flights bearable, even enjoyable.",

        "review_text": "We were so excited about our trip to Japan that we decided to splurge and fly JAL instead of the cheaper options. I ended up paying $2k for a round trip flight, more than I\u2019ve paid for any other international flight. I was told the experience was great and it was worth the price, but that was not the case.\n\nThe person I\u2019m flying with has status on Alaska Air and was able to choose seats. When I booked the flight, I wasn\u2019t given the option to choose seats. Fast forward to trying to check-in and I STILL didn\u2019t have a seat assigned \u2014 for an international flight that I spent $2k on! The person working at the counter was able to help me pick a non-middle seat but the experience was still stressful. Also, trying to find your reservation on their app is a nightmare. On my return flight I was never able to access it.\n\nI am a vegetarian option and picked this as a special meal option. The meals they served leaned vegan. I basically got mushrooms and rice on my way there (x2 meals), and some vegetarian stew and rice (x2 meals) on the way home, which I didn\u2019t even finish. The person I was flying with got margherita pizza for his 2nd meal and ice cream on the way there \u2014 which are both vegetarian and much better options than what I was served. I love airplane food and it\u2019s usually my favorite part of the flight. All the meals and snacks I had on JAL were disappointing.\n\nI tried to sleep on the way home since it was essentially an overnight flight but kept getting woken up by the flight attendants. This was also odd to me.\n\nLastly, the plane felt old and nothing special. I was hoping to be wowed here as well as I have been with other airlines.\n\nI will never be flying JAL again and would never recommend it. What a bummer.",

        "review_text": "I flew from Hong Kong to Osaka, taking Cathay Pacific from HK to Bangkok and then connecting to Japan Airlines JL728 from Bangkok to Osaka (Kansai).  After arriving at my hotel (Hilton Osaka) in Osaka, I discovered that one of the 4 wheels on my suitcase had been damaged such that it would not roll in certain directions, having been rammed in towards the suitcase and scraping the bottom of the suitcase when rolled.  I initially contacted Cathay since my luggage tag was issued by Cathay but they explained that airline rules dictate the last carrier in connecting flights is responsible for luggage.  I then contacted Japan Airlines and was initially told that any damage had to be reported at the airport before I left the arrivals area or JAL would not be responsible.  I reasoned with JAL that as Kansai airport provided luggage carts, I simply took my suitcase off the luggage carousel and put it on a luggage cart and never had to wheel it around until I arrived at my hotel.  Initially JAL staff stuck to their policy but thanks to some assistance in Japanese from the staff at Hilton Osaka (highly recommend!) and my pointing out that JAL's own website and the conditions of carriage shown on their website only indicate damage has to be reported to a JAL office within 7 days, JAL referred the matter to a manager and I was generously offered a replacement suitcase as a special favour.  In fact, when  staff initially contacted me and offered a replacement suitcase that was a zippered suitcase and I indicated my damaged suitcase was a hard frame suitcase and I would prefer that, staff actually worked hard to find me two other options that were hard frame suitcases to see if they suited my needs better. \n\nI had hoped JAL could simply fix the damaged wheel on my suitcase but JAL explained that repairs would take months in their normal procedures and so was not practical (Hilton Osaka confirmed the same for me by calling local luggage repair companies).  JAL also arranged to have my damaged suitcase sent back to them so that they could have parts of it recycled rather than simply thrown away by me, a very green step.  \n\nIt started as a frustrating run in with inflexible and what to me seemed like unreasonable policy, but it ended on a very kind and generous note with JAL going above and beyond to provide me with a usable replacement suitcase in a very quick timeframe. \n\nAs for the flight itself, I had a couple of hours connection time and used the JAL Sakura lounge at Kansai.  The lounge is quite large with lots of seating areas and a dining area where largely food is ordered from staff from the displayed menu and then prepared by staff and placed on a tray to be taken away by the guest.  The menu items look simple but the quality of the food is always very good and delicious. \n\nThe flight was delayed about 50 minutes due to the incoming flight being late due to bad weather.  The flight is an overnight flight scheduled to depart 12:55 am and arrive at 8:10 am.  Unfortunately, this overnight flight has always been operated with a B787-800 in a 2X2X2 configuration in business class with the Shell Flat Neo seat, an angled flat seat rather than a fully horizontal flat seat like the Sky Suite seat on other JAL long haul flights.  I had an aisle seat but as the cabin appeared to be about 1/3 empty, was fortunate to have no one sit at the window seat beside me and so could shift over to the window seat for more privacy when sleeping.  \n\nPrior to take off, breakfast orders are taken.  After take off, there is a quick service of a snack but most passengers opted to immediately go to sleep.  About 2 hours before arrival, breakfast is served.  Passengers have the option to skip breakfast and not to be woken up by the flight attendants but I think that is fairly useless as the lights are turned up and there is noise anyway from breakfast service to other passengers.  Therefore overall for an overnight flight, it is difficult to get much good sleep on this flight, particularly due to the angled flat seat rather than a fully flat bed seat.  \n\nNevertheless, as always with Japan Airlines, the service onboard is superb and the food is very good.  The toilets are always clean because the cabin attendants constantly clean and then neatly fold the toilet paper tip into a triangle.  This is a good solid overnight flight and a good use of time.  But it is not an ideal flight to sleep on due to the older angled flat seats and the configuration that requires the window seat passenger to step over the aisle passenger for access.",

Bathroom even has a bidet seat.\nCheck-in went smoothly once you realized that you get your baggage tag from a kiosk before going to the dedicated Premium Economy line. \nSeats reclined within a shell so they do not lean into the space behind (or in front of) you. Motorized recline and leg rest controls, with a foot rest. Spacious unless you have a lot of things in the foot well.\nEntertainment system was efficient, but I found the selections a bit limited as I am current on most movies and am not Japanese and so do not follow their TV series. Ended up listening to soft music to sleep to. Airline provides noise-cancelling on-the-ear headphones which did a fair job of masking plane noises.\nMeals were similar to what I would expect in Economy, although you were able to request small servings of instant ramen noodles and they handed out steamed buns (red bean filling?) during the flight.\nFlight attendants came by often and were very pleasant.\nAs I was able to pay with Alaska Airlines miles, at a very good rate, this flight was a great value (thanks point.me), based on a suggested rate in a review of this flight segment by someone else.",

We ended up having to spend an extra $300 (USD) to stay the night in Tokyo. When asked if we could get vouchers or even an upgraded seat they said the delay was \u201cnot their fault\u201d and therefore not their responsibility to reimburse us even though it was their fault. The attendant originally stated the delay was due to weather, but when we corrected her she checked the information and confirmed it was not due to weather but still denied it was their fault. Overall, really poor customer service and will likely not fly with them again.",

        "review_text": "I connected from Narita to Haneda airport at Tokyo to take my ovenight flight to Bangkok on Japan Airlines JL33.  Transfer from Narita to Haneda was easy on the limousine bus with frequent departures.  However, it took a bit longer than scheduled due to late afternoon traffic.\n \nOnce I arrived at Haneda, check in was quick using the First Class check in and I was quickly into the superb Japan Airlines First Class Lounge at Haneda based on my OneWorld Emerald Status.  The lounge is very spacious with a very large dining area on the main floor with a side seating area, and then upstairs there is a salon bar area serving drinks including the previously hard to obtain Suntory Yamazaki 12 yr premium whiskey.  There is also a separate area upstairs with several massage chairs that offer pre-set massage programs lasting about 10 or 15 minutes each.  The lounge is mainly set for ordering using the QR code on your table, with a few self serve items such as coffee and cold drinks, buns, rice and the trademark JAL curry, and several canapes. The food is beautifully presented and delicious and definitely fine restaurant worthy.  I enjoyed a pork filet with pepper paprika sauce and phyllo wrapped scallop with sea asparagus.  Of course, I did not pass on ordering sushi made to order by the sushi chefs.  If you have access to the Haneda First Class lounge, you will want to go to the airport early to enjoy its elegant ambiance and superb dining. \n \nMy overnight flight to Bangkok was operated with a B787-9 fitted with the Sky Suite III seat in a 1X2X1 configuration.  The seat is fairly comfortable but there is not much storage around the seat for your things and the seat is fairly narrow in flat bed position.  As it was an overnight flight, most people opted to sleep as soon as the flight reached cruising altitude.  If you opt to be served breakfast, you will be woken around 2 hours before arrival for breakfast.  Western breakfast is not a strength for JAL so I opted for the more filling Japanese breakfast which came with a bento box with 5 sections with fruit, pickles and various different small bites and then a main of flounder with vegetable sauce and rice.   As usual, it was beautifully presented and delicious.  \n\nThe flight landed on time at 5:05 am,  Bangkok Suvarnabhumi airport has a sprawling terminal so it is a fairly long walk to immigration.  Due to the early arrival, only one immigration desk was opened for business class passengers and there was a fairly long line up of maybe 20 people by the time I got there.  Fortunately shortly afterward authorities opened up a counter for elderly and those with children and I and a few others in the business class  line were ushered over to the new counter since there was no one there.  I was at the luggage carousel by 5:40 am, out into the arrivals hall by around 5:50 am and quickly into a car to my hotel soon after that.  \n\nAs always, JAL provided excellent service and delicious food on the flight.  It is definitely one of my favourite airlines to fly with and I would always recommend it to friends.",

        "type_of_route": "International",
        "review_text": "I flew JAL from Vancouver to Tokyo Narita.  Japan Airlines does not have its own lounge in Vancouver and uses the Plaza Premium lounge.  That lounge is under renovation so Plaza Premium currently uses a temporary space, just an open area that is cordoned off.  The temporary lounge is very bare basics, offering simple food and drinks served on paper plates and using disposable wood cutlery.  As Plaza Premium is also a pay to use lounge, the space can get fairly crowded.  Just lining up to get in took a while as the person in front of me was trying to pay to get in using a discount that is only available on the app. \n\nThe flight is operated with a B767, an older plane.  Business class has the Sky Suite II seats where the window seat alternate with being right next to the window with a counter next to the aisle on the even numbered rows or having a counter next to the window with the seat being right next to the aisle instead on the odd numbered rows. The cabin is configured 1X2X1 with all seats having direct aisle access but with the even numbered row window seats having greater privacy with a counter between the seat and the aisle.  I find the Sky Suite II seats to be quite narrow at the shoulder when reclined to flat bed position because the armrest does not lower down, and much prefer the original Sky Suite I seats which are wider at the shoulder in bed position and has greater privacy due to its layout. \n\nOlder plane and less desirable seat notwithanding, JAL flights are always a pleasure because the food and the service are consistently excellent.  Every flight seems almost like a constant competition between passengers and the cabin attendants as to whether the next passenger can get to the toilet first or the cabin attendant will get there first to clean up the toilet for the next passenger's use!  I have been on 10 hour flights with JAL where there was never a time I went to the toilet without finding the cabin attendant had already tidy up the toilet and folded the toilet paper into a neat triangle point.  \n\nI usually opt for the Japanese meal since they are always very filling, delicious and beautifully presented.  This flight I opted for the Western beef offering for a change - a starter plate of grilled chicken, prosciutto and salad, and a main of beef tenderloin with stroganoff sauce and pumpkin and pine nut puree.  The meal was very good as usual but I confess I miss the beautiful presentation that the Japanese meal would have had.  Dessert was chocolate fudge cake which was fine, but I always thought Japanese chocolate desserts tended to be on the light side and lacked the strong bittersweet chocolate taste I prefer.  JAL now also offers pre-flight meal reservation for an express meal or a vegan vegetarian meal supervised by Chef Yonezawa of the Japan restaurant No Code. \n\nOnce again, I enjoyed my JAL flight and felt extremely well cared for by the cabin attendants.  I happily recommend JAL everytime and the small deductions are for the older plane and the third party temporary lounge.",

On the next day, they charged me for $7k for 3 tickets one way from Tokyo to Ho Chi Minh City (normally cost around $1k). After negotiation, they gave me the boarding pass. 15 minute before departure time, they suddenly asked for my daughter\u2019s health check by a doctor, which they did not do for 5 hours ago. So I obviously could not fly that plane. Damn. They want to make money from me. That was a horrible memory.",

Once in Sapporo, I was told that it was not a business class seat, despite being 'Class J' which internationally is considered as business class, and despite SeatGuru showing the business (NOT Premium Economy) label on the aircraft plan (image attached). \nSo they are selling under 'Business' (now the app shows 'Class J') something which is not even Premium Economy. Here are the 'benefits' of this class:\n- NO lounge access\n- NO priority boarding. You are actually boarding LAST, I kid you not. You're in Group 5 \n- Catering: 2/3 glass of cold green tea, nothing else, over a flight > 1h30. Any other airline does better\n- NO priority baggage handling (ours were delivered towards the end of a 200+ passenger service\n2) Disorganised:\nIt's a nightmare to access the app as a guest if you're not a JAL member\nBoarding is a complete mess, self-checking, self handling of luggage\nYou receive information emails in Japanese!\nIn the lounge, the staff were completely out of their depth. When I complained about the situation, their first reaction was to give me a lecture on the back of en envelope on the various flight classes! When I moved on saying that I would not insist on accessing the lounge but wanted the coordinates of customer relations, they suggested that they would process the complaint themselves!\n3) Disappointing:\nChaotic boarding, and you are boarding last\nFull fare but half service - better fly JetStar!\n... this is supposed to be a Skytrax 5* airline? NO WAY!",

After an hour on the phone , we were told there is nothing that can be done, no one else to talk to and we just have to accept the seating plan. Japan Airlines think it is acceptable to split up a family and have strangers sitting next to young children.\nI wonder if any of the management or board members would allow this to happen to there family?",

As a result we had to book economy class - if we weren't going to Japan I wouldn't have booked them at all.

She asked, three different times, \"what my symptoms were.\"  I stated alternately that I was 1)too weak to walk to the gate 2)my leg muscles were too weak for me to walk 3)I was disabled after a hospital stay.  After her third repetition of the same question, my boyfriend asked her if she was a doctor.  She said no. He then asked if she would like to speak to the doctor that had treated me, and started to dial his number. She panicked, said no and called a supervisor.  \nThe supervisor said \"I just have one more question\" and then asked me, you guessed it \"what my symptoms were.\"  At this point I assumed we would miss our flight and would not be given our passports back, so I said, in desperation, that my muscles were too weak to walk to the gate, I did not have a contagious disease, I was not a danger to their passengers or crew, I was not going to die on their airplane and that I was now extremely angry.\nThat finally got our boarding passes issued and our passports back.  The flight itself and the onboard service and amenities were excellent. I grieve for people who use wheelchairs all the time and the humiliation they must suffer.  Shame on JAL.",

He can\u2019t sit straight on the way back so we asked JP to upgrade economy to business class and we pay the difference. They said no. Okay, then we asked if we can cancel for medical reason, get a refund and purchase a new ticket for business class. They said yes on buying a new ticket with no refund. Fine!\n\nThe day we arrived at the airport to check in, they told us the economy seat that we paid for is now cancelled without refund for some safety reason. And that reason is for them to sell that seat for someone else! I\u2019m speechless! \n\nAt the same time, Expedia has not tried to help over the matter. Both Expedia and JP told us to contact the other party for the matter. None of them want to refund or help us to upgrade. \n\nI know it would be a lot if you book everything for your vacation separately, but next time I rather take my time to do that on my next trip, than have to deal with this headache, on top of the fact that our family is exhausted on this trip.\n\nNo one expects their vacation turn into a nightmare but craps happen and here is our story.",

        "review_text": "I flew recently on JAL Premium Economy from Sydney to Helsinki and back, flights 52,47,48 and 51.  I found the seats on the JAL Premium Economy extremely uncomfortable, even painful.\n\nI\u2019m a seasoned air traveller with Silver for Live from Qantas.  I flew Premium Economy with Qantas and Cathay Pacific and I believe the JAL seats are some kind of a design mistake.  They don\u2019t recline in the usual manner, just the bottom part, the seat, moves horizontally forward and the back support, being mechanically connected, attains a more reclined position.  The seat then attains a very unergonomic shape, not compatible with a human body.  This arrangement also automatically reduces the passenger\u2019s legroom, increasing the discomfort even further.\n\nThere are only two buttons to operate this contraption, one for the \u201crecline\u201d movement and the other one for the lower leg (calf) support. However, the lower leg support doesn\u2019t function at all due to its low range of motion.  So, it just hangs there.  I couldn\u2019t find a comfortable position and couldn\u2019t sleep at all.  The seats are also very hard and my bottom still hurts a week after the return flights.\n \nI find it hard to believe the Japanese people, renown for their design prowess and attention to detail, installed these seats on their national carrier!\n\nOn the other hand, the service was superb and the food exquisite albeit a bit small on size.  I also believe, the food was the same as in the economy class.",

        "review_text": "Could have flown with cheaper airline but wanted to try JAL. Flight was a morning flight.Flew on 777 economy JAL wider seats. First problem was checking in at Haneda, I had checked in online and all 3 boarding cards were on my mobile, we asked for printed off cards but we're told no. You had to do your luggage labels and place on conveyer belt and scan mobile boarding cards it wouldn't read ours, ended up a ground stewardess had to print off paper boarding cards for us for the scanner to work. I saw the queues getting longer as a lot of people seemed to be having problems, Haneda security queues ran right through the self check in stations so the place was very chaotic and people not knowing what was happening, so unlike the usual Japanese efficiency you experience everywhere else. On the plane now seats weren't noticeably any wider but legroom was really good. Flight entertainment was very poor, very limited choice of films, screen wasn't very big, seemed very dated with a pull out handset to control as touch screen didn't work. When seatbelts light went off they came round with a bag of mixed rice crackers and a bottle of water. After about an hour trolley came round with lunch and a choice of wine which wasn't very chilled, beer was and soft drinks. Handed a large plastic menu between 3 of us at time of serving, choice of pork or chicken...had to make your mind up quick, chose pork it was ok , served with rice but nothing like beautiful meals we ate in Japan, also had ice cream, no bread or cheese and biscuits, just some little dishes of tofu, cold broccoli , salad and some other cold veg, only ate some if it, very disappointing. After 4.5 hours into the flight they dimmed the lights and a steward walked round with a pole pulling down any window blinds that were still open, it stayed like that for hours, he walked around the cabin constantly looking in each row for?? to check we were sleeping? I felt I was in a nursery and being put down for my afternoon nap. They closed the curtains round the galley and only came round regularly offering green tea. About 7 hours into the flight the lights went on and we were handed a horrible milk tea flavoured kind of cake with white chocolate chips which was very dry to eat then offered coffee or green tea or soft drink. Now 7 hours into the flight we still had not been offered any trolley service offering alcohol other than at lunchtime . My husband went up to the galley and asked for 3 gin and tonics and the steward replied with surprised 3, my husband replied there are 3 of us... 1 each, when the male steward brought the drinks to our seats he never said a word but frostily sat them down with a napkin and another packet of the rice crackers. 11 hours into the flight my husband again went up to the galley and asked for 3 drinks but this time he was attended by a pleasant female stewardess, smiling, she brought them to our seats smiling. Half an hour later they came round the cabin with a drinks trolley offering alcohol drinks for the first time during the flight with only 2.5 hours before landing! At no time did they suggest to visit the galley for snacks or drinks, you had to decide that for yourself and depending on who was there how you would be treated. About 1.5 hours before landing they brought round something to eat, it was in a takeaway box and you had to open containers and mix it all up, chicken and noodles but it surprisingly good. Definitely wouldn't fly with JAL again, we flew Singapore airlines last time to Japan, economy was like first class, meals, service, entertainment nothing was a bother to them and they constantly came round with drinks and snacks trolley and toilets were immaculate, JAL toilets were just ok and extremely small.",

It's not western, it's not really mainstream Japanese. It was odd and definitely not suited to kids (even the kids meals!). Our kids left almost all of their meals, and most kids trays I saw went back full. We were glad we had some snacks packed for the kids. When I asked a hostess on the Narita - Melbourne flight if they had any bread rolls or snacks for the kids, as they had not eaten their meal, she simply said \"no\" and that was that! \n\n2. The online system for checking in is clunky when doing it for a family. AT points we ended up with all boarding passes on a single phone but their system at the airport requires everyone to have their own which didn't work (our kids are too young to have phones). They printed us out boarding passes in Narita when we were coming back to get us through one gate, but then refused to give us the boarding passes which meant we had the same issues later on in the airport. \n\n3. The entertainment system is sufficient but most other airlines have far better entertainment options and variety.",

They dump you off at the bottom of those air stairs,  so there is a  rowd of people with their carryons and shopping bags on the tarmac now have to climb the stairs.  Those old folks who have problems walking with their carryons and shopping bags, you can imagine the number of steps to get to the door of a widebody...  very fascinating sercie... free exercise workout in hot humid haneda.  \nGates 131 through 139.

        "review_text": "Wife and kids flew JAL from Finland to Haneda. I pre-booked their lounge passes with JAL Sakura Lounge. After a 14 hour flight, all they wanted to do is shower and have rest before the next flight which is in 5 hours time with another 9.5 journey to Sydney.\n\nThey went to the lounge front desk, they were denied entry. The lounge entry only allows entry 3 hour prior to your departure time, so if a flight takes off at 7pm, you can only use lounge at 4pm. However planes that take off at 7pm usually board at 30 - 45 min before take off. Basically you get ripped off for your lounge pass, paying for 3 hours and only allow to use 2 1/4 hours.\n\nWife asked them if they can set a timer and use the 3 hour and checkout themselves. NOPE, they wont allow you. Wife was really unhappy and tired so she gave up arguing with the front desk staff.\n\nSo I rang and spoke to JAL in the Australian phone line spoke to the phone consultant to lodge a complaint. The guy was very nice and I explained the situation and ask why the logic of paying for 3 hours but only get to use for 2.5 or 2 1/4 hours in lounge. He couldnt answer my question. I asked for cancellation of the lounge pass and get refund. He could not get a refund as they don't refunds apparently. What third world country is this?\n\nSo asked him to lodge a complaint for me and he said I have to use their website to lodge a complaint. He also can lodge a complaint. He said that all calls are recorded. I asked if all calls are recorded, what's the purpose of recording the calls if you cant use it to provide feedback. He couldnt answer the question.\n\nIam disappointed with JAL. Their lounge access timeframe has no logic what so ever. Also What third world country technology do they have working there, can record a phone call but cant use the recording as part of their complaint process?\n\nThis will be my first and last time using JAL. Customer service is so poor!!!!",

On entering the aircraft , the crew guided us to our seats.\n\nSeating / Layout : Similar to our previous flight , this too had a 1-2-1 layout with  reverse herringbone seats. Comfortable , with all functions working perfectly fine. The only flaw - tight seat belts , with multiple passengers requiring extenders.\n\nService : Not as great as our previous flight , but good nevertheless.\n\nFood & Beverage : We chose the Japanese meals yet again , which were well presented.\n\nArrival : All the luggage was being dumped on the ground by the high-headed airport staff.

        "review_text": "I flew on Japan Airlines from Narita to Vancouver.  Prior to the flight, I used the JAL First Class Lounge at Narita based on my OneWorld Emerald status.  The lounge offers excellent food and service, I tried several dishes by scanning the QR code at my table and ordering and each was beautifully presented and delicious.  Special dishes included appetizers of Serrano ham with figs, marinated squid and marinated algae, and Manpuku Chinese soba noodles from Manpuku in Ginza, one of the oldest ramen shops in Tokyo.  At the main eating times, there are also sushi chefs making sushi to order.  There were also two different champagnes on offer - Joseph Perrier Brut and Pierre de Bry Brut.  There was plenty of seating in the lounge and in the dining area, and even a couple of massage chairs that offer a number of preset massage programs.  The lounge is an excellent pre-flight experience and most comfortable and relaxing before a long haul flight. \n\nThe boarding of the flight to Vancouver was delayed due to cabin preparation issues.  Fortunately the delay was only 10 minutes and the plane managed to make up the time in flight arriving on schedule. \n\nThe flight is operated with an older plane - B767-300.  Business class used the Sky Suite II seats in a 1X2X1 configuration with the window seats alternating between being separated from the window by a counter in the odd rows and right by the window in the even rows.  The Sky Suite II is not the most comfortable of seats as in bed position, the armrests do not lower down and therefore the bed is very narrow at shoulder level.  Therefore, I found it more comfortable to sleep with the seat in an incline position rather than fully flat.  Entertainment system is not a JAL strength so while there were enough movies on offer and some quite current, it was quite limited.  There were a lot of Japanese movies and TV programs that were either only available with English subtitles or not available with any English at all. \n\nIn flight service, as always, was elegant, understated and attentive. Meals served on board were delicious and, once again, beautiful to look at.  I had the Japanese dinner which starts with a bento box of many different items and then followed by a dish with three separate mains.  Japan Airlines is unique in that it offers a special coffee in business class for each flight, with a full origins and tasting description in the onboard menu just like for wines in a wine review.   The one for my flight unfortunately had high acidity, which I do not prefer, but fortunately it was also a rich coffee and very very smooth. \n\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed my flight with Japan Airlines.",

Our first flight on the 28th of July 2023 had a flight no: JAL914 from Naha to Tokyo (Haneda) with planned departure at 15:30 which was significally delayed.\nBecause of the delayed, we've missed our shuttle bus to Narita which we paid for and departed 19:25. Already on the plane (flight JAL914) we've notify the crew member about our problem. We kindly asked if we could get our luggages one of the first on a belt so we'll have a chance to catch the bus. Ironically, our luggages came out as the ones of the last.\nThen I approached the JAL personnel to present my problem and ask for potential solutions. We supposed to picked up our additional lugguages from currier \"Yamato\" and catch flight AY 0074 to Helsinki departing 23:05 (Finnair/JAL).\nIt was then , I've realized that I'm dealing with polite bench of kids where nobody speaks English. I understand it's very normal if we talking about local grocery store, but travel company STASION AT AIRPORT with no single person able to communicate with foreigner?\nThat's very low, cheap and armature to me.\nWith precious time on table I waited long time for somebody who supposabely speaks English, but then communication were bumpy and unproductive turning our already bad situation to even worse to waste more time.\nLet me point that I was asking for supervisor from the moment I approached the JAL counter which eventually I wasn't able properly to speak with. I was forced to take a TAXI and when I sat in, I've finally  saw the supervisor. With no second to spare I've just told her that I will complain about that.\nThe circumstance created by JAL cost me \u00a530 000+ for TAXI to Narita and tons of stress for whole family along.\nWe consulted JAL customer service before we choosing a ticket and we were ensured that everything should be OK with those we had.\nI also believe that air ticket also includes an airport fees like; taxes, security and others.\nIt was not our fault that flight was delayed but with absolutely NO HELP FROM JAL it became our big problem.\nI should mention that my wife is Japanese and we used JAL quite much until now with satisfaction, but after recent experience which is every traveler worst nightmare I don't think I will look positive at Japanese Air Lines.\nThe e-mail will be forwarded as a copy to whom it may concern.",

        "review_text": "Check-in : At the dedicated Business Class desk , which unlike many other airline counters at DEL , was being used only for the said passengers. The entire process took barely a few minutes , just how it is supposed to be.\n\nImmigration / Security : Via the dedicated First/Business Class lanes , which took 5-7 minutes in total.\n\nLounge : The makeshift lounge at the Holiday Inn Express hotel. Nothing worth mentioning , apart from the amazing views i.e. much better than the dingy claustrophobic lounges DEL is infamous for.\n\nBoarding : Streamlined , with Business Class passengers being called as per the Priority category. Once inside the aircraft , the crew was proactively guiding the passengers.\n\nSeats / Layout : 1-2-1 in reverse herringbone fashion. The seats are comfortable , with the functions working perfectly fine. The only flaw being the seat belts - too tight for everyone I suppose , with a number of passengers requesting for extenders.\n\nService : Very friendly , courteous and consistent. No flaw at all. One of the best crews we've seen in the post-Covid world.\n\nFood & Beverage : We went for the Japanese meal , and it was good to taste & presented very well. In short , we had no regrets about our choice.",

I\u2019m traveling in a family of 6 and we\u2019ve all collectively agreed that Japan Airlines has, quite possibly, the worst both in-flight and out of flight service. Buying Business Class tickets gives you zero priority, unlike stated. The flight provides no drinks, and when we ordered the beef from the menu, we were told that there was no more beef meals. Flight attendants were \u201cinternational\u201d, yet did not understand anything in English so it was difficult communicating with them. Check in at departures was the slowest we\u2019ve ever experienced at well. This was the same for domestic flight check ins. Overall I would not recommend this airline to anyone, not even to my worst enemy.",

We did not fill out the special assistance request as it has never been an issue with airlines in the past so thought it would be ok. JAL changed the seating plan on 3 of our flights moving us from the seats we had chosen and on one flight to non adjacent seats. When we contacted the call centre and asked if we could change the seating arrangement and explained our situaton we were told no, they are the allocated seats there is nothing we can do. After going back and forth with the operator I said that we would be unable to fly with the current seating arrangement can they move someone else. Again told no, as they will not move passengers from their seating location eventhough ours had been changed??? Having no alternative I asked for a refund which they stated would take 2 to 3 months to process. Entirely unhappy with the whole situation I sent an email explaining our issues and got a quick reply saying sorry we ask for your understanding but nothing we can do. No offer of alternate flights etc just we changed your seat bad luck.. Lesson learned dont care about their customers, special assistance policy or anything so beware if you are thinking about flying with JAL",

I went so far as to go to the airport to try and get assistance. There were no ticket agents available so I went to the administrative office and was denied help from the manager because he said if he did it for me, he\u2019d have to do it for everybody. He told me to keep calling customer service and wait until someone answers the phone. There is no way to communicate virtually on the website. It was an infuriating experience to say the least!  I never got the help I needed but luckily, my trip was great. Will fly to Japan with an American based  airline next so that I don\u2019t have these issues.",

        "review_text": "We spent some time during the peak season, June and July 2023, in different parts of Asia.  Being members of the oneworld alliance, we were not able to get on our preferred airline because of schedule conflicts.  Despite that, we were able to get tickets from one of the partners - JAL.\n\nFirst time flying JAL embarking from different countries within Asia and between the US, and the conclusion from different routes was that, it was consistently below standards; we all felt like we were in the economy class instead of business class.\n\nReasons for not flying JAL again:\n-the lounge in different parts of the world sucks, consistently (look at the ramen pic below)\n-food on the plane was bad, bland, cold, they went out Wagyu beef all the times\n-the aircraft was dirty, old, had an odor that was irritating\n-if you don't specify the kinds and the amount of food or utensils that you want, you will end up putting your finger on the buzzer many many times.  For instance, I asked for 'some bread', I was then given a kid-sized cold bun with no butter and jam; I asked for water and then I was given water with no ice, if don't ask for napkins or toothpicks, they won't put some on your tray.  The whole process was beyond frustrating and inefficient; it was like begging for food and services.  Other airlines will offer desserts, extra drinks to you without even asking to make sure that you are well fed and hydrated.  You will assume that fruit, salad, and bread are pretty standard.  However, if you don't ask, you get NONE.\n-they don't have a specify time for the last meal before landing, you have to time it yourself or else they will tell you that the pantry has been closed\n-they don't take away your trash even if they see it, I think they only take away your trash once or twice during the flight.  I needed to bag my trash nicely\n-after you order your last meal, they will tell you that it is your last order; very funny\n-they still struggle with English; asking for a cup of decaf tea and was given a decaf coffee and then a cup of tea with lemon\n-was asking for a glass of champagne Drappier and a glass of OPIA, the flight attendant kept clarifying to me they were both different, it was very funny, even that they wanted to put a cap on it\n-was asking for their Japanese white and red wine from Coco Farm, they were available on all my six routes\n-some of my traveling members are not Diamond / Emerald members, even though they knew that we were traveling TOGETHER, they put us in different lounges and groups for departure\n-did not inform us that our check in would be a training session, making us standing at the counter for a long time without apologies; they also forgot to give us back our membership cards after checking in, they had to chase us back while we were in the security area already\n-flight attendants were stiff and not trying to make you feel welcomed and at ease\n-the cabin temperature at night was way too warm to be able to sleep well\n-when they assigned seats, even though they knew that we were traveling TOGETHER, they separated us\n-the seat was uncomfortable and narrower\n\nI was surprised by the positive reviews on YouTube.  The truth is that it was not good at all.",

I had arranged seats where my husband had a window seat and I had the aisle across from him.  Today, June 29 several days bfoe our trip I saw that Japa Airlines changed our seats.  I was not happy.  I called American Express and they were on the phone with Japan Airlines for nearly two hours. I erroneously disconnected the phone. I then called Japan airlines (800-525-3663) and I am still waiting for almost 2 hours.  I understand that if there is a change in configuration of the airplane that they need to change seats.  This was not the case.  I sense that because we are not of Japanese descent JAL felt that it was okay to change our seats.  We had made our reervations 10 months prior.  My husband is a \"wanna be pilot.\" He love looking out the window on take-off and landing. That is why I try to select our seats.  Additionally, we like to sit across from each other and not next to each other.  Patricia Newman",

The aircraft was clean and modern and staff were very accommodating.\n\nReturn flight on 777, 3-3-3 formation however managed to book early and got row 27 so just two seats together. The seats were a little less comfortable however the service was once again exemplary, worth paying a little extra to use this carrier. Especially the 787 using the \u2018Sky wider\u2019 seat layout.",

        "review_text": "We took ANA's flight to Haneda in December 2022, then we took JAL's flight to Narita in April 2023. Both were six-hour flights. The differences we spotted were:\n\n1) Prices:\nJAL's tickets were about 10% cheaper than ANA's at the time of our booking.\n\n2) Seats and entertainment:\n- Legroom was less than ANA's.\n- Seats looked and felt older.\n- Entertainment system looked like it was running on an 1990s OS interface.\n- Movie selection was also less than ANA's.\n- Our retractable remote control had some bits of food on it... probably because the service team wasn't able to wipe down every single item during the short turnaround time.\n- Suggest to invest in newer planes/seats/entertainment systems which are totally touch-screen and high definition. Singapore Airlines had introduced an app that lets you use your own personal devices as remote controls since 2016... this technology was around for over 7 years! Also, no retractable remote controls = less dirty corners = less bacteria.\n\n3) Food:\nANA served us Japanese mixed nuts twice and dessert was H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream. Their soba tasted fresh.\nJAL didn't have pre-meal snacks, and their somen was... a little hardened.\n\n4) Toilets:\nANA's toilets were larger, and we observed the stewardesses checking the toilets almost after every passenger's exit, refreshening it ever so often. They also had a bottle of lavender-scented lotion and fragrance spray in each.\nThe JAL flight we took had none of the above.\n\n5) Stewardesses:\nANA's stewardesses were professional and very hardworking, you could tell that they were always on the move, but could seem a little cold as they were always rushing.\nJAL's stewardesses seemed friendlier. They smiled, greeted and were more patient when asking our kids to choose a toy (by the way JAL's toys beat ANA's cardboard plane) they liked.\n\nANA seemed to be the clear winner here. Hope JAL update their planes!",

Food was as if procured from some roadside eatery. Cabin crew seemed indifferent. I had to remind twice to get a glass of wine. \nTo add insult to injury the cabin crew handed over breakfast in plastic bags to us even before we had struggled to finish our dinner.  The plastic bag contained a STICKY muffin, flavoured yogurt of an average brand some cut fruits. All wasted.\nI assured my wife that food and service should be better in the next sector, Haneda-SFO and indeed it was, as if we were flying a different airline.\n\nIt is unfortunate that some reputed airlines give less than average service and quality of food  on sectors from & to Delhi. Some kind of apartheid??\nInflight entertainment was limited. Cabin crew announcements in English weren't clear.",

Yes, changes happen, we understand.  However, this now required an overnight stay at the Melbourne airport at our expense.  Moreover, our arrival in Tokyo was now timed to arrive 3 hours after our connecting flight departed for Osaka.  JAL had changed the time on the long-haul flight but not the connector.  Because our arrival was now late in the day, we could no longer connect the same day to Osaka so we had to pay for a hotel night at NRT because JAL refused.  They also refused to book a new connecting flight to Osaka so we had to make our own arrangements including expense for the Tokyo to Osaka flight.  For as premium as the long-haul service was, this lack of appropriate response from JAL was quite disappointing.",

        "review_text": "We flew on flight JL42 on the way out to Tokyo and JL43 on the way back to London, and both flights were really amazing! Flight times were between 13-14 hours each way.\n\nSeats and general comfort:\nMe and my partner are not the slimmest of people and sometimes travel on planes/trains etc can feel a bit cramped so we were very pleasantly suprised to find on both flights that even in the economy seats on JAL the seats were really spacious, felt more like a business class sized seating than economy which was great for us!\n\nThe seats were super comfortable, you have plenty of leg room (my partner is tall and could fully stretch out his legs) loads of space for your bags and bits you want while on the plane and even when the person infront reclines you don't really notice any difference in the space around you which is fantastic.\n\nThe head rests are really comfortable and are able to be adjusted in multiple ways to suit everyone.\n\nSeat material again increased the comfort as kept a nice temperature (not too hot or cold etc).\n\nBoth flights the air stewards controlled the lighting and dropped it to night time settings except during take off, landing and when food and drink was being served etc and the lighting subtly transitioned at each point which was nice.\n\nFood and Drink:\nThe food on both flights was wonderful, I personally preferred the food on the flight out there but when I served a dish on the way back that I just couldn't have eaten (lots of fish) they very kindly swapped it out for a vegatarian dish they had spare.\n\nFlight out to Tokyo:\nDinner: we both opted for the Chicken cooked in Japanese radish sauce with rice rather than the beef dish they offered, this came with some small dishes on the side; soba noodles, smoked salmon cream cheese & dried tomatoes, vinegared cucumber & wakame sea plant, bread and butter, fresh salad, shortbread, ice cream. It was all really lovely but the smoked salmon side was especially good.\nSnack: Red bean bun, rice cracker snack pack\nBreakfast: omelette with tomato ragout, hash browns & turkey sausage, yogurt, fresh fruits, croissant\nDrinks throughout: Generally whatever drinks you wanted, plenty of choice of soft drinks, a few alcoholic options and then several opportunities for hot drinks. \n\nFlight back from Tokyo:\nI opted for the grilled chicken cacciatore with mushrooms and pasta\nMy partner opted for the hamburger steak in ginger with corn & mustard rice.\nBoth of which were nice but not quite as nice as the flight out.\nThe sides were: sansho pepper kinpira with lotus root & fried tofu, steamed chicken & zucchini with tahini sauce, salad of quinoa, mochi mugi barley &\nfermented vegetable, fresh salad with dressing, ice cream\nSnack: rice cracker snack pack, miso soup (this was really special, just what I needed)\nLunch:\nchewing Tuna, Clam & Millet Short Pasta in a Japanese Ginger Sauce (this was the one I just couldn't eat - it was far too fishy for me but the air hostess promptly found me an alternative of a mushroom curry which was delightful and very accommodating)\nOrange Jelly with Nata de Coco (which was very tasty_\nDrinks throughout: Generally whatever drinks you wanted, plenty of choice of soft drinks, a few alcoholic options and then several opportunities for hot drinks. \n\nCleanliness and Bathrooms\nThe planes were both really clean but I have to mention how clean and generally excellent the toilets were on the flight back to London!\nIt had the most spacious airplane toilet room I have ever seen, it was delightful, it had little luxuries like deodorant/freshener spray, face towels, and was decorated lovely.\n\nEntertainment:\nPlenty of films, shows, music and other bits to keep you entertained, I think I watched about 6 films in total, 2 on the way out and 4 on the way back...  but there were plenty more I could have watched, I liked being able to make a music playlist also from the songs they have available and given there were so many chilled piano and nature sounding songs I was able to create a bit of a sleep playlist.... was exactly what I needed.\n\nCustomer service:\nSo friendly, so accommodating, really brilliant service on both flights and in the airports.\n\nAt all points where turbulance might be encountered they gave fair warning as an announcement and given my partner is a nervous flyer especially with turbulence it made it easier for him to feel reassured, as he said - two of the best flights he has taken, both were so smooth, with minimal turbulence really even given the warnings.... just brilliant!\n\nBaggage came through quickly at both airports and seemed to have been handled with care.\n\nFlight back arrived about 1 hour earlier than I expected based on JAL original time on app, winning!\n\nThe views both landing into Tokyo and especially taking off from Tokyo with Mount Fuji in the background - incredible!",

At one stage they said just put her in the seat asleep and strap the belt on. The belt did not fit and she fell down and banged her head. We asked if we could trade our 2 premium economy seats for 1 bassinet seat in any class (economy, premium, business). They refused to do this even though there were available seats as they said it would disrupt the passengers who paid extra for these front row seats (none of them had kids). It was very ironic given we paid a lot more for a premium economy seat that we could not use. I wrote a few letters of complaint to their complaints department. It has been 3 months and quite a few follow ups and I have not had one singe reply",

        "review_text": "After a long awaited time, my sister and I finally can and decided to meet in Japan for our dream trip.  I booked my flights with JAL, and I'm so excited!  I sent my itinerary to my sister so she can match my flights to meet at the airports in Japan.  It was really hard to sync up together to book our flights due to the time difference between us.  We finally booked everything and now my sister realized my return flight is departing from 2 different airports in Japan.  My return flight is from Osaka ITM to Haneda then from Haneda to Narita before flying back to Vancouver.  Why would I book a flight that makes me fly to Haneda and then have to go to Narita before flying home to Vancouver.  From Haneda to Narita I would have to transit there.  So I checked and there's another flight 20 mins later at 14:50 to fly from Osaka ITM to Narita and then from Narita to Vancouver.  So I called fully willing to pay a penalty or book another flight just from Osaka to Narita but the agent that I spoke to on the phone said I can't rebook not even with a penalty fee and I could not just book another connecting flight because if I don't follow my flight plan the rest of my flights will be cancelled.  This just doesn't make sense.  Also, the agent that I spoke with yelled at me and told me that  it was their policy and no one can do anything about it.  When I asked to speak to a manager they declined.  They said no manager can help me either and the only option I have is to forfeit my ticket that I paid over $1600 for and to rebook and pay another $1600 or book a flight which is $2600 from Haneda to Vancouver.  This blows my mind when I read other reviews online there's many reviews that this happens to many people and it's a complete money grab.  I don't align with Japan Airlines values, what a disgrace to Japan.  Japan is known for being courteous and kind and the service I received today is the complete opposite of that.  I'm fully willing to pay a penalty since it's my fault, or buy a connecting ticket to replace my mistake but the ridged \"policy\" (money grab) is completely disgusting.  If you are thinking about booking with Japan Airlines, DON'T!!!!",

I didn\u2019t manage to thank Arito-mi (if I got her name correctly). I was incredibly in distress, worrying that I will have to rebook my tickets and on top of the extra costs, worrying that next available flight would be the next day (because i checked online) - I live in Singapore and I do have to say that in our country, every thing is all about money and there is barely any empathy or \u2018go for the extra mile for your customers\u2019. Arito-mi was so very kind and instead of how usually customer service would \u2018brush you off\u2019, she calmly told us to hold on and had us seated aside while she checked what she could do for us to catch the next flight. To my surprise, instead of a SGD600 that I supposedly had to pay for a one way ticket back. We only had to pay less than SGD50 per person and the best part, it is a flight in next 3 hours. Later was handled by Sagya who handled our baggage check-in. I suppose she noticed my partner and I were seated apart, she made a call and shared to us that she had requested for seat reallocation so we could be seated together during the flight.\n\nI am incredibly touched by the customer service and the genuine initiative from both of them. From a very distressing situation over a mistake that is obviously of my own. Both Arito-mi and Sagya has warmed my heart after a sobbing time finding out I missed my flight. I am so glad that I left Japan in a good note.\n\nThank you to both of them and I must say they are a great asset to JAL. All the best and take care! I hope to come back to Japan soon!",

My journey required a change of airport from Narita to Haneda in a 4 hour layover.  My online check in was denied using JAL app and website, so I show up on 11/30 to catch my flight departing at 11:55pm in Hanoi.  I was 2.5 hours early before departure which was plenty of time to check in, at the ticket counter, the attendant said I need to provide them with the ticket number in order to issue a boarding pass.  I show them my booking information on my phone in JAL portal and they said it is not enough and they must have the ticket number.  I told them the ticket was issued via a reward redemption with AA.  They said they couldn't help me and I need to contact AA to get more information.  I got on the AA chat immediately and was able to obtain the ticket number, I immediately provided the ticket number to the counter attendant, they were able to locate the flights but only could print the boarding pass from Hanoi to Narita, and said the second boarding pass will have to be issued in Haneda airport for departure to DFW, when I told them that I might not have enough time because the layover is 4 hours, they let me carry the carryon (even though 2 kg over the limit) rather than have it checked.  I do find that very nice of them for allowing me to carry on. \n \nHowever, the fact that they can't find my reservation unless I give them the ticket number is odd.  How can an airline not have my name or passport number to pull up the ticket information/reservations?   If AA chat was nonresponsive, I could have missed my flights.  \n\nI would say that the meals on both flights were very nice.  I chose the asian meals on both flights.  Flight attendants were all very attentive and courteous.  \n\nJAL needs to improve their check in process!!!  Although I did arrive on time and got on the connecting flight in Haneda airport, the delay in getting the boarding pass and the check in process could be improved.   I am giving 5 of out 10 stars due to the check in issue.",

        "review_text": "I was looking forward to a trip to Japan for myself and my wife in November and went with JAL because they had a great reputation and I didn't want any hassles or problems on our 10th wedding anniversary.  I booked our flights in late May for a November visit and received an email confirmation.  I wanted to double check our seats in August and it's a good thing I did as there was no record of our booking despite a confirmation email and code!!  I contacted a JAL rep who said he could book the flight, but that we would have to pay for the flight again and get refunded later.  As the rest of our trip, including accommodation and trains were already booked, I reluctantly went along with this.  I later received a call  from the same rep who said he would get us upgraded seats on the outbound and inbound flights, but would have to pay for the upgrades upfront and that they would be refunded later.  At this point I was pretty suspicious and checked out the name of the rep, who was in fact, a JAL employee.  Long story short, we never received the upgraded seats!  The outbound upgrades were never recorded and the inbound upgrades were cancelled because the video monitors for both seats were not working.  Icing on the cake was that we sat under a vent on the inbound flight and were absolutely freezing for 10 hours.  We are still dealing with a cold/flu one week after returning.  \n\nAfter all this, we were told it would be \"one to two billing cycles\"  (i.e. one to two months) before our refund would appear on my credit card.  \n\nJapan was beautiful, but flying with JAL was an absolute nightmare with a lot of broken promises.  As of this date, I am still out $3600.  \n\nDo yourself a favor and go with any airline other than JAL.",

The only option they say is to pay a cancellation fee of $300 an error that was not my fault as I imputed my information to purchase a ticket and my passport details.  So, I have to pay a fee for their error and now I can't rebook at that price.  My option now is to pay $2500 with another airline.  I will NEVER recommend Japan Airlines and certainly will NEVER travel with them.  I work in the airline industry and was really disappointed in the Lack of service and could not care less attitude they gave me.  According to them it was my fault.",

We were starving when we got to Tokyo! \nOn the return flight we made sure we weren't treated as vegans again and the food was a little better, but by no means equivalent in volume and variety as the standard food package.

We had the weird experience of one of us (as a couple traveling together) being almost completely ignored during the main meal service. The service started at 8:30 p.m., and almost 30 minutes elapsed between the warm towel and the appetizer, and another 30 minutes between that and the salad.  After that, others were served entrees throughout the cabin, including my spouse, but i was left waiting.  At 10:30 p.m., I still had not been served.  I used the call button to ask what was happening, but no one ever came.  In frustration I cleared my own dishes and took them to the galley, where there were 5 flight attendants gathered, clearing dishes.  They were shocked to see me.  I told them it was too late to eat and I wanted to go to sleep.  After that, 2 different flight attendants came to my seat and offered apologies and other foods, but there was never an explanation as to what had happened, if the entree was not available or if the oven was broken or whatever.  Neither FA was the initial flight attendant who had introduced herself to me at the beginning of the flight - she seemed to have disappeared.  My take is that it was a  mistake and I was just ignored or forgotten, but no one acknowledged that.  I notice that some of the flight attendants are now not Japanese, and I wondered if someone was in training or inexperienced or just not working up to par.  It was atypical of our experience with JAL and quite strange.",

        "review_text": "Just flew Japan Airlines from Australia to Europe via Tokyo. Booked Premium Economy seats almost a year in advance - and chose Japan Airlines specifically to secure Premium Economy seats for the long flight. Two weeks before departure, Japan Airlines phoned to advise that the aircraft had been changed and Premium Economy class was no longer available. Options were to make an already long journey longer by adding another stop in Europe in order to fly in Premium Economy or to downgrade to Economy. All arrangements for the trip had obviously been made by this time and we couldn't cancel or change carrier, so we reluctantly had to accept the downgrade. Again, booked 11 months in advance, they advised just 2 weeks from departure, and even had the nerve to suggest that we cancel our tickets outright and re-book, despite the ticket prices being far higher given that it was so close to the departure date.\n\nWe were told we would need to wait until the trip had been completed before we could request a refund. We were also told that the refund amount couldn't be confirmed until after the trip. We were provided with no receipts or paperwork related to the new ticket purchase, and as numerous reviewers already note, the website is useless for trying to manage your own booking.\n\nWe put in cash bids for upgrades to business on our return flight, having endured the long haul economy on the way over and dreading the return, but bids on both legs of the trip were rejected. Would have been nice if there had been a red flag on our booking to say that JAL had stuffed us around at the last minute and perhaps accepting our bids would go some way towards compensating - we weren't asking for free upgrades.\n\nWe get back from the trip after a very long journey in economy class and contact Japan Airlines to arrange the refund as we had been advised then the tickets were downgraded by the JAL phone operator. In short, Japan Airlines has now advised it will not refund any amount, as the economy fare that they booked in downgrading us was the highest cost / fully flexible fare that equated to the cost of the Premium Economy tickets. This was not communicated to us at the time of the downgrade, and we certainly wouldn't have agreed if we had known that the phone operator had discretion in which booking class the downgraded ticket was allocated - how dare you spend our money without permission?\n\nI spent ages on the phone talking with different people, who all advised that there will be no refund and there is no recourse. So we have paid extra for Premium Economy class, paid in full well in advance of our travel dates, to sit in economy, through no fault of our own and with this change being made two weeks before our departure.\n\nThis is our money that has been taken under false pretenses! We paid for something we didn't receive. Japan Airlines couldn't care less and has offered nothing. I can't go back in time to check the difference in economy and premium economy classes when I booked, but searching now for a similar time next year shows that premium economy is more than double the price of economy.\n\nWe would have expected a refund of maybe ~$1,000-1,200 pp, so $2-2,400 in total! This is completely unacceptable and feels like theft.\n\nInsurance doesn't cover it, because it's the airline's responsibility. Currently checking with my bank if it can help through the lens of products/services paid for and not received. We'll also check with ACCC around consumer guarantees relevant to flights offered by international companies that depart from Australia, but it doesn't look good.\n\nFor what it's worth, the on board experience is good but I'll never fly with them again.",

Free snacks napkins as well wet wipes, now of course I went to the bathroom and it\u2019s clean speaking of cleanliness seats were a bit exposed but that\u2019s fine the seats still comfortable, the in flight entertainment has a lot of movies and 5 games, 3 hours later the meal was served I got some kind of salmon porridge, a salad, strawberry yogurt, fruits and another salad, then flight attendant offered me the same variety of drinks but I choose orange juice this time but guess what? Silverware in economy, it\u2019s supposed to be plastic but the airline was very nice and gave me Silverware, then I enjoyed the meal after all it\u2019s delicious and tasty, then I watched some movies in the remaining time, then guess what? landed early overall I would recommend this airline since the meal is good, plenty of legroom, great seats and friendly service",

I'm not able to see or manage my bookings. It's like they're stuck on the 90s. The worst air company website I've seen in my life, you can't do anything there except to buy tickets I suppose. \n\nIf you have any problem with your booking, don't expect to be able to solve it through the website. It's useless. \n\nWant a refund? You'll get it. But take your chair and wait for a good 2-3 months for the money to be back in your account. Don't have money to buy replacement tickets? That's your problem I suppose.\n\nAll in all, I haven't even started my trip to Japan and Japan Airlines has managed to make everything stressful and troublesome. Thanks Japan Airlines!",

In Finland the flight got cancelled, and we sat there waiting for six hours before we got the final call about the flight being cancelled. They mainly gave the messages in Japanese, and didn\u2019t seem to care too much about notifying the other passengers in English. They also gave snacks and drinks to everyone else waiting but not to us (probably because we were not Japanese). Our trip was delayed two days, but they gave us accommodation and 20euros for food those days. On the plane they could also have been better at bringing drinks during a 14 hour flight, in this time we only got offered drinks about two times other than when we got food. Other airlines are a lot better at this.\nThe worst part of this whole case is the requesting of compensation. Since we are under the passengers rights regulated by EC261/04 we are eligible for compensation for this two days delay. You cannot reach them by email, you have to call. They will make you wait for hours(!!!) before they pick up the phone. And their phone line is terrible so you can\u2019t even hear what they say, this combined with poorly English makes this whole situation quite frustrating. It\u2019s doesn\u2019t even seem like they know the rules so they keep putting you on hold, declining our rights or avoid giving answers. I\u2019ve never experienced this poor service. It\u2019s probably a good airline when everything\u2019s goes according to plan and when you don\u2019t have to reach them though.",

My family has been faithfully flying JAL since the late 80's and have ALWAYS used JAL for trips to Japan to see family. In the future this will not be the case. We intend to fly on one of their competitors that also offer non stop flights and far more reasonable pricing and that does not charge exorbitant  prices for a change in  flight plans. The cost quoted to me to change the FIRST LEG of my round trip airfare is more than the original round trip airfare. This makes no sense, the flight I wanted to change to has many empty seats and will most likely have empty seats when it departs. JAL needs to examine the level of service it is providing. It would be cheaper for me to walk away from my original booking and book a new round trip travel.  Additionally my daughter and wife recently traveled to Japan and the food they were served on that flight was abysmal. JAL had been riding on old positive reviews and ratings from its customers. The JAL of today is NOT the JAL of previous times!!\n\nAnd one other thing, the website and the App are both absolutely abysmal. Neither of them perform well and the website does not allow you to search fir a round trip airfare now.",

This means you will be separated from the rest of the family on the plane and have to sit alone with the baby. Call centres or service counter refused to let my mother sit next to me to help me with the baby. I had two empty bassinet seats next to me and still they refused to let my mother sit next to me to help me. Also for some bizarre reason I was not able to book the bassinet seats when I purchased the tickets so had to rely on call centre and service counter. Do not trust the message on their website that says priority will be given to passenger with baby. They literally mean \"passenger\" in the singular form.",

But they did not give us seats  next to each other. They sell the window seats for extra money. So only 2 people can sit together, as result dad was sitting 6 rows behind the rest of the family and they were not willing to change it because window seats are paid. Tried to change it upfront by phone, by the seat reservation system, in the airport and onboard. No luck Very sad, daughter was crying for an hour... We've seen other families being spread over the economy class as well, so we were not the only ones. So I would not recommend flying with them if you expect the free seats from 1 booking/family to always end up next to each other.",

Firstly I want to stress that the cabin staff are absolutely brilliant and although their English is average they do their very best to communicate with you. The 7 seats across each row in business is in my opinion too many. The seats are only slightly larger than premium economy and as a flat bed turning from side to side is difficult. Their pricing makes them an ideal choice for value seekers but if you are looking for a \u201ctrue\u201d business class experience then perhaps Singapore would be far better if a lot more expensive. The food on the flights was good especially the steak but the selection was only average. Lastly the entertainment available to English speaking customers is very poor and well below that of comparable airlines. I would recommend them for value and customer service but lacking in the refinements of some of their competitors.",

Also, when it comes to style, privacy and ergonomics, JAL seats in First falling behind the times when compared to newer First class seats with other airlines (however JAL A350 have newer seats).\n* TV monitors on board are not of highest resolution (behind when it comes to its competitors).\n* Bathrooms are nothing special and fall behind competitor First class offerings.\n\nOverall great experience.

Not only did they rebook us without question, our bags arrived as normal in Tokyo and they even paid for our transportation into the city and a nice hotel room.

Even in economy, the flight crew could not do enough for you, exceptionally polite and respectful, and the kind of service normally reserved for business and first class.\n\nThe in-flight meal was delicious, hearty and sizeably larger than most other economy sized meals on other airlines. \n\nSeat configuration on the 787 and 767 were 2-4-2 which I also prefer as it does feel there is more legroom and individual space compared to most other major airlines. \n\nAll in all, 2 long gruelling flights were made much easier and comfortable due to JAL's excellence. In my opinion, unrivaled in economy from all other major airlines in Europe, Middle East and USA. \n\nThank you JAL.",

The seats are good; the television does not really work and is very glitchy. Very few movies (relative to something like United) and movies have poor prints and keep stopping or being erratic. But the worst part is the cabin service. While the cabin attendants are very polite, they are politely ineffective. A meal service takes 3-4 hours and in a 8-9 hour flight, lights are barely dimmed and if so, then hardly so for 1 hour or so. I buy business class tickets mainly for the flat bed and ability to sleep through a red eye flight but JAL makes that impossible. I would not recommend it to anyone.",

My wife, Judy Ng believes it is Michelin Star fine dining quality,  The effort and planning of the Food shows Excellent work by the chefs and staff.   Secondly,   I would like to commend the Stewardess Staff on both Flight JAL Flight 712 and JAL Flight 58 on June 12, 2024 on Business Class.   They did such a wonderful job, I wrote their names down:  first names were Kondo and Handa on Flight 712 Business Class, and Ms Aoki and Ms Seto on Flight 58 Business class  ,  both on June 12th.   I believe me and my wife spoke to each Stewardess and were overjoyed with their kindness and service.   On Flight 712, we spoke to the Manager of the Crew I believe.  Thirdly,  I'd like to commend the JAL organization for their ability to switch my wifes non-window seat to an \"locked\"  Window seat on Business, and they were able to move me so that we were togeather.    This request Started in Singapore JAL Check In ( I have a photo of both the ticket agent lady, and her Manager) who took the matter and contacted Narita Airport Staff to execute the Seat Change.   What FANTASTIC coordination and Service !!   Thank you !!  We were met at the gate by JAL Staff person and she had a sign for  Ms Judy Ng ( Wife) and escorted to the transfer desk/Sekura First class lounge for re-ticketing.   Every thing was so quickly &\nprofessionally done.  What a overall professional organization and Staff.   Thank you.    Judyhippofant@yahoo.com and RichJohnLee@yahoo.com",

        "review_text": "Comparison of the first class services of Japan Airlines (JAL) and All Nippon Airways (ANA):\n\n---\n\nService\n\nIn terms of service, Japan Airlines (JAL) clearly has the upper hand. JAL's cabin crew is renowned for their friendliness, professionalism, and meticulous attention to detail. Whether addressing passenger needs or handling unexpected situations, JAL staff respond quickly and gracefully, making passengers feel warmly welcomed. While ANA's service is also excellent, it falls slightly short in the finer details compared to JAL.\n\nFood\n\nJAL also excels in the food department. The first-class meals on JAL are designed by Michelin-starred chefs, offering a diverse and delicious selection, especially in Japanese cuisine. The ingredients are fresh, and the presentation is exquisite, reflecting the chef's dedication in every dish. Although ANA's food is also good, it is somewhat less impressive in terms of taste and refinement compared to JAL.\n\nHardware Facilities\n\nWhen it comes to hardware facilities, ANA takes the lead. ANA's first-class seats are more spacious and comfortable, providing better privacy and entertainment options. The seat design is more modern and comes with a more advanced entertainment system and seat control features. However, it is worth noting that JAL is continually improving its hardware facilities. Although their latest first-class equipment has not been widely implemented yet, it is expected to catch up with or even surpass ANA in the future.\n\n Amenity Kits, Pajamas, and Slippers\n\nIn terms of amenity kits, pajamas, and slippers, ANA is more thoughtful. ANA provides high-quality skincare products and comfortable pajamas in their amenity kits, and the slippers are designed with great care, ensuring passengers feel more comfortable and relaxed during long flights. In comparison, while JAL's amenity kits are also quite good, they are slightly less impressive in terms of detail and material quality.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, JAL outperforms in service and food, offering passengers a superior experience. On the other hand, ANA excels in hardware facilities and amenity kits, focusing more on passenger comfort. If you prioritize in-flight service and food quality, JAL is a great choice; if you value seat comfort and privacy more, ANA would be the better option. Ultimately, the choice between the two airlines depends on personal preferences and needs.",

One airport has a same day check in, while the other is 4 hours before only, leaving me and my family stranded in the airport waiting to check in with over 115 degrees outside in Delhi airport where there are no restaurants before security. They didn't even have a specific check in counter and we had to deal with the unhelpful information desk. Because of their lack of communication, my family has now been put in a difficult situation 2 times on this one trip. I was told they have amazing service, but only if you know how to find information hidden away on their website. Good luck if you travel with them.",

What happens is you have couples taking both aisle seat in the centre arrangements and abuse the system.  They put in in the J seat with is the front seating.  The problem is that you share both tray an TV screen.  Instead of independently living the arm rest you could only lift one wat between two. The person next to me continually ripped open with such force. I could not sleep or get comfortable.  Not only that, the seat I was assigned to was not comfortable.  I saw at least four hours to go and I contemplated sitting on the floor.  Eventually I sat on the pillow and blanket to make it less stressful and relieve the pain from sitting.  Not only that they were happy to take other customers meal tray and refused to take mine. Anyway they blamed the travel agent and ignores the one world alliance sapphire membership.  Thus couples booked both aisle seats and paid for two seat and got three in return while I booked a seat which was nothing more than economy and paid premium prices.",

        "review_text": "First, my wife and I tried to call JAL on the phone the day before travelling. They were useless on the phone. They could not upgrade us over the phone like every other airline could. Then they couldn\u2019t even seat us together via either the crappy app or on the phone.\nNext, when checking in at the airport after several failed attempts via phone we were able to upgrade. They told us the price would be 30,000 Yen each and we agreed. Then when they took us to another counter to pay they said the price is 40,000 Yen each. We told them the first check in ppl told us the 30k but they didn\u2019t have a clue and we just paid the 40k. So already feeling ripped off. \nNext the lounge situation. What a joke. If I had checked in on the app I was able to purchase entry to the Sakura lounge for us both and was happy to pay. But then guess what ? If you pay to upgrade your seat you are NOT ALLOWED to even pay to get into the lounge. Seriously? Wow. \nNext, I\u2019m disabled and had registered for mobility assistance. I can\u2019t walk far or stand for long so I need a wheelchair to the gate. I have been travelling all over the world registering as needing mobility assistance and never was asked why. Until today. The counter assistant asked me why I needed the wheelchair and if I was on medication\u2026 just wow. No other airline or country has ever asked these things. So right after explaining that she went back behind the counter said something to her coworker (the JAL employees all seem to work one job in pairs for some unknown reason)  and they literally laughed out loud at whatever she said. Now I can only assume that was at my expense. So so rude, so much for Japanese hospitality. \nNext, it takes two people to take us through security and customs, one to push the wheelchair and one to do nothing but supervise the whole thing. Very weird. So they say we cannot access any lounge and leave us our gate. As soon as they leave us, my wife goes to an information desk and they direct us straight to one of the lounges where we were able to pay and access. Again, seriously?? What a joke of customer service.",

Was very nice to have someone guide me through the menu, JAL customer service is aces. As for the price, a bit on the high side at $30. A comparable paid meal on ANA is only \u00a52500, or just under $17 USD at today's rates. \n\nImpossible to choose between JAL and ANA.

        "review_text": "We were so excited about our trip to Japan that we decided to splurge and fly JAL instead of the cheaper options. I ended up paying $2k for a round trip flight, more than I\u2019ve paid for any other international flight. I was told the experience was great and it was worth the price, but that was not the case.\n\nThe person I\u2019m flying with has status on Alaska Air and was able to choose seats. When I booked the flight, I wasn\u2019t given the option to choose seats. Fast forward to trying to check-in and I STILL didn\u2019t have a seat assigned \u2014 for an international flight that I spent $2k on! The person working at the counter was able to help me pick a non-middle seat but the experience was still stressful. Also, trying to find your reservation on their app is a nightmare. On my return flight I was never able to access it.\n\nI am a vegetarian option and picked this as a special meal option. The meals they served leaned vegan. I basically got mushrooms and rice on my way there (x2 meals), and some vegetarian stew and rice (x2 meals) on the way home, which I didn\u2019t even finish. The person I was flying with got margherita pizza for his 2nd meal and ice cream on the way there \u2014 which are both vegetarian and much better options than what I was served. I love airplane food and it\u2019s usually my favorite part of the flight. All the meals and snacks I had on JAL were disappointing.\n\nI tried to sleep on the way home since it was essentially an overnight flight but kept getting woken up by the flight attendants. This was also odd to me.\n\nLastly, the plane felt old and nothing special. I was hoping to be wowed here as well as I have been with other airlines.\n\nI will never be flying JAL again and would never recommend it. What a bummer.",

        "type_of_route": "North Asia",
        "review_text": "I flew from Hong Kong to Osaka, taking Cathay Pacific from HK to Bangkok and then connecting to Japan Airlines JL728 from Bangkok to Osaka (Kansai).  After arriving at my hotel (Hilton Osaka) in Osaka, I discovered that one of the 4 wheels on my suitcase had been damaged such that it would not roll in certain directions, having been rammed in towards the suitcase and scraping the bottom of the suitcase when rolled.  I initially contacted Cathay since my luggage tag was issued by Cathay but they explained that airline rules dictate the last carrier in connecting flights is responsible for luggage.  I then contacted Japan Airlines and was initially told that any damage had to be reported at the airport before I left the arrivals area or JAL would not be responsible.  I reasoned with JAL that as Kansai airport provided luggage carts, I simply took my suitcase off the luggage carousel and put it on a luggage cart and never had to wheel it around until I arrived at my hotel.  Initially JAL staff stuck to their policy but thanks to some assistance in Japanese from the staff at Hilton Osaka (highly recommend!) and my pointing out that JAL's own website and the conditions of carriage shown on their website only indicate damage has to be reported to a JAL office within 7 days, JAL referred the matter to a manager and I was generously offered a replacement suitcase as a special favour.  In fact, when  staff initially contacted me and offered a replacement suitcase that was a zippered suitcase and I indicated my damaged suitcase was a hard frame suitcase and I would prefer that, staff actually worked hard to find me two other options that were hard frame suitcases to see if they suited my needs better. \n\nI had hoped JAL could simply fix the damaged wheel on my suitcase but JAL explained that repairs would take months in their normal procedures and so was not practical (Hilton Osaka confirmed the same for me by calling local luggage repair companies).  JAL also arranged to have my damaged suitcase sent back to them so that they could have parts of it recycled rather than simply thrown away by me, a very green step.  \n\nIt started as a frustrating run in with inflexible and what to me seemed like unreasonable policy, but it ended on a very kind and generous note with JAL going above and beyond to provide me with a usable replacement suitcase in a very quick timeframe. \n\nAs for the flight itself, I had a couple of hours connection time and used the JAL Sakura lounge at Kansai.  The lounge is quite large with lots of seating areas and a dining area where largely food is ordered from staff from the displayed menu and then prepared by staff and placed on a tray to be taken away by the guest.  The menu items look simple but the quality of the food is always very good and delicious. \n\nThe flight was delayed about 50 minutes due to the incoming flight being late due to bad weather.  The flight is an overnight flight scheduled to depart 12:55 am and arrive at 8:10 am.  Unfortunately, this overnight flight has always been operated with a B787-800 in a 2X2X2 configuration in business class with the Shell Flat Neo seat, an angled flat seat rather than a fully horizontal flat seat like the Sky Suite seat on other JAL long haul flights.  I had an aisle seat but as the cabin appeared to be about 1/3 empty, was fortunate to have no one sit at the window seat beside me and so could shift over to the window seat for more privacy when sleeping.  \n\nPrior to take off, breakfast orders are taken.  After take off, there is a quick service of a snack but most passengers opted to immediately go to sleep.  About 2 hours before arrival, breakfast is served.  Passengers have the option to skip breakfast and not to be woken up by the flight attendants but I think that is fairly useless as the lights are turned up and there is noise anyway from breakfast service to other passengers.  Therefore overall for an overnight flight, it is difficult to get much good sleep on this flight, particularly due to the angled flat seat rather than a fully flat bed seat.  \n\nNevertheless, as always with Japan Airlines, the service onboard is superb and the food is very good.  The toilets are always clean because the cabin attendants constantly clean and then neatly fold the toilet paper tip into a triangle.  This is a good solid overnight flight and a good use of time.  But it is not an ideal flight to sleep on due to the older angled flat seats and the configuration that requires the window seat passenger to step over the aisle passenger for access.",

Premium economy allows you access to the Sakura lounge at Haneda - take advantage; it's spacious, clean and supplied with multiple food and beverages.\nThe flight, on an Airbus 350, was full so nice that Premium Economy gave you access to a spacious dedicated bathroom, dedicated except when the attendants were serving beverages and food in economy. Bathroom even has a bidet seat.\nCheck-in went smoothly once you realized that you get your baggage tag from a kiosk before going to the dedicated Premium Economy line. \nSeats reclined within a shell so they do not lean into the space behind (or in front of) you. Motorized recline and leg rest controls, with a foot rest. Spacious unless you have a lot of things in the foot well.\nEntertainment system was efficient, but I found the selections a bit limited as I am current on most movies and am not Japanese and so do not follow their TV series. Ended up listening to soft music to sleep to. Airline provides noise-cancelling on-the-ear headphones which did a fair job of masking plane noises.\nMeals were similar to what I would expect in Economy, although you were able to request small servings of instant ramen noodles and they handed out steamed buns (red bean filling?) during the flight.\nFlight attendants came by often and were very pleasant.\nAs I was able to pay with Alaska Airlines miles, at a very good rate, this flight was a great value (thanks point.me), based on a suggested rate in a review of this flight segment by someone else.",

If they are asleep, it would be better not to wake them up to ask them if they want a drink or to eat. Excessive disturbance of passengers can be very stressful as sometimes what passengers need is a good rest during a long haul flight. Please train your staff better.",

We ended up having to spend an extra $300 (USD) to stay the night in Tokyo. When asked if we could get vouchers or even an upgraded seat they said the delay was \u201cnot their fault\u201d and therefore not their responsibility to reimburse us even though it was their fault. The attendant originally stated the delay was due to weather, but when we corrected her she checked the information and confirmed it was not due to weather but still denied it was their fault. Overall, really poor customer service and will likely not fly with them again.",

        "type_of_route": "Southeast Asia",
        "review_text": "I connected from Narita to Haneda airport at Tokyo to take my ovenight flight to Bangkok on Japan Airlines JL33.  Transfer from Narita to Haneda was easy on the limousine bus with frequent departures.  However, it took a bit longer than scheduled due to late afternoon traffic.\n \nOnce I arrived at Haneda, check in was quick using the First Class check in and I was quickly into the superb Japan Airlines First Class Lounge at Haneda based on my OneWorld Emerald Status.  The lounge is very spacious with a very large dining area on the main floor with a side seating area, and then upstairs there is a salon bar area serving drinks including the previously hard to obtain Suntory Yamazaki 12 yr premium whiskey.  There is also a separate area upstairs with several massage chairs that offer pre-set massage programs lasting about 10 or 15 minutes each.  The lounge is mainly set for ordering using the QR code on your table, with a few self serve items such as coffee and cold drinks, buns, rice and the trademark JAL curry, and several canapes. The food is beautifully presented and delicious and definitely fine restaurant worthy.  I enjoyed a pork filet with pepper paprika sauce and phyllo wrapped scallop with sea asparagus.  Of course, I did not pass on ordering sushi made to order by the sushi chefs.  If you have access to the Haneda First Class lounge, you will want to go to the airport early to enjoy its elegant ambiance and superb dining. \n \nMy overnight flight to Bangkok was operated with a B787-9 fitted with the Sky Suite III seat in a 1X2X1 configuration.  The seat is fairly comfortable but there is not much storage around the seat for your things and the seat is fairly narrow in flat bed position.  As it was an overnight flight, most people opted to sleep as soon as the flight reached cruising altitude.  If you opt to be served breakfast, you will be woken around 2 hours before arrival for breakfast.  Western breakfast is not a strength for JAL so I opted for the more filling Japanese breakfast which came with a bento box with 5 sections with fruit, pickles and various different small bites and then a main of flounder with vegetable sauce and rice.   As usual, it was beautifully presented and delicious.  \n\nThe flight landed on time at 5:05 am,  Bangkok Suvarnabhumi airport has a sprawling terminal so it is a fairly long walk to immigration.  Due to the early arrival, only one immigration desk was opened for business class passengers and there was a fairly long line up of maybe 20 people by the time I got there.  Fortunately shortly afterward authorities opened up a counter for elderly and those with children and I and a few others in the business class  line were ushered over to the new counter since there was no one there.  I was at the luggage carousel by 5:40 am, out into the arrivals hall by around 5:50 am and quickly into a car to my hotel soon after that.  \n\nAs always, JAL provided excellent service and delicious food on the flight.  It is definitely one of my favourite airlines to fly with and I would always recommend it to friends.",

        "review_text": "I flew JAL from Vancouver to Tokyo Narita.  Japan Airlines does not have its own lounge in Vancouver and uses the Plaza Premium lounge.  That lounge is under renovation so Plaza Premium currently uses a temporary space, just an open area that is cordoned off.  The temporary lounge is very bare basics, offering simple food and drinks served on paper plates and using disposable wood cutlery.  As Plaza Premium is also a pay to use lounge, the space can get fairly crowded.  Just lining up to get in took a while as the person in front of me was trying to pay to get in using a discount that is only available on the app. \n\nThe flight is operated with a B767, an older plane.  Business class has the Sky Suite II seats where the window seat alternate with being right next to the window with a counter next to the aisle on the even numbered rows or having a counter next to the window with the seat being right next to the aisle instead on the odd numbered rows. The cabin is configured 1X2X1 with all seats having direct aisle access but with the even numbered row window seats having greater privacy with a counter between the seat and the aisle.  I find the Sky Suite II seats to be quite narrow at the shoulder when reclined to flat bed position because the armrest does not lower down, and much prefer the original Sky Suite I seats which are wider at the shoulder in bed position and has greater privacy due to its layout. \n\nOlder plane and less desirable seat notwithanding, JAL flights are always a pleasure because the food and the service are consistently excellent.  Every flight seems almost like a constant competition between passengers and the cabin attendants as to whether the next passenger can get to the toilet first or the cabin attendant will get there first to clean up the toilet for the next passenger's use!  I have been on 10 hour flights with JAL where there was never a time I went to the toilet without finding the cabin attendant had already tidy up the toilet and folded the toilet paper into a neat triangle point.  \n\nI usually opt for the Japanese meal since they are always very filling, delicious and beautifully presented.  This flight I opted for the Western beef offering for a change - a starter plate of grilled chicken, prosciutto and salad, and a main of beef tenderloin with stroganoff sauce and pumpkin and pine nut puree.  The meal was very good as usual but I confess I miss the beautiful presentation that the Japanese meal would have had.  Dessert was chocolate fudge cake which was fine, but I always thought Japanese chocolate desserts tended to be on the light side and lacked the strong bittersweet chocolate taste I prefer.  JAL now also offers pre-flight meal reservation for an express meal or a vegan vegetarian meal supervised by Chef Yonezawa of the Japan restaurant No Code. \n\nOnce again, I enjoyed my JAL flight and felt extremely well cared for by the cabin attendants.  I happily recommend JAL everytime and the small deductions are for the older plane and the third party temporary lounge.",

I ended up finding an empty seat in economy to sit with my baby. No apologies or refunds were ever offered. \n\nIn addition, the business class seats weren't worth the cost of the upgrade. They were very dated and uncomfortable.  The food was the worst I've ever tasted. Service was disorganized throughout.

Once in Sapporo, I was told that it was not a business class seat, despite being 'Class J' which internationally is considered as business class, and despite SeatGuru showing the business (NOT Premium Economy) label on the aircraft plan (image attached). \nSo they are selling under 'Business' (now the app shows 'Class J') something which is not even Premium Economy. Here are the 'benefits' of this class:\n- NO lounge access\n- NO priority boarding. You are actually boarding LAST, I kid you not. You're in Group 5 \n- Catering: 2/3 glass of cold green tea, nothing else, over a flight > 1h30. Any other airline does better\n- NO priority baggage handling (ours were delivered towards the end of a 200+ passenger service\n2) Disorganised:\nIt's a nightmare to access the app as a guest if you're not a JAL member\nBoarding is a complete mess, self-checking, self handling of luggage\nYou receive information emails in Japanese!\nIn the lounge, the staff were completely out of their depth. When I complained about the situation, their first reaction was to give me a lecture on the back of en envelope on the various flight classes! When I moved on saying that I would not insist on accessing the lounge but wanted the coordinates of customer relations, they suggested that they would process the complaint themselves!\n3) Disappointing:\nChaotic boarding, and you are boarding last\nFull fare but half service - better fly JetStar!\n... this is supposed to be a Skytrax 5* airline? NO WAY!",

We spoke with customer service and said this is not ok but were told there is nothing that can be done. We asked if we could move our seats but were told because we paid for an option that we can not change our seating for the adults. 2 days before our flight leaves we received another email telling us the kid\u2019s seating has been moved again , this time to the centre of the plane next to complete strangers .we again tried to move next to our kids but again was told because we paid for an option we can\u2019t move. After an hour on the phone , we were told there is nothing that can be done, no one else to talk to and we just have to accept the seating plan. Japan Airlines think it is acceptable to split up a family and have strangers sitting next to young children.\nI wonder if any of the management or board members would allow this to happen to there family?",

YMMV. \n- Avoid transit between Haneda and Narita, as the train ride is a LONG 1h30m to 2h00m. Only acceptable with fit travellers willing to sprint. Difficult with young children or physically infirm unless there is a 4-hour minimum gap between flights. YOU HAVE TO COLLECT YOUR LUGGAGE and clear TWO immigrations when transferring between HND and NRT. Plan ahead!\n- The website struggles to take India-issue Visa and MasterCard; they really don't want our money ;) \n- The website is slow in every operation. \n- The iOS app is a thin layer over the website, so it's equally sub-optimal for 90% of the tasks\n- JAL needs to learn from Emirates, Etihad, and Qatar on how to deliver high-speed purchasing experiences, app services and features, and staff-led experience.",

I wasn't aware the restrictions were airline based as ANA who I flew with to Sapporo from Osaka allows hair straighteners such as mine on carry on luggage. I checked with airports and I guess assumed when ANA allowed this that the other airlines would too. I should have triple checked. I think it's silly that one airline allows and the other doesn't. Strange and not a nice experience. Therefore I will never fly JAL again. ANA was great and had a seamless experience and at least I would not have lost $500 had I flown with ANA again.",

I had seen assignments. from another agent, saying your flights were canceled because you missed the segment. I basically got three different stories from three different agents and ended up with a refund of only the taxes which was a total of $300.  \nWhat I think is crazy about Japan Airlines is the fact that they\u2019ll cancel your return tickets and not even notify you of that,  just because you miss some piece of some segment. No other airline in the United States will do this. This is absolutely ridiculous.  No way United, Delta, or American Airlines would cancel any of your return flights just because you miss a segment of one of their flights you already paid for.",

        "review_text": "Everything seem to be geared to Japanese passengers as though the rest of us didn't count. All announcements were primarily in Japanese and the stewards barely spoke or understood English. I felt discriminated against for various reasons. They announced two main meal choices. By the time they got to me, only one was available, a curry-based meal, which shows poor judgment on their part. With 10 more hours to fly, anything \"curry\" would cause foul odors. I couldn't bare the thought of eating something like that. There were no other choices and I politely refused. Poor judgement and poor thinking on their plan to stock insufficient quantity of a seemingly better meal. Later, they came around with a pastry and choice of tea or other drinks. I asked for coffee. Of course, I \"was the exception to the rule\" and had to ask three (3) times for my cup of coffee. And, to top it off, during our breakfast, it seemed as though I was transparent and they chose not to retrieve my tray until all other Oriental passengers on the plane were cared for. Stewards kept passing by and looking at my empty tray, but wouldn't even attempt to grab it. No, I didn't complain, act disrespectful, raise my voice or even show any displeasure. I just simply sat quietly. I have never experienced anything that bad even on a \"low-cost\" airline. I would not recommend this airline at any price, unless of course you are Japanese, in which case you will likely only travel on your home airline, anyway. Shame on Japan Airlines. I would have expected more respect and care for other people like me.",

As a result we had to book economy class - if we weren't going to Japan I wouldn't have booked them at all.  Also the booking platforms advertise the correct price 8K for both and then JAL won't let you book them.  Terrible terrible experience and took 4 hours to try and sort it out.

After her third repetition of the same question, my boyfriend asked her if she was a doctor.  She said no. He then asked if she would like to speak to the doctor that had treated me, and started to dial his number. She panicked, said no and called a supervisor.  \nThe supervisor said \"I just have one more question\" and then asked me, you guessed it \"what my symptoms were.\"  At this point I assumed we would miss our flight and would not be given our passports back, so I said, in desperation, that my muscles were too weak to walk to the gate, I did not have a contagious disease, I was not a danger to their passengers or crew, I was not going to die on their airplane and that I was now extremely angry.\nThat finally got our boarding passes issued and our passports back.  The flight itself and the onboard service and amenities were excellent. I grieve for people who use wheelchairs all the time and the humiliation they must suffer.  Shame on JAL.",

Okay, then we asked if we can cancel for medical reason, get a refund and purchase a new ticket for business class. They said yes on buying a new ticket with no refund. Fine!\n\nThe day we arrived at the airport to check in, they told us the economy seat that we paid for is now cancelled without refund for some safety reason. And that reason is for them to sell that seat for someone else! I\u2019m speechless! \n\nAt the same time, Expedia has not tried to help over the matter. Both Expedia and JP told us to contact the other party for the matter. None of them want to refund or help us to upgrade. \n\nI know it would be a lot if you book everything for your vacation separately, but next time I rather take my time to do that on my next trip, than have to deal with this headache, on top of the fact that our family is exhausted on this trip.\n\nNo one expects their vacation turn into a nightmare but craps happen and here is our story.",

        "review_text": "I flew recently on JAL Premium Economy from Sydney to Helsinki and back, flights 52,47,48 and 51.  I found the seats on the JAL Premium Economy extremely uncomfortable, even painful.\n\nI\u2019m a seasoned air traveller with Silver for Live from Qantas.  I flew Premium Economy with Qantas and Cathay Pacific and I believe the JAL seats are some kind of a design mistake.  They don\u2019t recline in the usual manner, just the bottom part, the seat, moves horizontally forward and the back support, being mechanically connected, attains a more reclined position.  The seat then attains a very unergonomic shape, not compatible with a human body.  This arrangement also automatically reduces the passenger\u2019s legroom, increasing the discomfort even further.\n\nThere are only two buttons to operate this contraption, one for the \u201crecline\u201d movement and the other one for the lower leg (calf) support. However, the lower leg support doesn\u2019t function at all due to its low range of motion.  So, it just hangs there.  I couldn\u2019t find a comfortable position and couldn\u2019t sleep at all.  The seats are also very hard and my bottom still hurts a week after the return flights.\n \nI find it hard to believe the Japanese people, renown for their design prowess and attention to detail, installed these seats on their national carrier!\n\nOn the other hand, the service was superb and the food exquisite albeit a bit small on size.  I also believe, the food was the same as in the economy class.",

        "review_text": "Could have flown with cheaper airline but wanted to try JAL. Flight was a morning flight.Flew on 777 economy JAL wider seats. First problem was checking in at Haneda, I had checked in online and all 3 boarding cards were on my mobile, we asked for printed off cards but we're told no. You had to do your luggage labels and place on conveyer belt and scan mobile boarding cards it wouldn't read ours, ended up a ground stewardess had to print off paper boarding cards for us for the scanner to work. I saw the queues getting longer as a lot of people seemed to be having problems, Haneda security queues ran right through the self check in stations so the place was very chaotic and people not knowing what was happening, so unlike the usual Japanese efficiency you experience everywhere else. On the plane now seats weren't noticeably any wider but legroom was really good. Flight entertainment was very poor, very limited choice of films, screen wasn't very big, seemed very dated with a pull out handset to control as touch screen didn't work. When seatbelts light went off they came round with a bag of mixed rice crackers and a bottle of water. After about an hour trolley came round with lunch and a choice of wine which wasn't very chilled, beer was and soft drinks. Handed a large plastic menu between 3 of us at time of serving, choice of pork or chicken...had to make your mind up quick, chose pork it was ok , served with rice but nothing like beautiful meals we ate in Japan, also had ice cream, no bread or cheese and biscuits, just some little dishes of tofu, cold broccoli , salad and some other cold veg, only ate some if it, very disappointing. After 4.5 hours into the flight they dimmed the lights and a steward walked round with a pole pulling down any window blinds that were still open, it stayed like that for hours, he walked around the cabin constantly looking in each row for?? to check we were sleeping? I felt I was in a nursery and being put down for my afternoon nap. They closed the curtains round the galley and only came round regularly offering green tea. About 7 hours into the flight the lights went on and we were handed a horrible milk tea flavoured kind of cake with white chocolate chips which was very dry to eat then offered coffee or green tea or soft drink. Now 7 hours into the flight we still had not been offered any trolley service offering alcohol other than at lunchtime . My husband went up to the galley and asked for 3 gin and tonics and the steward replied with surprised 3, my husband replied there are 3 of us... 1 each, when the male steward brought the drinks to our seats he never said a word but frostily sat them down with a napkin and another packet of the rice crackers. 11 hours into the flight my husband again went up to the galley and asked for 3 drinks but this time he was attended by a pleasant female stewardess, smiling, she brought them to our seats smiling. Half an hour later they came round the cabin with a drinks trolley offering alcohol drinks for the first time during the flight with only 2.5 hours before landing! At no time did they suggest to visit the galley for snacks or drinks, you had to decide that for yourself and depending on who was there how you would be treated. About 1.5 hours before landing they brought round something to eat, it was in a takeaway box and you had to open containers and mix it all up, chicken and noodles but it surprisingly good. Definitely wouldn't fly with JAL again, we flew Singapore airlines last time to Japan, economy was like first class, meals, service, entertainment nothing was a bother to them and they constantly came round with drinks and snacks trolley and toilets were immaculate, JAL toilets were just ok and extremely small.",

It's not western, it's not really mainstream Japanese. It was odd and definitely not suited to kids (even the kids meals!). Our kids left almost all of their meals, and most kids trays I saw went back full. We were glad we had some snacks packed for the kids. When I asked a hostess on the Narita - Melbourne flight if they had any bread rolls or snacks for the kids, as they had not eaten their meal, she simply said \"no\" and that was that! \n\n2. The online system for checking in is clunky when doing it for a family. AT points we ended up with all boarding passes on a single phone but their system at the airport requires everyone to have their own which didn't work (our kids are too young to have phones). They printed us out boarding passes in Narita when we were coming back to get us through one gate, but then refused to give us the boarding passes which meant we had the same issues later on in the airport. \n\n3. The entertainment system is sufficient but most other airlines have far better entertainment options and variety.",

        "review_text": "Wife and kids flew JAL from Finland to Haneda. I pre-booked their lounge passes with JAL Sakura Lounge. After a 14 hour flight, all they wanted to do is shower and have rest before the next flight which is in 5 hours time with another 9.5 journey to Sydney.\n\nThey went to the lounge front desk, they were denied entry. The lounge entry only allows entry 3 hour prior to your departure time, so if a flight takes off at 7pm, you can only use lounge at 4pm. However planes that take off at 7pm usually board at 30 - 45 min before take off. Basically you get ripped off for your lounge pass, paying for 3 hours and only allow to use 2 1/4 hours.\n\nWife asked them if they can set a timer and use the 3 hour and checkout themselves. NOPE, they wont allow you. Wife was really unhappy and tired so she gave up arguing with the front desk staff.\n\nSo I rang and spoke to JAL in the Australian phone line spoke to the phone consultant to lodge a complaint. The guy was very nice and I explained the situation and ask why the logic of paying for 3 hours but only get to use for 2.5 or 2 1/4 hours in lounge. He couldnt answer my question. I asked for cancellation of the lounge pass and get refund. He could not get a refund as they don't refunds apparently. What third world country is this?\n\nSo asked him to lodge a complaint for me and he said I have to use their website to lodge a complaint. He also can lodge a complaint. He said that all calls are recorded. I asked if all calls are recorded, what's the purpose of recording the calls if you cant use it to provide feedback. He couldnt answer the question.\n\nIam disappointed with JAL. Their lounge access timeframe has no logic what so ever. Also What third world country technology do they have working there, can record a phone call but cant use the recording as part of their complaint process?\n\nThis will be my first and last time using JAL. Customer service is so poor!!!!",

        "review_text": "I flew on Japan Airlines from Narita to Vancouver.  Prior to the flight, I used the JAL First Class Lounge at Narita based on my OneWorld Emerald status.  The lounge offers excellent food and service, I tried several dishes by scanning the QR code at my table and ordering and each was beautifully presented and delicious.  Special dishes included appetizers of Serrano ham with figs, marinated squid and marinated algae, and Manpuku Chinese soba noodles from Manpuku in Ginza, one of the oldest ramen shops in Tokyo.  At the main eating times, there are also sushi chefs making sushi to order.  There were also two different champagnes on offer - Joseph Perrier Brut and Pierre de Bry Brut.  There was plenty of seating in the lounge and in the dining area, and even a couple of massage chairs that offer a number of preset massage programs.  The lounge is an excellent pre-flight experience and most comfortable and relaxing before a long haul flight. \n\nThe boarding of the flight to Vancouver was delayed due to cabin preparation issues.  Fortunately the delay was only 10 minutes and the plane managed to make up the time in flight arriving on schedule. \n\nThe flight is operated with an older plane - B767-300.  Business class used the Sky Suite II seats in a 1X2X1 configuration with the window seats alternating between being separated from the window by a counter in the odd rows and right by the window in the even rows.  The Sky Suite II is not the most comfortable of seats as in bed position, the armrests do not lower down and therefore the bed is very narrow at shoulder level.  Therefore, I found it more comfortable to sleep with the seat in an incline position rather than fully flat.  Entertainment system is not a JAL strength so while there were enough movies on offer and some quite current, it was quite limited.  There were a lot of Japanese movies and TV programs that were either only available with English subtitles or not available with any English at all. \n\nIn flight service, as always, was elegant, understated and attentive. Meals served on board were delicious and, once again, beautiful to look at.  I had the Japanese dinner which starts with a bento box of many different items and then followed by a dish with three separate mains.  Japan Airlines is unique in that it offers a special coffee in business class for each flight, with a full origins and tasting description in the onboard menu just like for wines in a wine review.   The one for my flight unfortunately had high acidity, which I do not prefer, but fortunately it was also a rich coffee and very very smooth. \n\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed my flight with Japan Airlines.",

Our first flight on the 28th of July 2023 had a flight no: JAL914 from Naha to Tokyo (Haneda) with planned departure at 15:30 which was significally delayed.\nBecause of the delayed, we've missed our shuttle bus to Narita which we paid for and departed 19:25. Already on the plane (flight JAL914) we've notify the crew member about our problem. We kindly asked if we could get our luggages one of the first on a belt so we'll have a chance to catch the bus. Ironically, our luggages came out as the ones of the last.\nThen I approached the JAL personnel to present my problem and ask for potential solutions. We supposed to picked up our additional lugguages from currier \"Yamato\" and catch flight AY 0074 to Helsinki departing 23:05 (Finnair/JAL).\nIt was then , I've realized that I'm dealing with polite bench of kids where nobody speaks English. I understand it's very normal if we talking about local grocery store, but travel company STASION AT AIRPORT with no single person able to communicate with foreigner?\nThat's very low, cheap and armature to me.\nWith precious time on table I waited long time for somebody who supposabely speaks English, but then communication were bumpy and unproductive turning our already bad situation to even worse to waste more time.\nLet me point that I was asking for supervisor from the moment I approached the JAL counter which eventually I wasn't able properly to speak with. I was forced to take a TAXI and when I sat in, I've finally  saw the supervisor. With no second to spare I've just told her that I will complain about that.\nThe circumstance created by JAL cost me \u00a530 000+ for TAXI to Narita and tons of stress for whole family along.\nWe consulted JAL customer service before we choosing a ticket and we were ensured that everything should be OK with those we had.\nI also believe that air ticket also includes an airport fees like; taxes, security and others.\nIt was not our fault that flight was delayed but with absolutely NO HELP FROM JAL it became our big problem.\nI should mention that my wife is Japanese and we used JAL quite much until now with satisfaction, but after recent experience which is every traveler worst nightmare I don't think I will look positive at Japanese Air Lines.\nThe e-mail will be forwarded as a copy to whom it may concern.",

Nothing worth mentioning , apart from the amazing views i.e. much better than the dingy claustrophobic lounges DEL is infamous for.\n\nBoarding : Streamlined , with Business Class passengers being called as per the Priority category. Once inside the aircraft , the crew was proactively guiding the passengers.\n\nSeats / Layout : 1-2-1 in reverse herringbone fashion. The seats are comfortable , with the functions working perfectly fine. The only flaw being the seat belts - too tight for everyone I suppose , with a number of passengers requesting for extenders.\n\nService : Very friendly , courteous and consistent. No flaw at all. One of the best crews we've seen in the post-Covid world.\n\nFood & Beverage : We went for the Japanese meal , and it was good to taste & presented very well. In short , we had no regrets about our choice.",

Buying Business Class tickets gives you zero priority, unlike stated. The flight provides no drinks, and when we ordered the beef from the menu, we were told that there was no more beef meals. Flight attendants were \u201cinternational\u201d, yet did not understand anything in English so it was difficult communicating with them. Check in at departures was the slowest we\u2019ve ever experienced at well. This was the same for domestic flight check ins.

We did not fill out the special assistance request as it has never been an issue with airlines in the past so thought it would be ok. JAL changed the seating plan on 3 of our flights moving us from the seats we had chosen and on one flight to non adjacent seats. When we contacted the call centre and asked if we could change the seating arrangement and explained our situaton we were told no, they are the allocated seats there is nothing we can do. After going back and forth with the operator I said that we would be unable to fly with the current seating arrangement can they move someone else. Again told no, as they will not move passengers from their seating location eventhough ours had been changed??? Having no alternative I asked for a refund which they stated would take 2 to 3 months to process. Entirely unhappy with the whole situation I sent an email explaining our issues and got a quick reply saying sorry we ask for your understanding but nothing we can do. No offer of alternate flights etc just we changed your seat bad luck.. Lesson learned dont care about their customers, special assistance policy or anything so beware if you are thinking about flying with JAL",

I went so far as to go to the airport to try and get assistance. There were no ticket agents available so I went to the administrative office and was denied help from the manager because he said if he did it for me, he\u2019d have to do it for everybody. He told me to keep calling customer service and wait until someone answers the phone. There is no way to communicate virtually on the website. It was an infuriating experience to say the least!

        "review_text": "We spent some time during the peak season, June and July 2023, in different parts of Asia.  Being members of the oneworld alliance, we were not able to get on our preferred airline because of schedule conflicts.  Despite that, we were able to get tickets from one of the partners - JAL.\n\nFirst time flying JAL embarking from different countries within Asia and between the US, and the conclusion from different routes was that, it was consistently below standards; we all felt like we were in the economy class instead of business class.\n\nReasons for not flying JAL again:\n-the lounge in different parts of the world sucks, consistently (look at the ramen pic below)\n-food on the plane was bad, bland, cold, they went out Wagyu beef all the times\n-the aircraft was dirty, old, had an odor that was irritating\n-if you don't specify the kinds and the amount of food or utensils that you want, you will end up putting your finger on the buzzer many many times.  For instance, I asked for 'some bread', I was then given a kid-sized cold bun with no butter and jam; I asked for water and then I was given water with no ice, if don't ask for napkins or toothpicks, they won't put some on your tray.  The whole process was beyond frustrating and inefficient; it was like begging for food and services.  Other airlines will offer desserts, extra drinks to you without even asking to make sure that you are well fed and hydrated.  You will assume that fruit, salad, and bread are pretty standard.  However, if you don't ask, you get NONE.\n-they don't have a specify time for the last meal before landing, you have to time it yourself or else they will tell you that the pantry has been closed\n-they don't take away your trash even if they see it, I think they only take away your trash once or twice during the flight.  I needed to bag my trash nicely\n-after you order your last meal, they will tell you that it is your last order; very funny\n-they still struggle with English; asking for a cup of decaf tea and was given a decaf coffee and then a cup of tea with lemon\n-was asking for a glass of champagne Drappier and a glass of OPIA, the flight attendant kept clarifying to me they were both different, it was very funny, even that they wanted to put a cap on it\n-was asking for their Japanese white and red wine from Coco Farm, they were available on all my six routes\n-some of my traveling members are not Diamond / Emerald members, even though they knew that we were traveling TOGETHER, they put us in different lounges and groups for departure\n-did not inform us that our check in would be a training session, making us standing at the counter for a long time without apologies; they also forgot to give us back our membership cards after checking in, they had to chase us back while we were in the security area already\n-flight attendants were stiff and not trying to make you feel welcomed and at ease\n-the cabin temperature at night was way too warm to be able to sleep well\n-when they assigned seats, even though they knew that we were traveling TOGETHER, they separated us\n-the seat was uncomfortable and narrower\n\nI was surprised by the positive reviews on YouTube.  The truth is that it was not good at all.",

I called American Express and they were on the phone with Japan Airlines for nearly two hours. I erroneously disconnected the phone. I then called Japan airlines (800-525-3663) and I am still waiting for almost 2 hours.  I understand that if there is a change in configuration of the airplane that they need to change seats.  This was not the case.  I sense that because we are not of Japanese descent JAL felt that it was okay to change our seats.  We had made our reervations 10 months prior.  My husband is a \"wanna be pilot.\" He love looking out the window on take-off and landing. That is why I try to select our seats.  Additionally, we like to sit across from each other and not next to each other.  Patricia Newman",

An attendant asked me if I am willing to take  a different plane and flight , I said, yes. but she did not approach  me again . i assume non of the passenger was able to leave with another flight or plane, while we were boarding for our midnight flight , I heard another passenger discussing 26 passengers were able to leave earlier with a different flight  or plane , so I felt  a disappointment , I then asked one of the attendant what was the criteria they made on what passengers are allowed to leave earlier , she did not look at me or answer me, I had to ask  the question again and she said something that I could not understand. I could see all the attendants gathering together , some were looking at me strange , a couple of them pass by me and i was trying to ask for a letter that the earlier flight was cancelled , they would not look at me , they were trying to ignore me, then finally they gave me the letter before I boarded , no apologies and no  explanation was made, this is very poor customer service. I regret flying with them, I thought I would have a great experience compare to other airlines .",

        "review_text": "We took ANA's flight to Haneda in December 2022, then we took JAL's flight to Narita in April 2023. Both were six-hour flights. The differences we spotted were:\n\n1) Prices:\nJAL's tickets were about 10% cheaper than ANA's at the time of our booking.\n\n2) Seats and entertainment:\n- Legroom was less than ANA's.\n- Seats looked and felt older.\n- Entertainment system looked like it was running on an 1990s OS interface.\n- Movie selection was also less than ANA's.\n- Our retractable remote control had some bits of food on it... probably because the service team wasn't able to wipe down every single item during the short turnaround time.\n- Suggest to invest in newer planes/seats/entertainment systems which are totally touch-screen and high definition. Singapore Airlines had introduced an app that lets you use your own personal devices as remote controls since 2016... this technology was around for over 7 years! Also, no retractable remote controls = less dirty corners = less bacteria.\n\n3) Food:\nANA served us Japanese mixed nuts twice and dessert was H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream. Their soba tasted fresh.\nJAL didn't have pre-meal snacks, and their somen was... a little hardened.\n\n4) Toilets:\nANA's toilets were larger, and we observed the stewardesses checking the toilets almost after every passenger's exit, refreshening it ever so often. They also had a bottle of lavender-scented lotion and fragrance spray in each.\nThe JAL flight we took had none of the above.\n\n5) Stewardesses:\nANA's stewardesses were professional and very hardworking, you could tell that they were always on the move, but could seem a little cold as they were always rushing.\nJAL's stewardesses seemed friendlier. They smiled, greeted and were more patient when asking our kids to choose a toy (by the way JAL's toys beat ANA's cardboard plane) they liked.\n\nANA seemed to be the clear winner here. Hope JAL update their planes!",

Food was as if procured from some roadside eatery. Cabin crew seemed indifferent. I had to remind twice to get a glass of wine. \nTo add insult to injury the cabin crew handed over breakfast in plastic bags to us even before we had struggled to finish our dinner.  The plastic bag contained a STICKY muffin, flavoured yogurt of an average brand some cut fruits. All wasted.\nI assured my wife that food and service should be better in the next sector, Haneda-SFO and indeed it was, as if we were flying a different airline.\n\nIt is unfortunate that some reputed airlines give less than average service and quality of food  on sectors from & to Delhi. Some kind of apartheid??\nInflight entertainment was limited. Cabin crew announcements in English weren't clear.",

Moreover, our arrival in Tokyo was now timed to arrive 3 hours after our connecting flight departed for Osaka.  JAL had changed the time on the long-haul flight but not the connector.  Because our arrival was now late in the day, we could no longer connect the same day to Osaka so we had to pay for a hotel night at NRT because JAL refused.  They also refused to book a new connecting flight to Osaka so we had to make our own arrangements including expense for the Tokyo to Osaka flight.  For as premium as the long-haul service was, this lack of appropriate response from JAL was quite disappointing.",

Flight times were between 13-14 hours each way.\n\nSeats and general comfort:\nMe and my partner are not the slimmest of people and sometimes travel on planes/trains etc can feel a bit cramped so we were very pleasantly suprised to find on both flights that even in the economy seats on JAL the seats were really spacious, felt more like a business class sized seating than economy which was great for us!\n\nThe seats were super comfortable, you have plenty of leg room (my partner is tall and could fully stretch out his legs) loads of space for your bags and bits you want while on the plane and even when the person infront reclines you don't really notice any difference in the space around you which is fantastic.\n\nThe head rests are really comfortable and are able to be adjusted in multiple ways to suit everyone.\n\nSeat material again increased the comfort as kept a nice temperature (not too hot or cold etc).\n\nBoth flights the air stewards controlled the lighting and dropped it to night time settings except during take off, landing and when food and drink was being served etc and the lighting subtly transitioned at each point which was nice.\n\nFood and Drink:\nThe food on both flights was wonderful, I personally preferred the food on the flight out there but when I served a dish on the way back that I just couldn't have eaten (lots of fish) they very kindly swapped it out for a vegatarian dish they had spare.\n\nFlight out to Tokyo:\nDinner: we both opted for the Chicken cooked in Japanese radish sauce with rice rather than the beef dish they offered, this came with some small dishes on the side; soba noodles, smoked salmon cream cheese & dried tomatoes, vinegared cucumber & wakame sea plant, bread and butter, fresh salad, shortbread, ice cream. It was all really lovely but the smoked salmon side was especially good.\nSnack: Red bean bun, rice cracker snack pack\nBreakfast: omelette with tomato ragout, hash browns & turkey sausage, yogurt, fresh fruits, croissant\nDrinks throughout: Generally whatever drinks you wanted, plenty of choice of soft drinks, a few alcoholic options and then several opportunities for hot drinks. \n\nFlight back from Tokyo:\nI opted for the grilled chicken cacciatore with mushrooms and pasta\nMy partner opted for the hamburger steak in ginger with corn & mustard rice.\nBoth of which were nice but not quite as nice as the flight out.\nThe sides were: sansho pepper kinpira with lotus root & fried tofu, steamed chicken & zucchini with tahini sauce, salad of quinoa, mochi mugi barley &\nfermented vegetable, fresh salad with dressing, ice cream\nSnack: rice cracker snack pack, miso soup (this was really special, just what I needed)\nLunch:\nchewing Tuna, Clam & Millet Short Pasta in a Japanese Ginger Sauce (this was the one I just couldn't eat - it was far too fishy for me but the air hostess promptly found me an alternative of a mushroom curry which was delightful and very accommodating)\nOrange Jelly with Nata de Coco (which was very tasty_\nDrinks throughout: Generally whatever drinks you wanted, plenty of choice of soft drinks, a few alcoholic options and then several opportunities for hot drinks. \n\nCleanliness and Bathrooms\nThe planes were both really clean but I have to mention how clean and generally excellent the toilets were on the flight back to London!\nIt had the most spacious airplane toilet room I have ever seen, it was delightful, it had little luxuries like deodorant/freshener spray, face towels, and was decorated lovely.\n\nEntertainment:\nPlenty of films, shows, music and other bits to keep you entertained, I think I watched about 6 films in total, 2 on the way out and 4 on the way back...  but there were plenty more I could have watched, I liked being able to make a music playlist also from the songs they have available and given there were so many chilled piano and nature sounding songs I was able to create a bit of a sleep playlist.... was exactly what I needed.\n\nCustomer service:\nSo friendly, so accommodating, really brilliant service on both flights and in the airports.\n\nAt all points where turbulance might be encountered they gave fair warning as an announcement and given my partner is a nervous flyer especially with turbulence it made it easier for him to feel reassured, as he said - two of the best flights he has taken, both were so smooth, with minimal turbulence really even given the warnings.... just brilliant!\n\nBaggage came through quickly at both airports and seemed to have been handled with care.\n\nFlight back arrived about 1 hour earlier than I expected based on JAL original time on app, winning!\n\nThe views both landing into Tokyo and especially taking off from Tokyo with Mount Fuji in the background - incredible!",

        "review_text": "The Premium parts: 1) Sakura lounge access, though the lounge is not among the better world lounges. It was too small for the huge crowds, and very noisy, full of screaming babies for hours on end. Catering is uninspiring \u2013 a few Japanese-style dishes. Strangely, there is absolutely no fruit \u2013 a very basic food item. They did have shower rooms and a quiet room with massage chairs. And lots of alcohol. The wines were of high quality. Also, very many kinds of spirits including Japanese brands. And the lounge is clean. But the fact that Premium Economy gets you lounge access is unusual and a big plus. 2) Separate check-in counters for Premium Economy rather than together with Economy. And checked-in luggage gets priority after Business Class. 3) Some amenities on board \u2013 slippers and a small bag containing eye shades and ear plugs. 4) The seat is slightly better than Economy, though it is a far cry from the flat-bed Business seats. Basically, you can recline a little more and have a little more space than Economy. The Economy parts: 1) The catering is awful \u2013 exactly the same with Economy meals, though Premium Economy gets you 2 extra alcoholic items on request \u2013 a quarter bottle of champagne and shochu, a Japanese liquor. 3) Nothing in the bathroom \u2013 no eau de toilette. 4) Service is polite and efficient but rather cold and distant. I suppose this is the Japanese style but the Southeast Asian airlines have warmer crew.\nSeat: 3/5\nService: 3/5\nMeals: 2/5\nInflight entertainment: 4/5\nLounge: 3/5\nFinal thought: If you\u2019re small size, there is absolutely no reason to go for Premium Economy. If you\u2019re big size, it might make the journey that slightly more tolerable.",

Having 2 seats by the window means no disturbing or being disturbed, if you're travelling as a couple.  The food if you're not vegetarian was good. The cabin staff were excellent, and the toilets were  spotlessthroughout both 14 hour flights\nThe negatives: The vegetarian food was poor. And there was very poor inflight entertainment. Out and back from Tokyo, one of our screens didn't work. There were 3 games, all board games. There weren't many films. And you pay extra for wifi. I paid for it on the way back, but it only worked for a few hours - although to be fair, when I complained to the provider ( not JAL) they did give me a full refund.",

I had five different interactions with agents to try and understand whether I needed a hotel to stay in for an overnight connecting flight resulted in them saying that I may be denied entry for not having a hotel booked. Furthermore they thought that I did not require a declaration and/or other documentation. After going thru customs and talking to information desk I was made aware that a booking was not required for an overnight layover even though the main terminal closes at 11 pm- the whole airport doesn\u2019t close which is what they were saying. Nothing was mentioned in my booking that I needed a hotel booking, they continued to state that one was needed but they were wrong. \n\nTheir English speaking ability and comprehension of what is required for a foreigner to do an overnight transfer is poor. I would not recommend this airline due to their negligence and the confusion that they caused while I was traveling on their airlines.\n\nFor their incompetencies, poor English skills, and understanding of foreigners travel requirements for layovers - I will never nor recommend travel to Japan via their airline. It not only represents their airline poorly but also Japan itself.\n\nI hope that they improve but as an American I saw them treat a minority in a similar position as me with the same disregard and misunderstanding. \n\nFood was ok. Foot space is ok, width of seats is not accommodating and I am 5ft6 120 lbs, so keep that in mind when booking. The stress that their gross ignorance of overnight layover requirements has caused along with their poor English skills and impersonal \u201cnod\u201d and smile to pass the problem onwards to someone else is appalling.",

The windows were only unlocked as we approached the Japanese coastline.\n\nOn taking my seat I did notice what looked like some food or juice residue on the window and cabin wall near it and mentioned it to the crew and they seemed truly horrified and got some wipes out and cleaned it off apologising profusely.\nThe service onboard was fine with good food and drinks including Maison Brutin Besserat de Bellefon Rose Brut NV champagne being served. I pre-ordered the western beef menu before my flight which was great.\n\nThe crew was professional but I got the impression that they lacked some confidence when speaking with English speaking customers.\n\nOne of the great benefits in flying JAL on my route which was Paris to Tokyo to Sydney was the fantastic luggage allowance which was 3 bags at 32kg each which is an awful lot of luggage but after just over three months in Europe I managed nearly 70kg split over three bags.\n\nOverall a pretty good flight.",

We purchased an extra premium economy seat for our 1 year old as we were told we could strap her into a car seat on top of the premium econ seat. Just prior to boarding they confiscated our car seat as they were unsure of the regulations (turned out they were incorrect) and offered no solution for our 1 year old but to carry her on our lap. At one stage they said just put her in the seat asleep and strap the belt on. The belt did not fit and she fell down and banged her head. We asked if we could trade our 2 premium economy seats for 1 bassinet seat in any class (economy, premium, business). They refused to do this even though there were available seats as they said it would disrupt the passengers who paid extra for these front row seats (none of them had kids). It was very ironic given we paid a lot more for a premium economy seat that we could not use. I wrote a few letters of complaint to their complaints department. It has been 3 months and quite a few follow ups and I have not had one singe reply",

I shared our story how we go married in Costa Rica, etc. Then she and other ladies made me a gift bag to give to my wife. Wow how nice is that! I really like the food as well. I only wish I could afford a first class ticket.\nIf you are considering Japan Airlines, I recommend it. Remember to be gracious to the staff on board, they are nice people. Any annoying rules are probably the government's fault.",

        "review_text": "I flew from Vancouver to Bangkok connecting at Narita airport onto JL717 from Narita to Bangkok.  I had about a 90 minute layover but due to the airport being much busier than when I last flew through in late September, I did not have enough time to use the Japan Airlines lounge after taking time to purchase some things at the duty free stores.  Back in September, practically no stores were open at the satellite terminal and only the main Akihabara duty free shop in the main terminal was open.  At that time, there were almost no customers and I found staff were actually approaching me to introduce products since I was the only customer in the duty free store.  This time the experience was quite different.  I went back to Akihabara duty free to try and buy some things but the line-up for cashiers was so long that it ran outside the boundaries of the store and there was no hope that I could line up and pay for purchases before it was time to board my connecting flight.  On the other hand, there were many small duty free shops open in the satellite terminal so I was able to buy a few things from there.  Generally the airport was much busier and many more shops and eating places were open inside the main terminal and the satellite terminal.  It seems the general expectation is that it is going to get much busier at Narita airport in the next couple of months as tourists from China start coming in force. \n\nJL717 to Bangkok boarded on time for its scheduled departure at 6 pm but pushback was delayed to 6:15 pm as there were passengers who had checked in but who did not show up on time to board.  Then there was a long wait for take off and the flight finally took off at 6:48 pm.  Fortunately the flight was smooth once enroute and landed slightly early in Bangkok Suvarnabhumi airport at 11:19 pm. \n\nThe flight was operated using a B787-800 with a 2X2X2 seat configuration in business class using the JAL Sky Suite seat.  All seats have direct aisle access as the aisle seat is slightly offset from the window seat next to it.  I actually like this seat very much, much more than the newer Sky Suite II seat as the original Sky Suite I has armrests that lower down when the seat is put into flat bed position and therefore is much wider at shoulder level in bed position than Sky Suite II.  It also does not lower down as much as Sky Suite II, which seems a bit too close to the ground when in bed position.  For the Sky Suite I seat, in bed position, you can sit up at the edge of the bed and you are seated at quite a natural level in terms of angle of the knees.  Sky Suite I also has a fixed ottoman/footrest under which is ample storage for a carry on bag, and there are storage compartments and shelf space all around the seat so lots of places to put things even without the retractable table open.  The retractable table also swivels so you can get up out of your seat without having to fully retract the table by swinging it out of the way.  I find the Sky Suite I seat is very comfortable to sleep in when in bed position, much better than Sky Suite II. \n\nThe flight was not very full with about 8 seats empty in business class out of a total of 30 seats in business class. \n\nI had pre-ordered my meal as the menu could be reviewed on-line around the beginning of the month.  For flights originating from Japan, JAL business class has meals designed by famous restaurants in Japan.  For this flight to Bangkok, the Western meal was designed by three Michelin star French restaurant L\u2019Effervescence in Tokyo, so while the Japanese meal was designed by the also impressive one Michelin star Ginza Tokyo restaurant Ren Mishina and the Japanese meals on JAL flights from Japan are always spectacular and spectacularly presented, I opted for the Western meal of wagyu beef sirloin with wasabi cream sauce and spinach gnocchi.  The meal did not disappoint.  From the appetizers to the bread to the very tender and well marbled wagyu beef sirloin, it was an excellent meal, one of the best Western meals I have had on a flight in recent memory. \n\nAn interesting feature in JAL flights is that a special coffee of the month is served in business class, and the menu includes an introduction of the coffee of the month together with tasting notes.\n\nAs always, service on JAL was excellent.  Not only are the cabin attendants attentive, but they are polite and discreet in the unique Japanese manner that Western airlines can never replicate.  Also as always, the toilets are much cleaner than on most other airlines as the cabin crew clean the toilet after almost every use by passengers.  \n\nMasks are required to be worn on board except when eating or drinking and it seemed compliance with the requirement by passengers was very good throughout the flight.  \n\nThe flight was an evening flight and I was able to sleep fairly well for a few hours during the flight.  Overall I enjoyed the flight very much \u2013 enjoyed an outstanding dinner, slept well in the Sky Suite I seat, and appreciated the understated elegant service from the cabin crew.  \n\nI was concerned about arriving in Bangkok as Thailand had recently changed its rules for arriving passengers.  Despite being fully re-opened to tourism since October 1, 2022, Thailand on January 9, 2023 reinstituted a vaccination requirement and a requirement for health insurance for Covid-19 medical expenses if a traveller originated from a destination or is going to a destination that requires a pre-departure PCR test.  Even more confusing, by the morning of January 9, 2023, Thailand cancelled the vaccination requirement.  I was going to overnight at Suvarnabhumi airport and then catch a flight the next day to Hong Kong, which has a pre-departure rapid antigen test requirement.  The announcements from Thailand were not clear, as least in English media, so I was worried I would be asked to provide evidence of health insurance.  I was also concerned that the flight did not provide landing forms for Thailand, which I had been used to filling out in pre-pandemic times.  Fortunately on arrival at Suvarnabhumi airport, I was able to use the priority immigration lines for business class passengers, no landing forms were required and no questions were asked about vaccination history or medical insurance and I was through to the luggage claim area very quickly.",

        "destination": "Tokyo",
        "type_of_route": "International",
        "review_text": "I flew Japan Airlines from Vancouver to Bangkok in January 2023.  First leg was JL17 from Vancouver to Tokyo Narita.  JAL does not have its own lounge in Vancouver and uses the Plaza Premium lounge.  The Plaza Premium lounge is open to anyone who wants to pay to use it but nevertheless it was not very crowded the day I went.  It has a food station with hot foods (meat lasagne, tri-color pasta and buttered corn), hot soup, and desserts in a refrigerated case.  That day, the lounge did not open the second section at the back of the lounge that has an additional food counter that was a pasta station on a previous visit. \n\nFlight JL17 boarded on time.  It is operated with a B767 with a 1X2X1 seat configuration in business class with the Sky Suite II seat.  I was actually hoping for the B787-800 with the Sky Suite I seats instead, which is sometimes used on the Vancouver-Narita route, as I like the Sky Suite I seat much more \u2013 it has a larger video screen, is much wider at the shoulders in flat bed position, has storage for a carry on bag under the fixed ottoman and has storage space and shelves all around the seat.  The Sky Suite II has a staggered configuration with a fixed counter and headphone storage cabinet next to the seat.  Odd numbered rows have window seats with the fixed counter between the window and the seat and the seat located right next to the aisle, whereas even numbered rows have the fixed counter between the seat and the aisle and the window right next to the seat so even row window seats have more privacy and better window views.  I was in 2A, which is nicely located near the front of the cabin where both toilets for business class are located.  The arm rests on the Sky Suite II seat are fixed and do not lower down in flat bed position.  As a result, in flat bed position, the bed is very narrow at the shoulder and it is difficult to sleep on one\u2019s back rather than on the side.  As the flight was mostly a daytime flight, I found it more comfortable to use the seat in recline position to nap rather than flatbed position to sleep. \n\nThe flight was quite full with all seats in business class occupied except for one in the last row reserved for flight crew rest use.  The flight was scheduled for 12:45 pm, pushback was on time at 12:47 pm and take off was at 12:59 pm.  The flight landed at around 4 pm, about half an hour early.  JAL has always been very reliable with its scheduling with flights departing and arriving on time consistently. \n\nAs usual service was exemplary on the flight.  JAL has some of the cleanest toilets throughout the flight as the cabin attendants are constantly going in to tidy up the toilet after almost every use. Service of drinks and meals was courteous in typical JAL fashion and meals always look beautiful as well as taste delicious.  I have a low tolerance for alcohol but was intrigued by the unfamiliar champagne offering \u2013 Champagne Drappier Carte D\u2019Or N.V. \u2013 and so asked for literally a tablespoon.  Usually I end up receiving a quarter glass or a third of a glass but to my pleasant surprise, the purser actually did pour me about one or two tablespoons of champagne, perfect for a sip and taste!  I ordered the Japanese meal, which started with a bento box with 5 compartments each filled with different appetizers and colorfully presented.  This was followed by the main of simmered chicken sukiyaki.  \n\nOne unique feature of JAL flights is that a coffee of the month is served in business class.  The menu even has a description of the chosen coffee, including tasting notes just like for wines.  \n\nOne weak point for JAL is its in flight entertainment system.  It has fewer movies and TV programs on offer compared to other airlines and a number of non-movie video programs were offered in Japanese only without even English subtitles. \n\nOn arrival, an announcement was made to stay in our seats as Japanese authorities would decide the order of disembarkation.  For our flight, those who were entering Japan or transiting to domestic flights were asked to de-plane first while international connection passengers were told to wait to de-plan about 10 minutes later.  However the lost time was quickly made up as security for international connections was very quick so I was back into the departures part of the terminal by around 4:30 pm for my connecting flight to Bangkok. \n\nAs always, I enjoyed my JAL flight from Vancouver to Narita \u2013 good food, excellent polite service and a comfortable seat.",

Did not believe I had a business class tickets, even after I repeated three times. She kept trying to push me out of the line and putting people in front of me. I finally went around them and saw a third shorter line, that made her angry. \n\nOn the flight I could not get anyone to bring me water. I became dehydrated. When I asked for food, I was asked if I was sure if I should be eating that. She was trying to say I was fat. So in turn she brought my food ice cold, with no water, so I couldn't eat it. I am not fat btw. I am a size 6. And even if I was, I paid 14k for the seat. Give me water and food.",

We recently read very negative reviews of JAL on Trip Advisor and Trustpilot.uk related to last minute changes, cancellations, selling pre-booked tickets for higher prices, no one to talk to at customers services, etc. All this made us very nervous about our tickets as JAL had also made a couple of changes on our tickets with some incoherence. We need to point out, though, that each change was communicated to us via email. With that background, we called JAL (1 855 604 1744 for USA and Canada) and was so happy and relieved that: \na) an agent came on the line right away; b) she was very pleasant, knowledgeable and helpful with updating our itinerary based on changes for which we agreed; c) she also ensured updating of our seatings with the best available options; and finally d) sent us confirmation and ticketing promptly as indicated during the telephone conversation. \nIn summary, we are very impressed with JAL quality of customers services and up to now, we must say that was our best experience. (we travel a lot , around the world, with the best rated airlines as QATAR, Singapore Airlines, ANA, Cathay Pacific, Air France, etc). \nWe hope the actual trip starting in January 2023 will be as planned and enjoyable. Why not?",

When I tried to write a written complaint on their website I got a response over a week later advising that if I wanted to make a voluntary change to my flight I needed to call the same number I had called twice before (and written about in my complaint). There is in reality NO way to complaint to JAL. If you ask to speak to a manager they refuse, they repeat the same line over and over again and have to be the most inflexible and unhelpful airline out there. \n\nThe story - \n\nThe ticket was originally booked from Glasgow to London and then on to Australia (business class). When plans changed we enquired whether we could just board the flight in London and not Glasgow. did not seek a refund or any other change. \n\nWe were advised that changes were impossible, than if the flight wasn't boarded in Glasgow the whole ticket would be cancelled. We will be forced to fly from London up to Glasgow, stay in a hotel over night, and then fly back to London, in less than 24 hours. We have to fly to another country in order to fly back to our starting point - it's insane! Imagine missing your flight back to Australia because the completely pointless flight you are being forced to take is cancelled, and although you could board the flight in London you now wont be allowed to. \n\nI understand the inflexibility of a ticket which doesn't allow changes, but we weren't technically trying to change the ticket, just board when the flight stopped in London.  The absolutely refusal to even appear to try to be accommodating was completely shocking. \n\nIn addition the stop over on the way to London changed to a massive sixteen and a half hours over night. There is no hotel offered so I hope you enjoy laying on the floor of an airport terminal because they kick you out of the business class lounge at 10pm.",

        "review_text": "Let me start first by giving credit to JAL in operating long distance 787 with 2 -4 -2 configurations.. This definitely gets rid of at least 2 most dreaded middle seats.\nCheckin agents did a great job and when they shifted as gate agents, they were equally impressive that the whole boarding process took about 20 mins ( with about 95% occupancy on the flight). \nThe worst part was with the catering ..\n1. I had ordered an oriental vegetarian meal and both the meals were served with just steamed rice and steamed vegetables .. NO condiments.. SERIOUSLY JAL.. Not even pepper and salt which are staple in the cutlery pack.. Cost cutting on salt and pepper?  No sauce to add or mix in!!\n2. The other passengers (who opted for regular meals) were served ice cream and when I asked for one, the flight attendant did give a \u201cserious knee jerk reaction) that she pulled the tray away from her ( as if I was snatching it)( and said that it was for other passengers and I cannot be given one.  ..Appalling service and training from JAL!!! \n3. Later I saw all unused ice creams being dumped into trash while standing in the galley area. (.. JAL can\u2019t you ask for a second serving if some PAX want it or keep it in the so called snack bar that you operate like done in British Airways.( note my 2nd point above, you did not serve one to someone who asked for it ).\n4. The so called self serve snack bar had a packet of potato crackers - smallest potato chips I\u2019ve ever seen and may be in the count of 10 -1 5 of them.. What is the purpose of this ?\n\nI think JAL is very contended in staying out the top league ( while its National competitor is stepping on the gas every notch).  \nIf you ever think of ordering Vegetarian Oriential meal, be prepared to eat steamed rice and steamed vegetables ( like some monks do).. \n\nI\u2019m traveling NRT - SFO tomorrow and this time I\u2019ve switched to a different offering..Waiting to see what\u2019s in store !!\n\nTime for JAL to grow up!!!",

The only thing which could possibly have been better was the pod seating on the Boeing 787 (too tight, limited choice of seat positions). The food was better than any Japanese restaurant (that we can afford) in the SF Bay Area USA, the flight attendants were the model of Japanese care and dignity--and you knew everyone was diligent and competent in all they did. The business class lounge in Narita is huge and seems to offer anything you could need. In the future, I will spring for JAL even if it costs extra. It's worth the money.",

        "review_text": "I will write this in a list form\n\nPoint 1: Leaving Japan\n\n- Lady at check-in counter made me stand there forever because she kept flipping through my passport and looking at the computer over and over again as though she was looking for something she could not find. Why did she not ask me? I don't know. So I waited there, \n- In the end, realising how annoyed the people in the line behind me were, and my own frustration, I had to ask her, \"Is there anything wrong, or something I can help you with\"\n- Then she says she cannot find my visa or ESTA for America. \n- Mind you, when i handed her the passport, I had flipped to the page with the Visa together with all the COVID related document in that page. \n- Thats solved.\n-Proceeding to the security checkpoint, the man there tells me to stop and immediately closes the line in front of me using the retractable banner . He does not explain why he is stopping me.\n- I ask him what is wrong, he tells me to just wait. \"Sir what am I waiting for?\"\n- He does not explain, my Japanese speaking colleague asks him. He then explains that someone at the check in counter forgot to check the expiration date on my visa, so now i have to wait a few more minutes for that same lady to come down here and note it before I can pass through.\n- She comes, writes the information down on brown paper with a pen. In my head I am thinking: Ma'am, why did I have to endure that torture at the counter if you were not taking down my info? But guess what, i cant argue nor show my rage much because I dont speak fluent Japanese and they barely speak English. So I am boiling inside. \n\nThe whole thing took forever and the lack of communication was just very annoying especially when traveling with three other people who's experience was so different because of their Japanese nationality (no need for visas and hence no need for this drama)\nBut the real question is, was this their first day dealing with a US visa? was I their guinea pig? Why were they so confused and uncoordinated? \n\nPoint 2\n\nNo wifi on plane\n\nPoint 3: coming back to Japan\n\nOn JL015 from LAX to Haneda\n\n-Flight was delayed about 30 minutes, but still the airplane staff were ushering everyone to stand up from the lounge seats to stand in line, even though the plane was not ready. Why?\n-Some people noticing that it is going to be a while sat back down but the JAL staff were walking around like police dogs telling people to stand. I don't get it. baggage on your back and crowds getting smooshed together after scanning boarding passes is not the right tone to set for a 12 hour flight. \n-On top of that, the in-flight meals were a choice between chicken and a veggie curry. Guess what, they ran out of chicken before they even made it half way through the flight (What was the logic there?). I told the lady I dont want to eat, and she still brought me the meal anyway. I have no idea why. To be honest their menu was not appetising to begin with.\n-Again, no wifi and this time movie selection was so different from the JAL line 906 when we first came (Only has older movies yet still listed them as new releaes). Urghh.\n\nIf I could avoid JAL I would, because this was probably the worst flights and services I have received in my whole life. but I will most likely be back on board again, and I do hope that someone with authority gets to see this and makes the necessary changes for the comfort of the customers. We are paying way too much tp be treated like this.\n\nThanks for reading.",

Part of flight is the overall service. No way to write comments on their email as it is directed to online form which rejects it over and over with no clear direction as to why? It is easy to score great rating when not a single person can deliver negative comments. \n\nSecond has to do with JAL website unable to find me in the system. Every time. Is it a name issue? Why is there no search criteria by flight number? The only thing is to pick search and system arrives to \u201cnot found \u201c each time.  When You have late flights and your crew is not here all I can do is sit with crowds at the front of the airport , no way to check my luggage, go shopping or eat as traveling by myself it is cumbersome to leave the bags.  There is just a card on the counter showing 7:30 PM return ( I guess it is related to when someone will show but can\u2019t be sure as it is in Japanese.. ) Is there no  way for JAL to show another terminal which may have a way to check bags and go through  the security? I was counting at getting some work done in the lounge.  Not happy. Not well designed and shows no respect for a customer. Terrible website for what I am doing. No instructions and it keeps rejecting even when those fields are not highlighted in red as required\u2026Silly and frustrating. JAL app has a very very low rating yet no one is doing any improvements? \nFlight is just one part of the travel service and JAL failed before I even started\u2026",

For biz class! \nWhen comes to inflight entertainment, the selection was very limited, and 90% of the movies came with Japanese subtitle which\u2019s very annoying. \nSakura Lounge at Narita offered beer and coffee, the only \u201cfood\u201d in there was small packaged seeds with two pieces of almonds in each pack. \nThe Eva Air lounges are top quality in all regards including food choices.",

As I sit at home recovering from this trip, however, I am nothing but disappointed. Mostly because my last flight from LAX-JFK on AA somehow provided better service than any of my JAL flights. I had ordered a Vegetarian/Vegan meal which was confirmed on my outbound trip but not on the return, leading to a very unpleasant experience. The Vegan meals when they were offered on the outbound were pathetic. For the main course of a meal on a 13 hour flight from ORD-NRT was one small boiled carrot with white rice and a piece of cabbage over the top! The second meal of that flight was slightly better, and the connecting flight had passable service except for the pre-landing meal in CGK which was a bun with maybe two bites of vegetables served in blue plastic wrap! That\u2019s somehow supposed to be acceptable in BUSINESS CLASS??? I mean, across the board the hard-product on JAL sucks unless you have the Apex-Suite [SkySuite Original] on the 77W and select 787-8/9s, however, I had the SkySuite III on my flights from/to the U.S.A, and the Shell Flat Neo my flights to/from CGK. To think what airlines invest in business class in the transatlantic market from NYC on flights of similar length or even shorter than NRT-CGK-NRT, JAL should feel the shame of offering this product that was at no point competitive. I can\u2019t fault any of the cabin crew, however, their main objective seemed to be avoiding conflict, which I of course was not going to engage regardless of the meal discrepancy I had on the return. I you do not have status with JAL or OneWorld and are \u201cONLY\u201d flying Business Class, expect ZERO special treatment or priority, including baggage delivery. The airport experience boarding the NRT-LAX flight was shocking, as they corralled everyone into the gate area at Narita only to line up Group 1, have those in Group 1 stand up waiting in line, while everyone else crowded around to wait, including those in Group 2, the standard Business Class boarding group. To be honest, and I am being truthful in my personal experience, I have flown similar distances on other airlines in Economy Class and felt more rested and less ripped off than in Japan Airlines Business class. Further, the entertainment selection and hardware  is not sufficient for the lengthy itineraries that JAL sells. It truly makes me sad to write such a harsh review, especially when the service was so well intentioned, or at least manufactured to be, however, I could never in good conscience recommend JAL\nBusiness Class. When the only positives are the showers in the Sakura Lounge at Narita and the packaged rice crackers with two [yes I\u2019m serious] almonds in each pack, something probably has to be done to improve the passenger experience.",

We then paid the additional charge to Qantas, all good, we thought.\nJapan airlines then informed us  on our arrival via their supervisor our tickets were FAKE!\n We were not confirmed on the flight.\n Yes, FAKE and we were to call our bank immediately and put a hold on the payment.\nEarlier that morning we had double checked with Qantas (Eddie from customer service was great not only did he confirm all good he called back to make sure everything was ok).\nUntil we got to the check in at JAL\nWe showed our email confirmed tickets to the JAL manager\u2026. Answer no\nWe showed our receipt of payment\u2026. answer no\nQuote: \u201c you have been scammed, call your bank and stop payment\u201d \nThe manager did imply we could but another ticket!!!\nWhile my wife tried calling our bank I thought, hang on wait. I called Qantas customer service and asked for Eddie, no problem. Eddie asks how I can help.\nHe was stunned, he says\u2026. Tell them to look at their screen.\nJAL Manager says no its FAKE and walks away from me.\n( His name he would not show us, but it was not Japanese he was in his mid-50\u2019s and the name sounded like Isuze with a mid-European accent)\nI call Eddie again; he says this is crazy ask him to get on the phone with me. At this point ( sometime later) the manager is now trying to avoid me, I call to him in front of everyone ( and in a very calm respectful tone) please speak to Eddie from Qantas here is the phone.\n Eddie says to tell you all you have to do is look at your screen!!\nHe still refuses to talk with Eddie.\nWell, well the manager looks at the screen and guess what???? Our tickets were there all along.\nNo apology nothing.\nThank you, Qantas, thank you Eddie.\nJAL if this is the quality of your management you have problems big problems\nAnd by the way the flight was fine.",

Not able to fully recline seat into a flat bed and was very claustrophobic.\n\nBusiness class lounge at Haneda airport has very limited food options and no showers. After a 12 hour flight (and then another 11 hours to come) being able to have a shower during a layover is very important, and all JAL had was a small change room. Also no shops open I. The transit area at Haneda so not able to do any duty free shopping.\n\nWon't be travelling JAL again.",

We would book directly with Japan Airlines. However, recently this week, my parents misread their ticket for 8PM instead of 8AM. When they showed up to the airport, they found out that they had missed their flight. Completely understandable, it was their fault that they misread it. When they went to the ticket counter for Japan Airlines at Tan Son Nhat International Airport, they people there told them that there is nothing that they could do about them missing their flight. They would either need to buy a completely brand new ticket or call up whoever they bought the ticket from. I explained to them that we bought it from Japan Airlines. They said there is nothing they could do...\n\nAt this time, my parents are stuck in Vietnam and I am in Dallas, so I waited for the customer service line to open and called them immediately. When I explained to the representative, he basically told me that their policies state that since my parents miss their flight, they lost their value and they would have to buy a brand new ticket for $2K each. I asked them if there is anything that they could do to help because we do not have $4K to spend immediately to get my parents back. They told me word for word, \"well if you want to get them back to America then you have to pay $4K.\" Completely heartless. I understand your policies but I was asking for help because it was something that we could not afford, I do not know the average person's affordability but for my family, we do not have $4K to simple drop in a moment. I can say without a doubt, we will never miss a flight again or ever do any service with Japan Airlines. There are plenty of other airlines out there who will make a connection to Asia, if I have to eat less to save more money to fly another airline, I definitely would. I called Singapore Airlines and they were able to help quickly and reasonably. Thank you Singapore Airlines.",

You are so excellent in what you do, helping JAL customers. Thank you again for being so awesome! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udfc6\n\nI would also like to commend JAL\u2019s inflight WI-FI. I had some work to complete and was able to do so with onboard internet. Thanks again for the great end to end service! I had a great flight back home! \ud83d\ude0d\ud83e\udd73\ud83e\udef6\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d\n\n#greatcustomerexperiences #JAL",

Out of the blue I receive an unclear email that states the flights have changed, the departure time and date are the same but the arrival times (on a direct flight) have changed and the connections are now misaligned leaving me stuck. The website was not functioning properly and so I was forced to call the call centre during the slim daily window in which they operate. This is where the issues started... nobody EVER answers, \n\nUnfortunately due to the fact that I had a meeting I had to abandon my attempt and getting any information after a mere 90 minutes in the call center queue, listening to the same loop of music and the same condescending voice \"All of our agents are busy, please wait for the next available agent or call back later\" - the really galling part is every so often I hear a beep on the line where somebody is there but not answering. \n\nEven though I travel to Japan regularly I will really think long and hard before ever choosing JAL again, they really have let themselves down with their appalling customer service, no callback service, no estimated wait time NOTHING...",

Due to the closure of Russian airspace the flight was slightly longer than usual, but even this 13-hour flight was surprisingly pleasant thanks to Japan Airlines\u2019s incredible service, food and entertainment. I am a regular customer with JAL and never have I been disappointed. The crew were professional, polite and helpful, the food was more delicious than you\u2019d expect from an economy class product on a flight and the selection of entertainment was more than enough to keep you entertained for the flight. Two full meals and two snacks (ice cream and dorayaki - this seems to be standard on Japan Airlines). \nOn the other hand, the seats are quite firm and perhaps a bit uncomfortable to move around in on a 13-hour flight - JAL appears to use the same seats on its longest international flights as well as its shorter domestic flights\u2026Plenty of legroom though and seats are very wide. Recline is also somewhat good.\nI\u2019d definitely recommend Japan Airlines to you if you\u2019re travelling from Europe to Japan. Compared to BA and ANA that I\u2019ve also flown with to Japan, JAL seems to be the best in economy class.",

The call center guy of JAL in North America also has a very negative attitude when checking flights or options for us. He asked me to call WestJet to check and changed flights instead of working himself. However, we are not WetJet's customers, we pay the whole trip money to JAL. The call center guy told me that \"How do I know if I do not try to call WestJet\". After calling him, I did call WestJet but WetJet could not help and asked me to contact JAL again. \nI did fly with my international airlines but it's the first time I had a very negative experience I had with JAL.

        "review_text": "How times, and airlines, have changed. A few years ago, JAL was our favourite international airline.  We are booked on a JAL premium economy return flight from Sydney to Paris in a few weeks which requires a 14-hour overnight layover at the Haneda airport hotel airside.  This was the only connection available.\nWe started to get concerned when we read that due to COVID, Japan was not issuing any tourist visas (unless in a group) or even transit visas.  The Japanese consulate in Australia has confirmed this is the case and as we must pass immigration to get to the airport hotel, 200 metres away, we will be denied entry into Japan.  \nSo, what to do?  Some travellers suggest sleeping in the airport waiting area (some banks of seats have no arms so stretch out they say) however that definitely wasn\u2019t an attractive or an acceptable option. We are way past sleeping on airport benches or floors.  Notwithstanding, we now understand that a new development is airport staff are now shutting down the airport late at night, again due to Covid concerns and kick everyone out \u2013 to where?  Can\u2019t enter Japan, can\u2019t stay at the airport, can\u2019t go back to the plane.\nAs most JAL customers know and despite Japan\u2019s customary politeness and civility, etc.,  the airline\u2019s customer service is practically non-existent, certainly there is no capacity to email the airline.  I waited two hours on the phone only to be addressed by someone who didn\u2019t want to be there and had absolutely no interest in the issues I was trying to resolve. I achieved nothing and was left with a feeling that the airline was happy to keep my flight payments knowing full well that I would be left in \u2018no-man\u2019s land\u2019 at Haneda airport, unable to go anywhere.\nBottom line is that, in my view, JAL\u2019s behaviour has been unconscionable.  The airline hasn\u2019t even had the decency to contact us  (and no doubt all the other transit passengers on the flight) and offer alternatives.  I will cancel my flight and fight the A$600 (for 2 people) cancellation fee that JAL will impose.  It is clear that JAL has little interest in the current unsolvable issue their only flight connection has created for its transit passengers.",

At time of cancellation they told me I'd be receiving a full refund. 4 months later, I'm still waiting on my refund.\n\nWhile writing this I'm 3 hours into waiting on hold on their customer service line so that I can figure out when they're going to return my captive $2000. As far as I can tell, sitting on hold is the only way to get in contact with JAL.\n\nI have and will continue to advise everyone I know to avoid this airline like the plague.\n\n-Andrew Bitzko",

        "review_text": "I took the early morning 8:05 am flight from Bangkok to Tokyo Narita.  I arrived at the airport at around 5:20 am before check in opened at 5:35 am.  I lined up for the First Class check in line based on OneWorld Emerald status eventhough I was booked in Business Class.  The line was not moving as the first passenger in line seemed to have a complicated issue that took a lot of time so one of the Business Class counters took over checking in those in the First Class line.  \n\nI had reserved seat 5A which is a window seat in the first row of Business Class.  On check in, I was told the seat had a problem with the partition between the window seat and the aisle seat and that it could not move up all the way.  As the flight was pretty full and I was pretty sure all the window seats were taken already, I said I was fine with my seat.  Business and First passengers can use the priority lane security entrance on the main floor and did not have to go up one floor to go through security like the other passengers.  I was quickly past security and passport control and in the Sakura Lounge at Suvarnabhumi airport. \n\nInstead of the usual self serve buffet, Sakura Lounge is now on an order system where you go up to staff and order your food items or drinks.  At the meal counter, you could order chicken curry, donburi set, sausage and egg set, salad, corn soup, Japanese gozen or fried chicken, more than enough food and plenty of choices for breakfast.  Service, as usual for JAL, was very efficient.   There is a lot of seating in the lounge and plastic dividers have been placed between seats for Covid-19 protection.  \n\nThe flight boarded on time.  On boarding, I discovered the partition between my seat and seat 5B was completely taped down in the open position so that there was no privacy at all from seat 5B.  I went up to the purser to mention this as it was a different situation than check-in had explained to me.  After checking briefly, the purser came back to me to offer a seat in First Class instead since this flight did have a small first class section with 8 seats and there was a single unoccupied seat.  \n\nBusiness class is configured 2X2X2 and First class is configured 1X2X1.  The First class seat was much more spacious than the business class seat, with neat storage compartments all around the seat and a foot rest that could double as a second seat for a companion to have a join meal in the seat.  The First class seat had beautiful wood trim all around, a very large video screen, and a shelf under the video monitor that can move toward the seat as a large table.  There is also ample storage space under the food rest for a carry on bag. \n\nOn this medium haul flight, the toiletries bag and menu were the same in First and Business class and only the blanket was different with First having a warmer textured blanket.  \n\nService, as always on JAL, was excellent.  Lunch was served during the flight and I selected the Japanese meal with the bento box of various starters, followed by soup, rice and the duo of mains of grilled flatfish miso yuan style and grilled pork saikyo style.   It was delicious, filling and visually extremely appealing. \n\nI have always enjoyed my JAL flights and this one was no exception.  An upgraded super comfortable wide seat, excellent food and service - another great flight experience.",

But now, after flying a round trip with them to Jakarta and back, I wouldn't be very excited to fly them until Japan changes its quarantine rules for tourists: EVERY SINGLE JAL FLIGHT WAS DELAYED both to and from USA and to and from Asia. \nThis isn't really JAL's fault: the Japanese govt isn't allowing JAL to leave a single passenger in Narita overnight, so if even one connecting flight from JFK/ORD/LAX/SFO/SAN/SEA/YVR/DFW is delayed, then ALL of the connections to BKK/CGK/SIN/KUL/MNL/HAN are delayed so that every single passenger gets on their connecting flight. Same thing on the way back to USA. My delays were: SFO-NRT 90 min delay; NRT-CGK 3 hours delay: CGK-NRT not delayed; NRT-SFO 1 hour delay, causing me to miss my connection from SFO to JFK. \nIn addition, the intra-Asia flights on the 787-800 features slanted beds in Business Class (NOT FLAT) which is not competetive with the other airlines-- Garuda, Singapore Air, Malaysia Air, Cathay, ANA. \nLastly, JAL weirdly serves only a tiny snack after take off on the 7 hour flight CGK-NRT, which departs at 06:35AM. 5 hours into the flight the main meal is served. I hadn't eaten anything before the flight because I (like everyone else on the plane, right?) got up at 3AM, got to the airport about 430AM, went through immigration and customs etc... before boarding at 6AM. When were we expected to eat? I wish I'd have known this ahead of time. \nUmmmm also I tried calling JAL's USA number at least 15 times before the trip began and.... busy busy busy busy. Ridiculous. \nPro: Seat and food on in Business class on the 777-300ER for SFO-NRT and return was excellent!",

They EARNED my money with their customer service and amenities.  Thank you JAL. This should be the industry standard.  Finally,  a company that actually cares about their customers.  On my connection to another airline,  they had a rep to personally escort us to the next flight so we wouldn't miss it. Amazing service.  Even if it is more expensive,  it's worth every penny.",

Fully reclined,  it was like lying on a slant board,  my feet almost on the ground.  Uncomfortable to say the least.  Bad for circulation.

I can't tell if it's communication barrier, rudeness, lack of confidence with employees to communicate properly with customers or they just don't care.\n\nPlane, 777 - I don't understand how JAL was rated a 5 star airlines. In all categories, this should be a 1 star airlines. Toothpicks were all around my seat area & my seat area was dirty & uncleaned. JAL prides itself on cleaniness, it's far from it. I will advise that you get your personal Clorox wipes handy. Headphone jack was screwed up. I literally had to use books to support the headphone plugin to watch movies. USB port was non-functional in my seat location. To be honest, once I observed the attitudes & the communication experience with JAL employees, I simply ignored everything around me, including the flight attendants and more focused on getting to my destination - home. Never, will I make a mistake to book with this airline.\n\nFood - it was pathetic, a joke for business class. I watched some YouTube videos before making a reservation & the talk of food & flight experience seems stellar. Be careful about recommendations of those YouTubers.  Wait till you have the real experience, it was awful. \n\nLounge - The Sakura Lounge at Narita Airport was decent, clean & some food options. The meal I ordered was ok. The corn soup was good. I didn't interact much with the lounge staff due to COVID-19 protocols but I did say thank you in Japanese & most responded politely. However, the lounge experience doesn't transfer to the in-flight experience.\n\nOverall, an awful experience for my roundtrip flight.",

However, it does not mean that an airline can create an itinerary that customer absolutely can\u2019t travel and push all responsibilities over to booking agents.\n\nMy family and I booked a flight to travel from JFK to SGN. Japan Airline offers flights from JFK to NRT, then from HND to SGN. We went with JAL instead of ANA because of shorter layover. Less than 24hr before departing, we received a courtesy call telling us that we must cancel this flight and work with our book agent for a different path because of the covid restrictions in Japan. We had asked for assistance since we had contacted JAL in the past, and none of the calls were successful. The average wait time is 3 hrs. There\u2019s no call back options. \n\nOur agent tried to contact JAL, but waiting from 3:30pm to 9:40pm and never got a response. When we arrived at the airport, the staffs completely ignored us and others who are on the same boat. We had to go back to our agent to book a flight for the next day. \n\nIn such challenging period, working together to find a solution is much more effective than denying responsibility. Selling a flight that no one could possibly fly is unethical. A reasonable person would believe in the airline\u2019s arrangements while preparing necessary documents such as proof of negative PCR result in response to the current environment that we are in. It\u2019s the airline responsibility to offer fly itinerary that would take their customers to where they need to be.",

        "review_text": "The flight my husband and I took from Haneda in April were filled with four or five families with kids (infants or teenagers), which was usually a bad sign. Here is a list of the pet peeves we had on this flight journey:\n1.\tHave you checked which seat you are going to occupy properly? : We reserved isle seats for both of us (my husband to be seated in the seat in front of me in the row C, and myself behind him). When we arrived at the seats, my husband noticed that his seat was already occupied by someone else who was seated with his families and had to tell this guy that he was occupying my husband\u2019s seat in error. This \u2018family guy \u2018moved to the window seat and my husband was seated in the designated isle seat. Some people just assume where they are sitting. But there are always some people who reserve certain seats for reasons.\n2.\tMind your kids and their behaviour:  Looking at three seats in D,E,G on the same number row across the isle from my seat C were occupied by a woman with two infants. They were the main cause of the nightmare on the entire journey. Two daughters, who were assumingly 1 and 3 years old ,were either bawling or screaming constantly. The noise got worse with seat tray banging and lamp flickering by the kids and their mother had no intention of controlling their behaviour. They also trashed around their food debris and litters constantly on the floor. Did anyone see the amount of rubbish they produced for the entire flight journey? At one point, I saw the woman changing one of the kids\u2019 nappies on the seat. Another time, she was checking the content of the nappy by pulling down the pants of the daughter\u2019s, while food was being served.  \n3.\tBe considerate to other fellow passengers:  my husband\u2019s sleep was constantly disturbed by a family of five who were seated next to him occupying over two rows of seats, who often kept walking back and forth to get snacks situated at the breakout area. The father figure of the family tried to cross over my husband\u2019s legs while he was asleep. Unfortunately he wasn\u2019t slim enough to squeeze himself out of the narrow space left and knocking off the a bottle of water left in the seat pocket situated at my husband\u2019s seat, hence waking him up with a loud din. \n4.\tOpt out of \u2018Codeshare\u2019 flight:  It seems that the flight we took from HND to LHR was a codeshare flight with BA, though we originally purchased the option with JAL only. So in a way we ended up paying more than these BA passengers would have paid. I personally have never had good experience with codeshare flight with BA and this flight has proved it once again.\n5.\tThe speed of serving airline food: Is it necessary that the passengers simply get fed with airline food in a hurried manner with less than 20 minutes? When we get served with a main meal, a pot of ice cream gets served at the same time. Why ? For someone who has delicate digestive system, consuming ice cream straight after the main meal does cause an issue. But I do like ice cream, and can only indulge myself in this when I do have good appetite. Mostly I don\u2019t especially prior to the flight, so I tend to skip it nowadays. But I really would like JAL to stop feeding passengers like a herd of cattle.\n6.\tThe level of service during the pandemic and post pandemic: I was fortunate enough to fly back to Japan once with JAL during the pandemic outbreak (before the lockdown and more tight restriction on the overseas travelling) and on that flight there were just about 10 passengers on board. We in the economy class were treated almost like VIPs and Cabin attendants were so attentive and even thanked each passenger for choosing JAL to travel. On this codeshare flight back to the LHR, I felt being part of \u2018cattle\u2019 class, having to put up with noise, smells and litters on the entire flight journey.\n\nI am sure there are many reasons or occasions why kids have to accompany their parents on the flight journeys. But when they do, I urge the parents to take care of their kids so as not to cause any nuisance or disturbances to other passengers. I also feel that airlines should manage better seat allocation befitting each flight situation. For instance, families with (small) kids should be seated in \u2018family friendly\u2019 allocated seat location, and other passengers can choose seats away from them if they wish.",

        "type_of_route": "Southeast Asia",
        "review_text": "(Photos of in flight meals and menu, lounge food posted separately) \n\nI transited in Narita to fly to Bangkok on Japan Airlines.  As my incoming flight to Narita was early, I had time to use the First Class Lounge in the main terminal, the only JAL lounge open at Narita.  It did mean a bit of a walk each way as my arriving flight and my departing flight were both in the satellite terminal. \n\nThe lounge has lots of seating and a large eating area on the second floor of the lounge.  Food is now ordered by scanning a QR code at each table and is quickly delivered to your seat.  All the tables have every other seat blocked and the counter seats have plastic dividers between seats for pandemic safety and distancing.  I ordered some salmon fusilli and steamed vegetables and each was delivered to my seat beautifully plated on a huge plate on an even larger platter.  I also ordered some of the trademark made to order sushi from the sushi counter where you can see sushi chefs making sushi and again the sushi plate was delivered on a large platter.  Therefore just three dishes and I was running out of room on my table already.  All of the food was delicious.  \n\nI boarded my flight to Bangkok on schedule.  The flight is operated with a B787-800 Dreamliner and was about half full in business class.  Seats are configured 2X2X2 with seats staggered slightly so window seats have direct aisle access as well.  There is a lot of larger and smaller shelf space on two sides of the window seat so lots of places to put laptop/tablet, phones, glasses, drinks.  The seat converts to a fully flat bed and was comfortable and quite spacious in bed position.  On this flight unlike the flight from Vancouver to Narita also operated with the same kind of plane, the front toilet was not blocked for use by flight and cabin crew so there were 3 toilets available for use by business class passengers.  \n\nThe flight was an evening flight scheduled for 7 hours 25 minutes but in reality about 7 hours long so instead of a full toiletries case as is provided on full long haul flights, a small cloth pouch was provided with the basics \u2013 toothbrush, eye mask, ear plugs and moisture mask (a unique JAL feature where you wear it over your mouth and nose and insert in wet sheets to increase moisture in the air you breathe). \n\nService on the flight was exceptional.  Cabin crew always took time to say a few extra words that created an exceptionally friendly environment.  JAL service is always excellent but on this particular flight, the cabin crew took it up another level yet. \n\nInitially there were some issues with the entertainment system and the system on my seat and the empty seat next to me both did not work.  Cabin crew came by a couple of times to help and in the end restarted the whole system to fixed the issue. \n\nFood was divine on the flight as it was catered out of Japan.  Not only is the food delicious but it is presented in such a beautiful and refined way that your taste buds already won over when the bento box (for appetizers) or dish (for mains) arrives at your seat.  As always, the JAL menu includes a page describing the special coffee that is served in business class on that flight.  This time it was not a favourite as it was a lighter roast with more acidity than I like, but nevertheless it is always interesting to see what special coffee would be served on my JAL flight. \n\nThe flight arrived about 25 minutes early at around 11:08 pm.  I passed through the Thailand Pass checkpoint and immigration and had picked up my checked luggage by 11:48 pm, and was on board the hotel arranged van enroute to the hotel by midnight. \n\nThe application for the Thailand Pass process was a bit tricky as the application website is finicky requiring you to upload photos of your passport, first night Test and Go hotel booking, required travel insurance, vaccination record but with limits on the size of the photo files.  However, once I was able to complete the application and submit it, I received the approval and the issuance of the QR code with my Thailand Pass within hours.  Under the Test and Go system you must book the first night of arrival at an SH+ hotel and stay in your room until you receive your negative PCR test result from your arrival test.  I booked the Sukhothai Bangkok and they were very helpful with information I needed to deal with my Thailand Pass application and testing process.\n\nThe Test and Go program requires you to take hotel provided private transportation from the airport to the hotel.  I was somewhat surprised by the van that Sukhothai Bangkok provided to take me to the hotel as it was a decked out blingy VIP van with changing color lights on the ceiling like a party van.  Nevertheless it got the job done and I arrived safely at the hotel, was quickly taken to a nurse on site from the hospital partner of the hotel to take a swab sample for my arrival PCR test, and was in my hotel room by around 12:30 am \u2013 less than 1 \u00bd hour after I landed. \n\nThe whole process was relatively stress free and quick.  An excellent late evening flight with JAL, very comfortable, well pampered with superb service and delicious food.",

After waiting on hold for over an hour, we got through and the lady on the phone told us we would get a refund in 12 weeks!!!! THIS IS NOT OKAY. THEY CANCELLED AND THEN TELL US WE CANNOT EVEN HAVE OUR MONEY BACK FOR 12 WEEKS!!!! We need our money to book another flight!! Then, after us explaining to her that is not ok and we need the money SOONER, she hung the phone up on us... PATHETIC. ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED. no explanation on the cancellation either... this is ridiculous and i will NEVER fly with them again. they have lost me as a customer as well the people that i am travelling with.",

        "review_text": "One of the worst flight experience. Bought the ticket online directly from their website as free of charge change. Initially we were supposed to fly out of LAX on Feb 25th but they didn\u2019t check us in because one us didn\u2019t have traveler\u2019s insurance not to mention that was not indicated as a requirement to check in when I purchased the tickets and on top of that didn\u2019t even bother notify us of such a requirement prior to the flight . Anyway after spending couple of hours on the phone trying to purchase the insurance we weren\u2019t able to do so because insurance companies cant issue the insurance on the same day of the flight so we had to reschedule the flight for first available and that was for 4 days later. This caused us losing 4 days of our Airbnb and our vacation, extra expenses and inconvenience back and forth to LAX and another $450 for covid test since the test is good only dir 48 hours, not to mention that how rude and inconsiderate their staff are at LAX airport . Anyhow at the end of our trip we decided to extend it for few days but when we went to Manila airport they said our return ticket was not changeable and that we had to purchase another ticket if we wanted to stay longer. I couldn\u2019t even believe that because the round trip ticket was purchased as free of charge change but they said only going to Manila was changeable \u201c category k \u201c and return ticket was not changeable \u201c category q \u201c ! It\u2019s hard to believe that none of this was mentioned on the website when I purchased the ticket and on final confirmation that I received it indicated that ticket was purchased as free of charge on changing and it wasn\u2019t specified that applies to  only for one way! This is by far one of the worst airline experience that we have ever had . It was our first time taking Japan airline and would certainly be the last time . Their plane are clean but the service and food is HORRIBLE! Not even worth it",

        "review_text": "I have been flying Cathay Pacific to Hong Kong the last couple of years due to the pandemic.  However, since Hong Kong has a flight ban in place preventing flights from Canada and preventing anyone who has been in Canada for more than 2 hours in the last 14 days from entering Hong Kong, I flew Japan Airlines to Narita to connect to Bangkok, and then to wait out the 14 days entry ban before flying on to Hong Kong.  \n\nFlying Japan Airlines after Cathay Pacific was quite an upgrade.  The service is much better and the food is also superior. \n\nCheck in opens 3 hours before the flight and I arrived at around 11 am shortly after check in opened.  Check in was already very busy and even in the first class line, there was a bit of a wait for an available check in counter to become available. This may be due to the need to check each person's extensive documents for whatever destination they were travelling to.  As I was not entering Japan, I was not required to comply with Japan's conditions but staff had to check my Thailand pass documents and that took about 5 minutes. \n\nVancouver Airport has reopened the D gates entry since there are now increased flights so it was nice not to have to walk all the way over to the domestic flights entry to go through security and then walk back to the international gates.  Security was a bit slow as there was only one security line open. \n\nJapan Airlines business class passengers have use of the Plaza Premium lounge.  The lounge was not very busy when I entered which was good as I noticed that one section of the lounge which used to have the hot foods station was closed.  All food is now provided in the former coffee bar section with sandwiches in the refrigerated cabinet and a small selection of hot foods on the side like mie goreng and butter chicken.  \n\nBoarding for JAL flight was orderly as usual.  JAL operates a B787-8 on the route with 30 seats in business class split between a front section with 3 rows and 18 seats and a back section with 2 rows and 12 seats in a 2X2X2 configuration.  The seats are staggered so every seat has direct aisle access.  I love the window seat as in addition to the window, it has a large shelf right under the video screen that has enough space to put a small laptop or a tablet, and a narrow shelf along the side of the seat to put my phone and glasses.  \n\nThe seat is the Sky Suite 1 which I like quite a bit as it is quite roomy and enclosed by a head level partition which affords a lot of privacy.  In bed position, the seat has great length so my feet did not even need to reach the shelf section under the video screen that is the last section of the seat in bed position.  Shoulder space is also very good as both armrests lower down flat with the seat in bed position although the aisle side armrest is quite hard and not comfortable to rest my arm or elbow on in bed position.  \n\nThere is plenty of storage space as in addition to the overhead bin, there is a small shelf behind my seat for miscellaneous items and space for a carry on bag under the video screen.  The tray table pops out from the side of the seat and can swing out so I can exit my seat without putting the table away, though requiring a bit of manoeuvring on my part to do so. \n\n12 out of the seats in the front section were occupied so it was not too full.  The seat beside mine was empty so I could keep the partition between my window seat and the aisle seat down unless I wanted more privacy.   \n\nWhen it is time to sleep, cabin crew will help put out the bedding which consists of a thick mattress pad and a light blanket.  The mattress bed completely eliminates any feel of the ridges in the seat where it folds in seat position and makes for a very comfortable bed to sleep on. \n\nThis flight had the Magic 6 entertainment system which is quite an upgrade from earlier JAL in flight entertainment systems with a lot more choices of movies in multiple languages from multiple countries. \n\nService on the flight is as always with JAL, superb.  Very attentive but discreet and refined.  Everything is done meticulously - even a glass is carefully placed with the JAL logo facing you.  Toilets are always neat and tidy as the cabin crew are constantly cleaning it after passenger use. \n\nFood is a highlight on JAL flights.  I almost always choose the Japanese meal for the appetizer bento box with multiple sections featuring a variety of delectable and beautiful bite sized eats.  You start enjoying your meal even before you taste it as the presentation is always so beautiful and again meticulous.  Meal service consists of lunch/dinner served after take off and then a snack served 2 hours before landing.  One unique feature of the JAL in flight menu is the page describing the special coffee of the month for the flight.  JAL features different specially selected coffees and gives a description with tasting notes as one would normally find with wines.\n\nThroughout the flight, cabin crew were constantly going through the cabin looking for any passenger service needs and as soon as I finish a drink or a snack cup noodle, cabin crew would very soon after notice this and remove the item. \n\nThe flight arrived more than an hour early.  Passengers are requested to remain in their seat after the plane reached its gate as Japan has specific procedures to deboard international transit passengers first before then deboarding passengers who are entering Japan and must go through the arrival Covid-19 test procedure. \n\nWe lost about half an hour after disembarking from the plane as they had to wait for all transit passengers to be accounted for and they kept counting and counting and could not get to the correct count.  Eventually, all the lined up transit passengers were allowed to exit the gate and head to the international transit station.  Once there, passing through security was quick and then I was into the departures section and able to go to the lounge to await my connecting flight to Bangkok. \n\nThe JAL flight is very enjoyable, with the service and food being particular highlights.  \n\nArrival and transit procedures at Narita airport are orderly and generally very quick and efficient, as the Japanese are famous for.  If you have to fly somewhere that JAL can fly to, you should definitely consider JAL for your flight and you do not need to worry about transiting and connecting at Narita airport.",

In the air I again asked about it and begged to be given a seat on the next connection snd was told not to worry, that someone on the ground would assist. We landed and it was about 45 minutes before the next flight and I was ignored by all of the gate agents and ground agents for so long that by the time someone finally looked at what I needed the next connecting flight had already left. During the time I could have been making that connection I was helplessly watching the ground agents laugh with each other instead of helping me. The next available flight they could book me on was 4 hours later. All of my friends flying a different airline (ANA) made it home without any of these issues. I will never fly JAL again.",

The ground staff, Natsuko K, was impatient and rude in handling the process.  She rejected both of my'-' Covid tests without proper verifications.  One of the tests was a NAAT test similar to PCR test, taken at Albertson, and the other was a PCR test as well from a recognized clinic here in DFW except that part of the standard form they used was hand-written. I even had the medical prof on the call for Natsuko to verify the test result but she refused.  I felt being discriminated against for no reason.  I was refused boarding and had to go take another Covid test.  That's ridiculous!!  According the Med professional at the third clinic, those two earlier tests were already valid PCR tests!!\nLater, I called my embassy who told me those 2 tests should be accepted as well.\n\nApparently she did not seem to be competent for the job even though she claimed to be a ground manager.  I believe she reports to Tomoko T.  JAL:  You need to review and take adequate action to prevent her from tarnishing the reputation of Japan Air. \n\nI actually called JAL support few times days before my departure to get more details about the Covid test requirements but they have no clue !!  Later I decided to take the test twice just to be sure but they were both turned down for no reason!!",

Because the Covid-19 PRR test views were one hour late, I couldn\u2019t board the plane. Call the agent and she gave me one that can\u2019t be used.  No one answered the phone number, and no one answered the call on her Japan Airlines phone in our company. She said she could not help me change the ticket and needed Japan Airlines to help change the ticket. Now if you mind canceling this ticket, buy it again, I listen.  In response to her opinion, she bought a round-trip ticket on October 8. She said that her company is very busy and it takes a few weeks to refund me the ticket on October 6. In mid-November, I got the money for a ticket refund.  It\u2019s not a round-trip ticket. I called them and it\u2019s hard to answer the phone. Today I answered the phone and said that their company needs to cancel the fee, 71US dollars. The rest of the money is deducted by the Japanese company. They asked me to contact Japan Airlines. I called  They told Japan Airlines that they would not deduct customer cancellation fees during the epidemic. They asked me to contact the agency, and I contacted the agency. The agency said they could send me an email to prove that they wanted me to call Japan Airlines to not deduct the deduction during the epidemic.  For customers\u2019 cancellation fees, I called Japan Airlines to ask Japan Airlines that they changed their terms and said that they had deducted the cancellation fees.  Now they are all playing games with Covid-19, the final victim is our consumption! You not law asking them cancellation fee?what?  I will never use Japan Airlines again. I hope Gotogate will close down soon. I also hope that the government can rectify this black-hearted travel agency!!",

Both of them took great care and hospitality throughout the flight. \n\nMs Nagayama on JL36 SIN-HND, 24 Dec also provided great service and hospitality throughout my flight on the Business Class.",

They Li said we couldn\u2019t fly because our certificates were not complete. They were. Issued by a top level PCR testing lab in Tokyo, with English translation. Fully certified. \n\nThey lied and said HK and Cathay would not allow us to fly to HK. After about an hour of mounting tension and stress,  I called Cathay myself to find out why they blocked us. Cathay rep said we were all clear to fly to HK and into Sydney. \n\nI gave the phone to JAL supervisor. They ran around with radios etc. boarding time Was by then only 40 minutes away. Luggage still at the counter. \n\nThis had now been over two hours at the JAL counter with 2 hungry kids and we were wiped out after 5 months of planning and packing for a complete international move, COVID complications, quarantine, vaccines, testing,  relocation planning etc etc. \n\nThis was the only cluster we had after months of meticulous planning with all contingencies forecast, except gross incompetence with an Airline check in. \n\nThey finally emerged waving four papers we could sign and board, now 15 minutes before take off. We quickly signed including 2 kids. We were totally stressed as our onward plans had multiple things set up including : vehicle deliveries, 3 lots of accommodations, visiting plans for aged sick family in care, all teetering on our correct arrival time. \n\nIt turns out the papers were to indemnify JAL from us suing them for \u2018damages, losses etc.  I quickly read the paper as we were leaving.  Disgusted but too stressed and worried about getting on the plane, we left. \n\nI wrote my concerns the JAL, got a polite reply and guarantee they would investigate. They did, but the staff obviously lied again and no remedy offered. The report sent had clear omissions and false statements. We we\u2019re deprived of the use of the lounge, stressed to the point if melt down, yet these clown think it\u2019s fine. \n\nI love japan and can say this was the first time in years of living in Japan, that Japanese people lied and lied and lied again to me.

JAL cancelled my inbound flights, less than 10days before I'm supposed to depart, with no alternative flights provided (while I clearly see other flights available online when I search). It's almost like they want you to cancel and get a refund so you're forced to purchase the more expensive fares. \n\nThe issue is still not resolved, but I ended up booking a one-way return which was more expensive than my entire ticket. I made sure I booked directly with the airline and NOT JAL. It takes at least 2hours to get to someone on the phone, and I made 3 phone calls to them. This isn't the first time I booked through an online travel agency with cancelled flights but this is the first time I've had this issue. \n\nBook this airline at your own risk. If something goes wrong, you're on your own and you're basically throwing your money away unless you buy the refundable fares. Good luck. I'd stay away from this airline if I were you.",

However, when my baggage finally arrived, we had missed the last shuttle to get to my flight in Narita.  \n\nThe representative then worked on an alternate method to get me to Narita, and 5 minutes later, they paid a taxi to drive me there (a 30,000 yen trip!), and I was able to catch my connecting flight instead of staying a night in Tokyo.   They had also informed American Airlines of my delay, and I was expedited through the American Airlines ticket counter to make it to my flight as it was boarding.\n\nThe lengths JAL went to ensure I got to my next flight was above and beyond what I would have ever expected, and I know for sure I will never receive this level of customer service ever again.

I will now have to wait another 6 weeks to get my money back from them and I've had to book my flight last minute with a totally different company. Do NOT book with Japan airlines. They can't be trusted to get you to your destination no matter how far in advance you book. They are less than helpful over the phone making the whole experience a complete nightmare.",

My understanding when I booked was that there would be no cancellation or change fees if the flights were cancelled due to COVID restrictions. I have tried unsuccessfully to get the rest of my refund via their Customer Service, so I can see that I will need to take my complaint higher.\nOther airlines have provided a full refund, so I really hope JAL will do the right thing. \nI had a put a travel date to submit this review BUT we have not yet travelled with JAL.

        "review_text": "Having flown business or combined first/business on (alphabetically) American, British Airways, Air Canada, Cathay Pacific, KLM, Korean Air, Malaysian Airlines, Singapore, Thai Airlines, and United, I can authoritatively state that Japan Airlines is the absolute worst.\n\nIn chronological order, here are the problems I experienced on one or both legs of my trans-pacific journey from North America via Tokyo to Vietnam in the first class cabin:\n(1) The lie-flat seats have huge privacy barriers so if you get stuck with an aisle seat there's no way you can see out of any of the windows as the flight attendants roll up all the visual barriers. If you're inclined to feel uncomfortable in a windowless space, beware.\n\n(2) I was given no choice of dinner menu items, as the flight attendants let their preferred passengers (a group of about 15 suited businessmen traveling together as a group) choose their menu selections first. There were snack items, but no palatable main entree items. (no slice of chicken or beef or a pasta dish; nothing but grotesque looking un-nameable seafood-looking items that, I presume, are popular among native-born Japanese. \n\n(3) The in-flight entertainment system (for movies etc.) is an absolute joke. Think Windows 2000 (or similar) operating system with lots of DOS-type prompts... seriously and truthfully, the system used on these two aircraft dated back to the year 2003.\n\n(4) The overall experience inside a JAL aircraft is dreary, dreary, dreary. It's a good thing that, other than wanting a nice filling hot meal, I wanted to sleep, and got lots of that. Oh, and there was a box of chocolates set out for everyone (in First Class) on a snack tray by the toilets, and in that box of chocolates, at least 3 or 4 in the box were actually chocolate, as opposed to chocolate-covered mystery creme. In the name of saving on costs, apparently no corner was cut.\n\n(5) On a happier note, the executive lounge inside Narita Airport is a nice place to wait for your connecting flight. Luckily, though all six (count 'em, six!) showers were occupied when I arrived, I was able to \"book\" a shower for 30 minutes later, enough time to have myself a shower and a shave before rushing out to board my next flight.\n(6) JAL seems to thrive on its long-standing relationships with many very large Japanese companies who send their salaried employees lucky enough to travel overseas, in Business or First class.",

        "type_of_route": "International",
        "review_text": "I connected at Narita airport for JL18 from Narita to Vancouver.  After passing through security for international transits, I had about a 3 hour layover before my flight and so made my way to the only Japan Airlines lounge that is open at Narita \u2013 the First Class Lounge on level 4 of the main terminal building of Terminal 2 \u2013 now open for both First Class and Business Class passengers.  On the way, I noticed that the airport was noticeably empty of travellers and even at the duty free shops that are usually full of Chinese tourists lining up for purchases, there were few customers.  \n\nNormally the First Class lounge entrance is on the 3rd floor and you take the elevator inside the entrance to go up to the 4th floor.  Now, you take the escalator outside the closed entrance to the First Class Lounge on the 3rd floor, go up the escalator to the 4th floor and enter the First Class Lounge there.  From the 4th floor, you can take the elevator inside the lounge to go back down to the 3rd floor where the shower rooms are located.  The dining area is on the 4th floor.  When I was there from around 3:45 pm to around 6 pm, it was not very busy, there were plenty of seats with plastic partitions between counter seats and open tables designated with signs for one person or a couple only.  There were plenty of staff to assist and as always, service is superb, attentive, low-keyed.  The coffee and soft drinks machines are still self serve, but all of the food is now served to you by staff and not self serve.  This applies even to the special KitKat bars for coffee that used to be self serve in jars but are now neatly displayed one to a dish in a glass cabinet and must be served to you by staff behind the counter.  There were still quite a few items available made to order, including sushi from the made to order sushi counter, but I thought the food selection was noticeably smaller and more snack like rather than meal like.  The only meal like items were the trademark Japan Airlines beef curry (which is traditionally available in both the Sakura business class lounge and the First Class Lounge), the Japanese style breakfast (curious offering for late afternoon) and the ramen.   Hot snacks to order included soup dumplings (Chinese xiao long bao) and Sichuan style mapo tofu.  The coffee served in the lounge is the same special coffee lines that JAL sources from Japanese coffee specialist Mi Cafeto for first and business class on its flights \u2013 always very enjoyable and flavourful.  \n\nAfter grabbing a quick bite, I then went to the seating area of the lounge.  The seating area has lots of individual sofa type seats and some counter type seats at the large windows which provide a good view of the adjacent gates and the runway beyond.  Surprisingly, the massage chairs in this section of the lounge are still available for use.  I did not have enough time to use them this trip as they typically have a cycle that runs about 10 or 15 minutes, but I have used them in past visits to JAL lounges and think they are quite good and enjoyable as far as massage chairs go. \n\nI arrived at the gate for my flight before boarding time and counted 70+ people in the gate area \u2013 indicating a relatively full flight during pandemic travel restricted times since JAL uses a B787-800 with 186 seats.  Uncharacteristically for JAL, boarding was actually delayed for about 15 minutes \u2013 the announcement indicated \u201cairport issues\u201d.  Boarding was by rows and as expected from the very orderly Japanese people, passengers only lined up when their rows were called.  There was pre-boarding for wheelchairs and families with young children requiring assistance following which was boarding for First Class/JAL Diamond/OneWorld Emerald, and then Business Class.  There is no First Class cabin on JL18, and I was the only person in the JAL Diamond/OneWorld Emerald line. \n \nThe flight is operated with a B787-800 aircraft with only business class and economy seating.  In business class, the plane is equipped with the JAL Sky Suite in a 2X2X2 configuration.  There are 30 seats in business class and about 7 or 8 passengers in business class on my flight.  The Sky Suite is a great seat with direct aisle access from every seat, fully horizontal flatbed option and an enclosure around your seat that is a little above seated head level for a great deal of privacy.  I had a window seat at 1K and the seat beside me was empty as well the two rows of seats behind me so there was plenty of buffer between me and other passengers.  With direct aisle access, the window seats on the flight are a great choice as in addition to greater privacy, you can also take advantage of the extra large windows on a B787 Dreamliner.  Note that the Sky Suite window seats, aisle seats and center section seats differ slightly from each other in terms of little storage areas and counters.  The window seats are particularly good as they have more ledges and counters around the seat to put things on and a storage tray behind the seat headrest for smaller items.  There is also a storage shelf under the video screen and room for a carry on bag under the shelf.  On boarding, there was a large pillow, toiletries bag, slippers, noise cancelling headphones, light blanket and bottle water already placed at the seat.  Surprisingly, for cleaning obsessed pandemic times, there was also an in flight magazine, a duty free shopping magazine and an entertainment program magazine at the seat, and actual printed menus were handed out before meal service.  \n\nPushback was similarly 15 minutes delayed but with a short flight time of 8 hrs 20 minutes, we were scheduled to arrive early and in fact did land very early at 9:51 am, over an hour earlier than scheduled.  Shortly after take off, cabin attendants came around to take drinks and meal orders.  Japan Airlines seem to have made minimal changes to in flight dining service \u2013 the same number of meals in flight, the same choices of food and number of courses are offered, for a Japanese style meal \u2013 tray with bento box with 5 sections for different appetizers, followed by a tray with the main course with rice, miso soup and pickles, followed by a third tray with coffee and dessert.  The only difference is that all the containers now have covers that the passengers must remove themselves.  Flight attendants wore masks at all times and wore gloves during meal service.  I opted for and pre-ordered the Japanese meal for dinner and as always, it was beautifully presented and if anything, even more delicious than on prior flights with JAL.  This might be due to the fewer flights that JAL is now operating and it apparently switching to serving what appears to be the same menu on all its flights for similar meals.  I checked on JAL\u2019s website the menu for JAL\u2019s flights on the same day for other US and European destinations and they appear to all feature the same menu items. \n\nMeal service was completed about 2 \u00bd hours after take off.  Cabin attendants then offered to put out the new Airweave foam mattresses that JAL now offers on some long haul overnight flights.  This was my first experience with the Airweave foam mattress, it is made of quite thick foam of maybe an inch, and I thought it greatly enhanced the comfort of the seat when in flatbed position.  \n\nThe Sky Suite seat has a fairly large video screen \u2013 JAL website indicates 23 in.  But it is not a touch screen and while there is a separate hand held remote unit, the interaction between the control and the screen is awkward, they do not mirror each other.  In flight entertainment for English speakers has never been a strength of JAL and so while there was an adequate selection of a few newer movies, more older movies and then a handful of movies and TV programs with English subtitles, many of the offerings were in Japanese only or subtitled in Japanese only. \n\nAbout 1 \u00bd hr before landing, the second meal service was offered \u2013 a Japanese or Western breakfast.  I tried the Western breakfast, described as a sweet potato Spanish omelette but it in fact came with sausages too.  Not outstanding like the Japanese dinner first meal, but still good. \n\nPrior to landing, the head cabin attendant came by to thank me for flying with JAL.  Throughout the flight, service was excellent and the cabin crew did an excellent job of keeping the toilets clean. \n\nArriving at Vancouver International Airport, there was the usual pass through the machines to complete your arrival declaration and then all passengers joined one line for the customs and immigration officers.  The line was quite long but moved quickly.  I had downloaded the ArriveCAN app and filled in and submitted my quarantine plan and health declaration prior to my flight and so passed through very quickly when it was my turn.  A bit confusingly, the customs and immigration officer gave me one handout about quarantine and then as I passed those counters and walked towards the luggage carousels, the area was cordoned off in a way that you had to pass an individual, who I believe said he was with Health Canada, who then gave you a different handout about the quarantine.  There was also information which you can access on website links through the ArriveCAN app but the information from the various sources differed.  For example, the two handouts indicated I would receive calls from two 1-800 type numbers and that I must answer those calls, but then the links through the ArriveCAN app refers to a third and different number. \n\nOverall, a very pleasant travel experience with JAL during difficult times for travel.  No diminution of in flight service, enhanced sleep product and excellent meals.",

As a retired Senior with plenty of time on my hands, this didn't present as an insurmountable problem.  Not having passed through Narita for 13-years and Haneda being a first for me, by contrast, I actually looked forward to crossing Tokyo.\nThe transfer turned out to be quite painless; within 30-mins of arrival at Narita, I had cleared Immigration and Customs and had proceeded downstairs to the JR Station to catch the Narita Express for the 70-min journey into Central Tokyo.  After changing trains onto the Keikyu Line at Shinagwa, the overall transfer to Haneda Airport from Narita took about  90-mins overall, with about 90-mins to spare before departure to Sapporo.\nSurprisingly for an internal flight, the Haneda > Sapporo leg was operated by a wide-bodied Airbus A350-941  with a 3-3-3 seating configuration in Economy and this January afternoon flight wasn't particularly busy.  I had selected a seat at the rear of the plane (Row 50) in order to take photos of the snow-covered landscape coming into Sapporo (unobscured by aircraft wings) and the rearmost cabin was virtually empty.  Leaving the rain behind in Tokyo, the weather was perfect throughout the flight and coming into Sapporo with the sun low in the sky, close to setting (at 3:00pm in the afternoon!), was picture perfect.\nNo drawbacks ... instead, a most memorable internal flight!",

        "review_text": "Japan airlines (JAL) is one the most greedy and dishonest airlines I have ever dealt with and I have dealt with a lot of airlines in my life. They do any tactic and tricks to get away with their obligations. We bought our tickets through a travel agency (return tickets from Canada to India) at the beginning of COVID-19 crisis and at that time there was no talk of pandemic and lockdowns or even flight cancellations. However, during our trip countries locked down and flights cancelled, and many people had to forget about their flights or ask for refunds. We contacted JAL and they said we cancelled your original return flight, so we asked to reschedule our flights for later dates. Since JAL changed our flights dates, travel agency did not assume any responsibility afterward and we had to deal with JAL directly. After a few weeks we called to make sure our flights are set, but JAL said, sorry this flight is cancelled too and either you have to reschedule or cancel your flights. At that point we had to get back to our country, Canada and had no choice but to get the repatriate flights through government and cancel our JAL ticket. So we requested a refund and now they say since you bought your ticket through a travel agent we can\u2019t issue a refund to you and when contacted our travel agent they said, as soon as JAL changed your flight dates they took over and we have no control over your tickets. We contacted JAL again, at first they agreed that they have control over our tickets however in a subsequent email they sent this: \u201cDear Valued Customer, Thank you for submitting your refund form to Japan Airlines. Upon review, we regret to inform you that your ticket does not qualify due to the reason below:   *  Ticket is issued by a third party travel agency\u201d\nBasically, JAL doesn\u2019t want to honor our tickets and refund us and look for any excuse not to do so. This is the worst and most irresponsible airline I have ever dealt with. \nIf you value your money and sanity, do not fly with Japan airlines, they easily ignore you and look for any excuse to rip you off !!!!!!!!!",

Travelling with a group on 26th January, 2020 and on my birthday eve I initially enquired from the ground staff if I could carry a small cake inside the aircraft as I wanted to have something sweet as this time I could not a cake. They agreed to it. Finally I dropped the idea as i knew it will be difficult to keep  it inside. While just about to board the aircraft I saw the crew dressed in ethnic wear as it was India\u2019s Republic Day. This small gesture from their end will remain with me forever. My inflight experience was equally good as the crew was very supportive and attentive to my requests. I was booked in the economy class and the leg room was good enough to stretch my legs. While returning from Tokyo to New Delhi on JL 749 on 31st January, 2020 I was given a middle seat to which I was not comfortable sitting. While requesting to change the same for an aisle seat or a window seat they happily gave me 2 Premium Economy seats so that one of the group members can also sit with me. I was impressed with the presence of mind and the eye for detail which their staff had. Whenever I travel to Japan it shall be through JAL.\nOne suggestion : If a passenger is travelling with you on his birthday/ anniversary the staff should make it a point to wish the passenger as this will earn you more customers in the future.",

End of March during the pandemic, we as a family decided to fly back from Indonesia to US since the choices of flights were narrowing down because of the traveling ban from several countries. Thankfully JAL still had some flights to US with reasonable price even though we paid almost twice the price that we used to pay. The flight from Jakarta to Tokyo still had decent amount of passengers meanwhile Tokyo to Boston only had like less than 20 passengers. But man, their crews were still professional. Thank you so much, JAL for bringing us back to our home in the middle of this chaos.",

My flight was rescheduled a day earlier and my connection flight forced me to stay in Japan airport for 2.5 days, and because of COVID, I couldn't get pass through the immigration, and had to stay in the airport, without any restaurant opened!\n\nTried to call the agent and waited for hours for 3 days straight with no avail. I called JAL and they promised to help me contact the agent. With JAL's help, I could get the agent to contact me. They sent me an email saying that the flights I wanted was full, and I need to get an upgrade to business class costing USD5000/person (10,000 for 2). SHOCKING! I then called JAL's customer service to check, and though they mentioned that it is customary for them to only reschedule flight through the agent that we booked in, they would like to help and made an exception. They  rescheduled me to a flight I needed.\n\nTheir in flight crews were really attentive.They came over n translated to us every single time because all passengers are mostly Japanese (at this time, nobody really travels to Japan except their own citizens).During our final flight to Seattle (JL 068), though there were only 9 of us, they were still excellent. They made us origami with our names, and said we could choose whichever seats, extend our seats and relax. JAL, YOU're the best!",

Relaxing, too, to know the rhythm and cadence f JAL service. No surprises, nothing unexpected. Just the regular rhythm of good, by-the-book service.\n\nArrival was fast. Small airport.

The infotainment screen was comprehensive and kept me entertained for 13 hours! The food was a real highlight whereby they provide information on the chefs who created all the individual dishes, which is a beautiful touch.  The food was generous,  original and very tasty.  The drinks that were offered were both non and alcoholic in nature,  which was great.  They also offered snacks throughout the whole flight,  which in over 200+ flights,  I have never experienced.  However,  for me,  it was the incredibly profitable customer service that I experienced is the true beauty of flight.  Well done Japan Airlines- my greatest flight experience ever!

Also like ANA a lot but decided to give JAL a go this time as they advertised their awards for Economy Class seats in addition to having a 2-3-2 split on their 767. Not often do you get a 2 seat configuration in cattle class anymore. \n\nEveryone we dealt with was fantastic. The seat lived up to our expectations and was miles more comfortable  than AC.  The cabin was kept spotlessly clean. The service was very quick and attentive. The meals, we thought, were excellent. Washrooms always clean. And available snacks and drinks replenished frequently.\n\nThough we waited on hold for 1.25 hours to connect with an agent to rebook our seats back to Canada, the agent was exceedingly helpful and did everything we asked of her and was super friendly about it. \n\nWe often travel to Japan, usually with ANA to acquire Star Alliance points. Now will choose JAL over ANA, if available and not overly expensive as the seats were comfortable and there was a lot of space around our seat.\n\nThanks!",

You guys did not have the decency to honour a commitment to us your customers in that flight......\nAnd by the way, your app sucks big time as well because it is only in japanese and you are supposed to be an international carrier!!!\nJAL as an airline has quite a bit to learn about customer care.

I usually choose aircraft with twin seats when I fly with my wife and 2 kids so we can sit two by two.  I don't like triple seats because that means I will be the odd one out sitting next to a stranger while my wife sit together with our 2 kids.  \n\nOn this trip from Singapore to Vancouver, I was travelling with my son so it was only two of us.  Airlines use B777, B787 or A350 on long-haul flights which are normally configured in 3-3-3 or 3-4-3 seating in Economy Class.  Since I don't like sitting in triple seats when there are only two of us, I chose JAL because it is the only airline that configures its B777 and B787 with twin seats.  On the Singapore-Tokyo sector, JAL uses B777-200 configured in 2-4-3 seating with increased seat pitch in their Sky Wider cabin.  And on the Tokyo-Vancouver sector, JAL uses B787-8 with eight abreast 2-4-2 seating.  This means on both sectors my son and I could sit in twin seats by ourselves.\n\nThe seating was the most important factor to me.  Next was the service.  JAL always offers excellent service.  Even the food is special.  They have special Japanese meals such as eel rice and Mos burgers prepared by their flight kitchens in Tokyo.\n\nI chose JAL even though the fare was a few hundred dollars more than other airlines.  To me, comfort is more important than the cost.  I will definitely choose JAL again.",

I will only fly JAL if my destination is where they fly. The North American airlines could learn a lot from them with respect to customer service. From booking to check in to flight experience, they are beyond exceptional. They have extra leg room in economy, they offer incredible food constantly throughout flight with real silverware. Imagine that! They provide alcoholic beverages in their pricing as well. The plane is immaculate and the bathrooms are well maintained throughout the long flight and are larger than a shoebox. The flight attendants are overly polite and helpful and don\u2019t yell into the intercom just so they can hear themselves talk. They only come on for 1-2 announcements and with very gentle voices.  They don\u2019t flip the lights on in the middle of the night-  they slowly bring them on. The pilots did not even speak on our first flight  so the plane was very quiet and we had some restful sleep en route. The airline is extremely on time - they depart as scheduled - and on our return flight we departed and ended up on tarmac about 30 mins due to lightning and pilot came on and apologized and said \u201cwe promise to do what we can once in air to keep you on time\u201d and they did - we arrived 30 mins earlier than scheduled. They provide pillows, blankets, excellent movie entertainment and headsets. This is how an airline should be!",

The food is served in dishes, not cardboard, to be eaten with real metal knife, fork and spoon. You will find no plastic sporks here. While I am not a fan of their red house wine, I did enjoy their sake and Japanese beers. Special meal needs are welcome. Just let them know food preferences when you book. \nIn respect to their planes, seating, service and cleanliness, the rest of the flight experience was head and shoulders above the no-frills service which we have been made to tolerate with North American carriers.",

My memories from those flights were great.. the seats were comfortable, the service impeccable, and the food so memorable. It made flying long distances more bearable and I have recommended the airlines at every opportunity. I didn't get the chance to fly it again until recently and was dismayed to find that the standard had fallen.\n\nI booked four flights - Hawaii to Japan to Singapore, and on the way back Singapore to Japan to Hawaii. Regretted it after the first flight... The seats were small and uncomfortable. The service was still excellent but they don't offer you a choice of meals anymore. We were only provided one option - hopefully you like the meal of the day!",

We didn't really expect them to do so because we've heard that passengers on other airlines have been having issues getting refunds on their flights to South Korea, and South Korea currently has many more cases of COVID than Japan. \n\nWe flew with JAL before and liked the trip very much.

To speed things along they presented a picture card of the main course (chicken/pork) in a few languages so you simply pointed to what you wanted.  For desert they served little cups of Haagen-Dazs ice cream.  Because it was a 7 hour flight, prior to landing we had a fluffy breakfast bun and choice of beverage.

It was almost impossible talking to a live person, and once you did get someone on the phone, i felt like we got the runaround. Our flight was on 'American Airlines operated by Japan Airlines.' We first called American Airlines and got to talk to someone immediately. They informed us that any changes had to be made thru JAL. We called JAL, and after waiting for about 45min, they told us to call AA. But wait, there's more...\nAfter 7 days in Japan with 8 of us traveling, JAL counter could only check in 4 of us! What?! Why?..we ask. They have this unapologetic smirk on their face and say we should call American Airlines. Are you kidding me. We call and AA airliens says they have nothing to do we ticketing. JAL counter then tells us there's nothing they can do and we should call our travel agent. Its probably 1am back home...we can't call our agent. JAL counter attendants just stand there and don't try to help at all while we franticly look for local travel agent info. We are in Japan mind you...and can't even call the local agency office. I go back to one of the many JAL staff standing around and beg her to at least help us call an agency contact on Japan. After minutes of dumbfounded contemplation, she gestures to an agent standing at the counter...thank God, because we feel that woman bent over backwards to help us...and she did! She got on the phone and called the number i had for the local agency, and after 15+ minutes on the phone, told us everything was ok.\nBack to the others...there was one agent that 'helped' us initially...she was rude, condescending and everything but helpful. If it werent for the last two ladies who helped us, and the only interaction I got was from this first counterperson, i would never fly Japan Airlines again. How could an airlines ever employ such standoffish unhelpful personnel...",

In others hand, they served good food, Chinese siomay, Italian chicken wrap (with caesars dressing), Japanese Soba, Japanese rice with beef stew. Attractive automatic beer machine, wine & sake bar, coffee and excellent tea corners, kids menu include juice and desserts is available. \nSakura lounge is separated two stores, 2nd floor is for dining and 1st floor is lounge also bathroom in 1st floor. Will you take a shower before flying 8 hours long haul ?\n\nBut lounge is not access to boarding gate, so please enjoy yourself but don\u2019t forget the boarding time.\n\nI fly with JL729, for business class they offer the JAL comfortable pajamas like cardigan with elegant soft green, a pouch of eye mask, moisture mask, ears plug, tooth brush.\n\nAbout the in-flight meals, it\u2019s call BEDD cuisine by Jun Kurogi\nI choose Japanese meals, it\u2019s 3 course meals start from appetizer menu is \u201cYuba\u201d & crabmeat with wasabi flavored soy starchy sauce, Tuna sashimi, poached potherb mustard. Garland chrysanthemum & mushroom in Japanese broth with salmon roe, simmered chicken & vegetables, bechamel sauce & caviar, grilled shrimp with aromatic vegetable sauce. Japanese omelet vinegared turnip wrapped with salmon. \nThere is lots for appetizer right ? serve in a overcute bento box. The chopstick stand is red Japanese Crane origami but its plastic, you may bring it but ask the permission with the crew. \n\nFor main course, it\u2019s Dainomono : Marinated chicken with tar tar sauce and yellow tail teriyaki and they mention 503 kcal and served with Japanese famous steamed rice, miso soup and Japanese pickles.\n\nAnd of course even I am full but it\u2019s always have a room for desserts, Black sesame pudding served as dessert and hot tea.\n\nAll time served if you still hungry, instant noodles, peanuts, chocolate in the pantry.\n\nOne hour before landed the crew served ice cream or Chinese dumpling, I choose Haagen Dazs Ice cream.\n\nIn-flight entertainment is not updated but so far not lousy at all, funny Thai movie, box office movie is available.\n\nThe business class chair is reclining flat and comfy blanket is available. \n\nThe toilet amenities is awesome, the toner and lotion is Shiseido which is Japanese famous branded lotion, but the toilet size is same with others toilets. \n\nOverall, fly with JAL is experience, great service and thank you for the ground crew and cabin crew.",

Out of the wine selections on the menu they didn't have half available (I ended up getting my third choice). Movies have very limited selection in English and you cant remove subtitles.  No pyjamas for overnight flight (you get a top but no bottoms??).  Seats do go flat but are not as big or as comfortable as some other premium airlines.\n\nIt wasn't a disaster but for business class they can to do better.\n\nThey lounge is awesome though, classy and great food and drinks.",

Seats were reasonably spaced for coach.  \nService was pleasant, the dinner was quite good, and bathrooms were kept clean.   The second meal which was billed as a taste of N.Y. from Dean and Deluca was poor.  \nIndividual screens played a variety of movies, but many of the same features were being shown both in early January and early February.",

        "review_text": "My husband and I were flying through Japan Airlines on January 11th-12th when the Taal volcano erupted and all airports in the Philippines were shut down. JAL flew to the Philippines and the captain flew back to Japan after learning that NAIA was closed. When we returned to Japan, we had to go through immigration, collect our luggages and had to check in to a hotel. The first night was covered, however, we had to pay the extra night that we had to stay. I understand that this was mother nature and there is nothing we can do. The experience would not have been that horrible if JAL actually kept us updated about our flight. When we went to our hotel, JAL provided us with a sheet of paper with instructions on how to call for any updates. Mind you, there were approximately 100 other passengers on the same flight as us at this hotel. When we called the numbers that were provided to us, it was ALL in Japanese. We had to ask the employees at the hotel to translate for us. We waited for about an hour to finally speak with someone. When I spoke with the representative at JAL, she said to check the website for any updates. The website they provided us was in Japanese!! At this point, I was so frustrated. We literally felt stranded in Japan not knowing if we would fly today, tomorrow, next week or at all. It is so difficult to communicate with almost everyone that we spoke with at JAL and no one was able to give any answers to when we would be able to fly to our destination. The website, nor the phone number that was provided were of no assistance. Expedia finally assisted with setting us up with Philippine airlines. It is disheartening to fly with an airline company and you feel so helpless because of the lack of communication and unsure of when you are actually going to reach your destination. We have been flying for almost 24 hours when this occurred. When we were going to Narita to catch the flight with Philippine airlines, we had to walk to the shuttle bus area that was 10 minutes away at 4am. The hotel was an hour away from Narita airport. I normally do not write bad reviews when I fly as I know things do occur, but I am writing this review to urge better communication with passengers so we don't feel like we are in the dark. This was the worst travel experience I have ever had. I will never fly through Japan airlines again.",

I've flown on 787's with other airlines in the past, and they've always felt very cramped, however, unlike other airlines JAL only has eight seats across, rather than nine. So the seats were much more spacious width wise. There was also plenty of legroom in front. The crew were very polite and proved good service. The food was very good for economy too. The infight entertainment system was large and very responsive. My only slight criticism is there wasn't as much film/TV choice as on other airlines, and the free headphones were terrible (for my return flight I bought a cheap pair of ear bud earphones instead - highly recommended instead).\nCertainly if I ever fly to Japan again I'll be looking at JAL as a preference.",

Firstly, you can only redeem for flights that start or end in Japan, you cannot use Japan as a connection to some other destination. If you do want to travel somewhere else via JAL, you effectively need to book two flights that end/start in Japan and go through the entire customs -> checkin -> security process in Japan as JAL will not combine them as a proper connecting flight. Also, the points required for a flight or upgrade can vary drastically, the difference of a single day can result in needing 10x as many points.",

        "review_text": "I recently booked a flight from Paris to Sydney premium economy with Japan Airlines. I flew Finnair Paris to Helsinki and then should have been on a Japan Airlines flight from Helsinki to Tokyo. My flight from Paris was delayed so I missed my connecting flight. When I arrived in Helsinki I was told I was being put on a Finnair flight. However Finnair don't have premium economy. When I queried this they told me there was nothing they could do and I would have to take it up with customer service when I got home. \n\nSo I took the flight and then I contacted Japan Airlines when I got home. They have now told me there is nothing they can do. I have to contact Finnair. I am slightly confused by this as I booked and paid my flight through Japan Airlines. In my compliant I was also requesting a refund for the flight I booked. So why would an airline that I didn't pay give a me a refund?   I have gone back to Japan Airlines 3 times and been given the same response each time. They also haven't addressed some of the issues I raised in my letter. \n\nIt is such a shame because I had such a good experience with my flights from Sydney to Paris. However after this, knowing the way they act when something goes wrong I will never fly with them again. They actually have a really good product but their responses to my complaint letters have been diabolical. Looking at some of the other reviews I have read on other websites this seems to be a fundamental issue for them. If you are thinking of flying with Japan Airlines think again - because if something goes wrong they don't want to know.",

This review only applies for domestic flight.\n\nThis airline is good for international flights but if you are using them for domestic flight as a foreigner you will be shut out of all their online service.\nYou cannot book any domestic flights online unless you pretend to live in Japan. And you can only manage your booking as long as you pretend to live in Japan. If you sign up for their JMB program you will not be able to see your domestic flights because you do not live in Japan and this is only available for people living in Japan. To get their app to display English text you need to know Japanese to find the option to switch to English. then of course you cannot log on to your JMB profile because again you have to be Japanese. So then you also cannot automatically find your flights and the get your ticket on the app. And you cannot sign up for JMB pretending to be Japanese so there you go. Shut out of their online services and you are stuck with having to save pdf's or printed out sheets to manage your bookings. \nPlanes are average, the typical smallish domestic aircrafts. Staff is polite tho in the good Japanese fashion. But they seriously need to stop excluding tourists from their online services. Not every tourists wants to use train when going long distances that will take more than 6 hours with train.",

In commercials and other media, JAL was always touted as having great service, luxurious appointments and all that kind of thing.  The actual experience, however, was far different, starting from the very first arrival at Narita airport.  Rather than having a nice special boarding area with such luxuries as a shower, good food, drinks, and other things, it was really no different than any plain old boarding area in any plain old \u201cbudget\u201d class, filled (and I DO mean FILLED) with screaming infants, harried travelers and other unpleasant things.  Usually in any \u201cprestige\u201d waiting area you have nice food displays, larger and more comfortable seats, and things like that.  NONE of that was in evidence here.  Add to that the SHOCKING news that the wait for a shower would be THREE HOURS(!!!), and you have the equivalent of having to wait for your flight in the psycho ward.  On the flight, instead of luxury food and other service, you got something not much different than coach service and food, and the only thing I was glad of was that this was a flight at night and I could just go to sleep and forget all this!  Don\u2019t ever look for me to fly JAL ever again, and I go to Japan usually at least twice a year.  Give me United any day!",

        "review_text": "After spending two lovely weeks in Thailand where both the people were incredibly hands-on and delightful with my 2 year old, I flew home alone with my toddler on JAL from Bangkok to Tokyo; had a 48 hour layover and again from Tokyo to JFK.  \n\nOutbound we flew Cathay Pacific and they were incredibly kind with us, doing anything to make the 24 hour travels easier on us.  BUT JAL only added stress on us.  JAL to Tokyo simply seemed nit-picky. My son had the window shade down and they \u201creally\u201d needed it up - on a plane of 60+ rows.  They also commented on his reusable stickers that leave zero residue - which I showed them, and then they needed them removed \u201cfor the landing.\u201d  I\u2019d understand if they had been real stickers, but it seemed to be a sticking point for them (pun intended).  They also kept serving more food before clearing any trash, so I couldn\u2019t even take a meal for myself because they\u2019d served the kids trays first and then all these snacks and drinks\u2014 but never clears anything before adult meals.  I was buried in trash.  \n\nFinally, and this was the deal breaker for me - on the way from Tokyo to JFK I checked in online in advance and was about to drop my bag off at the luggage check when someone pointed me to \u201cfamily assistance.\u201d  In Hong Kong and Thailand all security and airlines pulled us aside to prioritize us, so I thought the same was to happen.  NOPE!  I had to drag my bag and stroller across the hallway where they insisted I was 5 lbs too heavy for our one bag.  When I explained that we\u2019re permitted FOUR bags and I\u2019ve only checked one, they told me to put the extra 5 lbs in my backpack. This may not seem bad, except when you\u2019re a pretty t revamping alone with a toddler and already managing your child along with 2 carry-on\u2019s and a stroller.  I can\u2019t split into multiple bags.  So they told me to go all the way to the other end of international to the post office to buy a box and I had to old 5 lbs into the box.  They told me it was \u201c no problem.\u201d  But what they failed to realize is that it IS a problem.  As a parent already juggling a lot, now I have to repack my bag at customs upon arrival.  I was furious and so appalled at the lack of service.  \n\nNever again will I fly JAL!",

The initial flight to Japan was very comfortable, and we were practically singing our praises about the in-flight food, entertainment and service.\n\nThe return flight, however, was another story.\n\nWe understood that security would most likely be tighter since it was just in the wake of an Iranian leader's death.  After passing security and customs smoothly, which included facial recognition technology comparing us to our passport pictures, we started boarding the plane.  At the gate, an attendant who was checking the tickets overlooked H and skipped over to the person behind her in line.\n\nOnce we boarded the plane, flight attendants were greeting the passengers as they headed to their seats.  One of them asked to see H's passport, inspected it closely and even dropped it on the floor.  She didn't do this to the passenger before H, and when I offered my own passport to her, she just sent me along without looking at it or touching it.\n\nH felt singled out by this action as she was the only African-American passenger.  Having your passport inspected at security would be one thing, but that was done with no issues.  Once you're past that and boarding the plane, to be treated as suspicious because of your appearance only makes a person feel unwelcome.\n\nWe didn't complain about it to anyone at the time because we wanted to at least make sure we got home.  But now H doesn't want to travel with this airline again if it can be helped.",

        "review_text": "In September 2019 we flew Melbourne - Tokyo (Narita) - New York (JFK) and back in JAL economy.  The direct service from Melbourne to Tokyo is fairly new, as it started on 2 September 2017, and is very welcome.  The seats, food, aircraft and service are all superior to the Qantas alternative which we have also flown recently - Qantas is using very old 747s, whereas JAL is using 787 Dreamliners and the difference in comfort, lighting and particularly noise levels is very noticeable.  Qantas really needs to lift its game.  JAL claims that it had taken a seat out of each row and fitted wider seats, and they were noticeably wider.  Not by a huge amount, but it all adds to the comfort.  We were seated in the exit row so the leg room was good, but I'm 178cm tall and would've been happy with the standard seats as well.  The only negative is that the Melbourne flight goes to Narita rather than Haneda, so you spend about an hour longer getting to and from the airport and domestic connections are more time-consuming - we had to catch a bus from Narita to Haneda to catch our domestic connection.  The other negative is that JAL's inflight entertainment services isn't as good as some other airlines', but at least it's better than it used to be.  \n\nOnce we were back in Australia and putting our points into the JAL Mileage Bank I realised that it was also easier to earn rewards on JAL than Qantas - so we'll probably use the points for upgrades on our next flights with JAL.",

It turned out that you get what you pay for.  The transpacific flights (SAN-NRT, NRT-SAN) were in 787-800s.  JAL uses the Sky Suite which is an innovative design that allows them to get a 2-2-2 configuration, where many airlines are using a 1-2-1.  The seat is comfortable and converts to a spacious fully flat seat, nicely squared off.  The downside is that there is nowhere to store anything in fully flat mode.  The inter-Asia flights (HND-SGN and TPE-NRT) were in shell flat seat configuration which is angled-flat.  Not a great seat.  \n\nFood was decent, though not spectacular.  On the long flights there's a service just after take-off and a second whenever you wish, up to two hours before landing.  JAL is promoting the top chefs who develop their menu, but an airplane galley is not a great place for execution.  The food quality was variable.\n\nService was generally very friendly and professional.  No faults here with one big execption.  At the international transfer desk in NRT, after checking in, I was told by the woman at the desk that there were two lounges that I could use.  One just upstairs, and one closer to my gate.  But that the upstairs lounge was very nice and the one by the gate was 'not so good'.  I was just going to sit and read and have a drink so I walked the 15 mins to the lounge closer to the gate.  Turns out that 'not so good' means closed for renovation, and had been so for some time.  And at this point I was too far out to make it back to the other lounge.  IMO, this is an inexcusable mistake on JALs part.",

Cathay has a similar seat, but they were astute enough to carve out some space below the side console. \n\nAs others have said, JL really lacks in the IFE department. I tend to watch on my own tablet. I wanted to watch a Korean film called Parasite, but it was only available in Japanese subtitles (wth)? \n\nJAL really shines when it comes to the Japanese meal option. However, they should offer one more western option; not everyone likes to eat red meat. Moreover, after having flown JL a few times, I long for something besides simmered burdock or braised fish. \n\nThe FAs are pleasant, polite and check up on pax frequently. \n\nI try to seek JAL when flying to Japan and beyond because I\u2019m an Alaska Mileage Plan member. \n\nHowever, I\u2019m leaning more towards ANA these days; they\u2019re consistent with their business class seat offerings. Meanwhile, JL has three international versions (why????). \n\nThe Sakura Lounge in NRT is solid, but I actually prefer the Admirals Club (sadly, they\u2019re closing in Mar 2020).",

My SO and I were planning our annual international vacation and, as luck would have it, came across relatively cheap flights to Japan in December. Here\u2019s the catch: It included a brief layover in Dallas (Seattle on the return flight), but certainly more tolerable than that in Hong Kong. (Virtually any layover is preferable to that of twenty-three hours at the HK Airport...)The flight into Narita was fairly smooth, as the airline staff provided utmost courtesy and comfort. I will say with utmost  Bconfidence that the economy seats at JAL single-handedly top United, my other favorite mid-priced international airline. American Airlines (sorry to say) do not come close, either in the staff\u2019s attitudes nor in the food and entertainment selections. JAL provides a succinct snapshot of the culture, itself: unadulterated cleanliness, customer care, and courtesy that is genuine, rather than one projected by fake smiles. As par for the course of a flight into Japan, we experienced somewhat frequent turbulence (an aerial version of an earthquake, as if were), it seemed to occur almost on cue, while the staff served and poured beverages. Naturally, my red wine added a splash of color to the tray table. The program selection was excellent, as I was able to dive headlong into Japanese cinema and get in the zone for my trip. Every venture into the country feels new and fresh, regardless of the frequency, with which I visit. This was my third time abs certainly will be one of many more to come, especially if it is via JAL.",

The seats were VERY cramped, with a lot of space taken by a very bulky console between the two seats. When in the flat position for sleeping, the whole seat was raised, making it an even more cramped situation. It was brutally hot during the flight, and when I asked about it, the attendant said that there was nothing that could be done. I understand from friends who were in coach that after multiple requests to lower the temperature, their cabin became more comfortable. Amenity kits were nothing special, the wine was house-wine quality, and other than the dinner, the food was average, and the entertainment choices were very limited, especially for a flight of that length. \n\nOn the return flight, on American, the seats were definitely more spacious and comfortable. The service was acceptable, and the cabin personnel were attentive. I have friends who have asked my opinion about which airline to use, and contrary to my general policy of avoiding AA, I found that on this this routing, American was superior to JAL.",

We really like their flying schedule and chose to fly to Delhi via Tokyo on JAL after comparing it with airlines that fly across the Atlantic.  There were a couple of areas that could do with improvement: The specially prepared \"Chef\" meals can be a hit or a miss, and on the flight from Tokyo to San Diego the food was very unappetizing.  We also did not understand why on the daytime flight from San Diego to Tokyo, they darkened the cabin for 6 daylight hours, when one's internal clock should be on daylight time!  This did not make any sense, unless JAL was trying somehow to reduce activity and service to save money.  It felt a bit manipulative.  Otherwise the flights were very comfortable, restrooms were always clean, and the pilots were excellent landing gently on different runways.",

        "type_of_route": "International",
        "review_text": "I had about an hour between connecting flights and made use of the JAL First Class Lounge at Narita near gate 60.  The lounge is under renovation.  The upstairs renovation is completed so the dining area upstairs is in great condition and well equipped.  As for the main floor, more than half the lounge area is now closed for renovation so there is only a seating area on the main floor with all dining moved upstairs.  The upstairs dining area now serves food to order instead of a buffet.  There is a sushi station offering a set of three different pieces of sushi, which selection changes every week.  There is also a noodle station offering a choice of two different soup noodles, which you order and then are given a device which will signal when your order is ready.  Finally there are two stations offering Western and Japanese style dishes made to order such as pasta or, on this visit, chicken in mushroom cream sauce.  On a side island station, there are serveral breads and pastries and soups for self service.  All the food I tried was very good and presented on beautiful plates too. \n\nThe flight boarded on time at 6:15 pm for the 6:40 pm flight.  The flight is operated with a B767-300 with 6 rows of 4 seats each in business class configured 1X2X1.  I had seat 2A, a window seat that is nicely positioned next to the window with a cabinet next to it between the seat and the aisle for greater privacy (row 1 and the other odd numbered rows have the opposite arrangement with the seat next to the aisle and the cabinet next to the window).  Business class was not full on the flight with about 6 empty seats.  The seat is the Sky Suite II fully horizontal flatbed seat.  When reclined to the bed position, the bed lies very low to the ground.  Sleep was fairlly comfortable on the seat in bed position but the bed is quite narrow if sleeping on one's back rather than side.  \n\nThere were two meal services - dinner shortly after takeoff and then breakfast about 2 hours before landing.  For dinner, there was a choice of a Japanese meal or two different Western meals.  The Japanese set starts with a bento box of many different items followed by a main of marinated chicken and yellowtail teriyaki with rice, ending with a dessert of sesame pudding.  The Western meals both start with several hors-d'oeuvres and then a main of either roasted Japanese beef sirloin or olive flounder with clams, ending with a dessert of a cream puff stuffed with bitter chocolate cream and yuzu confit.  For breakfast, the choice was between the Japanese set with simmered pork or the Western set with an omelette with bolognese sauce.  I had the Japanese choice with both meals, but opted for the chocolate cream puff dessert from the Western menu instead for dinner.  All the food was beautifully presented and delicious.  \n\nI also made a point of having coffee at both meals since JAL serves special monthly chosen coffee in business class on its flights.  In fact, the menu has a description of the monthly coffee, in the same way as the available wines and sakes are introduced. \n\nBetween take off and preparation for landing, and the two meal service, almost half of the 8 hr 22 min flight time was used up so I only managed about 4 hours of sleep on the flight.     \n\nService in business class on the flight was wonderful as usual.  The cabin staff were very efficient and gracious in meal service and clean up, were constantly going through the cabin to see if passengers needed anything else, and constantly cleaned the toilets so they were always in good condition.  \n \nOur flight landed on time and first bags were delivered to the luggage carousel promptly within about 20 minutes after landing. \n\nAnother wondeful flight on JAL superb gracious service and great food.",

I should not have been worried as not only did the flight leave early, but it also got in early!! \n\nThe flight was just under 12 hours, which played havoc on my knees and back. However the attendants were always on hand with an extra cushion, drink or additional food (of which I took advantage of each time!). \n\nI am 6\" and there was good leg space in economy, and my only issue was on the return flight when the individual in front of me reclinded their seat for the best part of four hours....no fault of JAL of course. \n\nOverall it was a good flight with efficent timing and atentive staff. Would recommend and use again for any future Japan visits.",

We were welcomed with hard rejection of the lounge usage and lounge receptionists weren't helping much, kept telling us we were not registered.   We were sure that we were registered to use the lounge but it was not on their record.\n\n2nd thing on the returning flight, when they deliver meals to us, we were sitting at the end row and one of the 2 choices meal they had run out.   That could happen because again it is an economy class but the food provided as a result was enormously bad taste.   I have been using multiple airlines in my life, maybe 20 or so, but it was the worst of all, I had to spit out and didn't even touch the rest.   It was the same for rest of the people in my group, we were group of 4.\n\nThe other meal provided on the same flight was also extremely terrible.   Not sure how to describe but they should be serving purchased $10 bento or sandwich box at the airport instead of such terrible meals.   It was way over the limit even it is for economy class.\n\nIt was cheaply priced flight  for sure but they should at least give us some dignity.",

        "review_text": "We flew round trip in premium economy in October (to) and November (from).  \n\nSTELLAR SERVICE:  The cabin crew is unfailingly polite, helpful and attentive. If only all airlines could offer this level of service. The onboarding process in both directions was breathtakingly organized and efficient. The best two onboarding experiences in all our years of travel.  It really makes you wonder why it can't always be that way.  (Don't make something simple something hard!)\n\nCOMFORT: The premium economy seats are comfortable and certainly worth the price. The restrooms are cleaned and restocked so frequently that they are always fresh and pleasant to use.  \n\nNUTS AND BOLTS: The power outlets in either of our seats did not work in either direction and that was a downer, particularly on such a long flight.  Underseat storage in front of you is limited but better than some others.  The headphones weren't great and outlets didn't accept our headphones.  The movie selection was poor and resolution not great.  On the flight between JFK and Haneda, the plane was so hot it kept us awake.  The flight back was very pleasant.\n\nFOOD:  we have read here that many people liked the food on their flights.  We found it awful. Really awful.  Both flights. The best and saving grace was the ramen noodle cups made available on our return flight.\n\nDespite the negatives, we view JAL very favorably.  They treat people very well and the kindness and consideration shown by their personnel (ncluding check in) is exemplary. Premium Economy is comfortable and good value.\n\nWe will likely fly JAL preferentially whenever possible.",

        "review_text": "My first flight to Japan was on JAL.  I made sure the aircraft was a 787, for the many hidden comfort features built into that particular model aircraft.  I was well pleased with the result.  JAL configured seating on the Boeing 787-8 aircraft in Economy (International) with their \"E12\" configuration, resulting in 8 seats across, better than many competitors, who use 9 seats across.  Cabin comfort in the 787 due to better air, better humidity and lower noise, was excellent.  The crew was helpful, efficient, unobtrusive and friendly.  The flight path chosen by the Captain avoided turbulence while reaching our destination on time. If you like to avoid surprises, JAL is a solid choice.  The mother with infant who was seated in our bulkead row center section was given a wall-mount bassinet, allowing the infant to sleep comfortably and quietly, directly in front of Oka-san. The cost was very affordable, though I did not compare airlines to search for cheaper fares. Video/audio entertainment was good.  Meals were amazing, with stainless flatware--in Eonomy.  Seriously.  So, I'm not even going to look at any other airlines for my next trip to Japan or other East Asia destinations.  Then, there is this:  \nNote:  Japan Airlines (JAL), was awarded by customers for featuring the World's Best Economy Class and the Best Economy Class Airline Seat at the at the Skytrax* 2019 World Airline Awards held at the Paris Air Show.",

This has always been my experience on Japan Airlines!!\n\nI had a lot of in flight movies, TV, and music programs to choose from; Western and international, with or without subtitles (my choice).\n\nThe food and cabin service was good, and the flight attendants courteous and professional. Good eye contact and respectful, giving me their full attention when they were addressing me (Thank you Ms Bando!!) I had confidence that they would be able to handle any situation.\n\nThe entire cabin was nicely appointed and the lavatories were always clean (the flight attendants see to that; excellent job (not everyone\u2019s favorite!!!). My seat, the carpeting, and the tray tables were well maintained and clean too. Not always the case on most other airlines I\u2019ve flown!!\n\nAt 21 hours flying time, it\u2019s definitely a long haul, but my experience onboard made it one of the best economy experiences I\u2019ve had. \n\nThis was also a GREAT VALUE!! I paid $938USD, round trip, which is a highly competitive fare. Combined with the service, aircraft, and baggage allowance, it was a great value!! \n\nDomo Arigato Japan Airlines!!!!",

We travelled Premium Ecomony because of the fact that I am nervous so wanted to be as comfortable as possible, and it was definately worth paying extra as the seats were very roomy and comfortable with plenty of leg room. I spoke with a member of the crew and explained that I was nervous so he asked my name and checked on me regulary throughout the flight to make sure I was ok. The bathrooms were kept very clean, but now having been to Japan and seen how clean the country is, its understandable why the planes are so clean. I forgot to mention the boarding process at Frankfurt and how amazing quick it was. Premium Economy boarded and the we were ready to go but we did not even realise that Economy had even boarded, so we guessed they boarded both at the same time but at different entrances. The only downside was the food. None of it was good which was disappointing but then again plane food is never good! Overall, the flight was good and the staff were great and I would recommend Japan Airlines with no hesitation. I just hope I get to fly with them again (we loved Japan too so it is likely we will go back!).",

You are at the bottom of four class levels and you really feel it. Food service is hurried and limited- not a lot of selections for drinks. Movie selections were limited. That said, you are no doubt getting bigger seats than on any American airline and they do have direct flights from NYC. I would take them again for those reasons, but not gladly. Our flight to Tokyo was probably made worse by a child who cried loudly practically the entire way there. The plane was pretty much full, so no possibility to move further away from the crying.  Fourteen and a half hours on a plane is probably too much for a 1 1/2 year old child. Parents probably need to look into some sort of sleep aid for a child of that age. Otherwise, they are being very inconsiderate of other passengers.",

The buffet had a good selection of food including JAL\u2019s trademark beef curry, but does not have any made to order stations as found in JAL\u2019s First Class lounge in Narita (and before in Haneda).

It picked up a bit closer to 11 pm but there were still plenty of seats for everyone to stretch out a bit with empty seats buffers for all. \n\nI made my way to my gate 112 a bit early and lined up in Group 1 for OneWorld Emeralds and JAL top tier members.  JAL sorts passengers into 5 groups and has separate lines for each group, very orderly.  Uncharacteristically, the flight was late in boarding by about 5 to 10 minutes.  As a result, pushback was also late at about 12:15 am for the 12:05 am scheduled flight.  Take off was about 12:33 am with the video monitor showing a flight time of 6 hours 20 minutes.  \n\nThe flight was operated with a B777-200 equipped with the Sky Suite III horizontal fully flatbed seat laid out 1X2X1 in Business Class.  I had the first window seat 1A, which was nice as it was on the side with an additional toilet at the front and the front galley was located on the other side of the plane so there was no galley noise or traffic near my seat.  The downside for seat 1A is that it only has one window whereas most other window seats appear to have two windows.  The Sky Suite III seat is a bit unusual in that it does not have a leg rest that can be raised in recline position like the Sky Suite II seat.  Instead, the entire seat just slides forward and flattens out for recline to a flatbed.  When fully reclined to the bed position, the passenger\u2019s legs fit into quite a deep hole under the video screen but as a result, the exit space to the aisle is located quite high up the body when lying down so it is a bit difficult to exit to the aisle from the bed position.  There is a small storage cabinet on the window side of the seat to store the headphones and the bottled water provided on boarding, and there is another storage space under the armrest on the aisle side which can be raised or lowered.  With the aisle side armrest lowered, there is extra width to the seat in bed position but I found the material of the armrest to be a bit too hard to comfortably rest my arms on it, as opposed to on the cushioned seat.  That said and also perhaps because it was a late night flight, I found the Sky Suite III to be quite comfortable to sleep in and slept for about 4 \u00bd hours on the flight.\n\nOn boarding, Business Class passengers found a form at their seat for them to fill in as to breakfast preference.  I opted to be woken up for breakfast and chose the Japanese menu.  As soon as we took off and the seatbelt sign was turned off, I reclined my seat to bed position and fell asleep fairly quickly.  About two hours before landing, the lights were turned on and breakfast was served.  As usual, the Japanese meal was both beautifully presented and delicious.  I also had some coffee as JAL serves special coffee in business class sourced from a coffee hunter based in Tokyo.  The coffee is always excellent and JAL even includes a description of the coffee of the month in the menu with growing region background and tasting notes just like for wines. \n\nOur flight landed a few minutes early at 5:01 am.  Immigration was quick as Business Class passengers have use of the Premium Lane which only had a couple of people in each line.  Therefore I was at the luggage carousel before the first bags started arriving about half an hour after our flight landed.  One of the benefits of an overnight flight is that Bangkok\u2019s notorious traffic is not a factor at all and I was able to get into the city center in only about half an hour with the light traffic of early morning.",

When we arrived to the Bangkok airport for return to Tokyo, seat assignments in hand, they said that our tickets had been cancelled.  Even though there were empty seats in their flight, the Japan Airlines officials refused to honor any portion of our paid tickets, or to put us on the flight.  Our option, pay for new, one way tickets on Thai air (very nice by the way), and wait for 8 hours in the Bangkok airport. \n Next time we will just avoid the headache and skip Japan Airlines entirely.  They would not even give us the frequent flyer mileage we paid for. \n Stingy and bureaucratic would be two words to describe that behavior.  \nShockingly when they use Japan in their name, a country that excels at customer service.",

        "review_text": "I flew JAL from Vancouver to Narita in business class.  Prior to the flight, I opted to use the Cathay Pacific lounge rather than the Plaza Premium third party lounge offered by JAL since the CX lounge is much nicer and much less crowded (Plaza Premium allows anyone to enter by paying, always crowded).  As usual excellent service in the CX lounge particularly as the JAL flight is about a half hour earlier than the CX flight so the CX passengers largely had not arrived at the lounge yet when I was there. CX offers the noodle bar with hot food to order, and also a side buffet with sandwiches, salads, desserts.  I tried the chicken risotto (quite good but a bit too salty) and shrimp dumplings (wrapping stuck to the paper so both dumplings ripped open when I tried to pick them up) but did not want more food since I had to save room for the great meal service on JAL. \n\nGeneral boarding for the 12:35 pm flight commenced promptly at 12:15 pm (pre-boards - those who require assistance and young children started earlier around 12:10 pm).  JAL has switched to a B767-800 instead of the B787 Dreamliner for this route.  The trade-off is an older plane but better seats in business class with Sky Suite II fully flat bed seats instead of the angle flat Shell Flat Neo on the B787 Dreamliner.  The seats are configured 1X2X1 with just 6 rows and 24 seats in the business class cabin, considerably less than the 30 to 30+ seats on the Dreamliner configured 2X2X2.  Every seat has direct aisle access and the window seats alternate rows with a console beside the seat on the window side or the aisle side.  My seat 2A has the console on the aisle side so provided a bit more privacy from what happens in the aisle.  \n\nIn addition to converting to a fully flat bed, the Sky Suite II seats also have a lower back massage function, which felt quite nice. \n\nThe flight was slightly late on pushback due to some passengers boarding a bit late, and then there was quite a wait after pushback before the plane started to move to taxi and ultimately take off was a bit after 1 pm. The flight was not very full in business class with about 6 empty seats out of 24 (though one was being used as a pilot rest seat).  \n\nAs always, a highlight of the flight are the meal services, with each meal being beautifully presented.  I had the Japanese meal for the lunch served after take off, which started with a bento box of 5 delicious and visually attractive starters, then rice with both salmon and sukiyaki beef, and finished with the lemon mousse cake dessert.  JAL serves a special coffee in business class and the menu describes in detail the coffee of the month, much as a wine review would describe a wine.  As a result, I always have at least a couple of cups of coffee on JAL flights. \n\nFor the second meal, I chose the Western option of a ham and cheese frittata.  Also good but was disappointed the croissant came bare without any butter or jam.\n\nThere appeared to be at least 3 cabin stewards, including the purser, attending to the small business class cabin so service was very attentive and always courteous and excellent.  They seem to be constantly cleaning the toilets, even taking the time to fold the toilet paper into a triangle at the end.  A gentleman was celebrating his birthday that day and the cabin crew actually brought him a bottle of champagne, a little fruit plate and a small gift bag and sang happy birthday to him (cabin staff even went around to the other guests to ask them to join in the celebration). \n\nThe entertainment system is a bit weaker in selection than perhaps Cathay Pacific, partly because many selections are Japanese only. \n\nDue to the time of the flight, I did not sleep much as it was mostly afternoon and early evening Vancouver time, but did find the flat bed comfortable enough for napping. \n\nThe flight was quite turbulent and at the wrong times - during both meal service.  For the second meal service, the turbulence was sufficient to cause the cabin crew to serve coffee in a paper cup with a plastic lid instead of a ceramic cup.\n\nDue to a combination of the late pushback and take-off and probably a relatively long flight time, we arrived around 20 minutes late.  Perhaps this was the reason we had a remote stand and had to walk down steps and be bused to the terminal.  Arriving around 5 pm into Narita is a horrible time for immigration line-ups with so many arriving passengers flooding towards the passport control counters that airport staff had to hold up signs indicating where the end of the queue line was.  All told, it took about 45 minutes from the plane touching down on the runway to my exiting into the arrivals hall after passport control and customs.  There is no priority immigration lane that can be used by JAL business class passengers, so everyone just joins the general line.\n\nAll in all, another excellent flight on JAL with excellent service and food.",

From Chicago to Japan, there is only one AA flight service, so I had no choice to book the AA flight operated by Japan Airline (JAL). Then, I tried to select my seat in advance, but simply was unable to do it. So, I contacted AA and learnt that JAL is very strict about seat selection for code share flights (irrespective of the AA membership levels). This is ridiculous given that both AA and JAL are now Oneworld Alliance members (and also given that AA passengers may have to use the AA flight operated by JAL if it is the only one AA flight service provided). I have no intention of becoming a JAL member again (I am Japanese and used to be a JAL member) only to solve this issue (i.e., I have more domestic travels in US, relative to flying between Japan and US). Japanese airline companies, including JAL, provide excellent care and service to passengers, which I like very much, but JAL (and probably All Nippon Airways?) can be more flexible about seat selection for code share flights.",

Plane is a 777-300.\nService and catering was excellent, very generous measures for all drinks too, only small negatives are that the Business seat space is a little tight with the JAL 2-3-2 staggered configuration and the window seats could do with more storage space.\nAlso took a look at the Premium Economy cabin, seats seemed spacious and comfortable and cabin has much better design for the twin toilet area compared to Cathay Pacific's noisy and poorly placed single toilet on the 777-300 plane. Will definitely be using the JAL PE service in the future.\nThe fare paid for this trip was surprisingly reasonable and the connection flight JL707 continued the excellemnt level of service.",

I appreciate that they were in the aftermath of a typhoon in Japan, but nonetheless, it is unacceptable for an airline to just go \"AWOL\"!!\n\nIn the circumstances, my travel agent advised me to go to the airport early and see if the staff there could help me. This I did, but the guy on the check-in desk could do nothing for me. He suggested that I speak with the JAL staff in the American Airlines lounge, once through security.\n\nHere's the best bit - when I got to the lounge, I was told that the JAL staff had gone home for the day!! Can you imagine my frustration at this? The flight from ORD to NRT was delayed by many hours, but the JAL staff didn't even bother to wait around to deal with travelers' queries! I'm sure that they would have known that there were going to have many customers in similar circumstances to myself.\n\nEffectively, I was left in a situation where I was leaving ORD with no idea what arrangements would be put in place for my onward connection.\n\nAll of this amounted to a thoroughly disappointing experience - the first time that I was taking this route under a JAL ticket, although I have flown the route on an AA code share number on previous occasions. Based on the thoroughly unsatisfactory customer experience with JAL, I am extremely reluctant to fly JAL again (particularly as a JAL flight). At least, if I had flown on an AA ticket, I could have expected much better customer service, as an Emerald OneWorld member.",

        "review_text": "We flew back to the UK with Boeing777-300ER (773) aircraft. Despite the fact that we couldn't select our seats in advance, we were fortunate enough to be given the front seats in the Economy class ( aisle and middle). I was  very pleased at  first that I was given a seat with more leg room than other seats. There was an English passenger who was already seated at the window seat when we got to our seats. I had to sit in the middle seat as my husband preferred to take the aisle seat and didn't have much complaint up to the time when I realised that the seat I was allocated had some faults later on. The passenger next to me was a large lady with an injured leg and she kept moving about within her seat. Unfortunately everytime she moved,  tossed or turned, the rest of the seat ( i.e. my seat directly and my husband's) were affected in that her movement made the rest of the seats to be shaken badly and we hardly could get any sleep in this flight journey. When I was seated in the middle trying desperately to get some sleep, my seat was shaken in connection with this passenger's movement. It was almost as my seat was constantly pulled from behind when she moved each time. To make the matters worse, this passenger would like to take a peak at the view outside the window shutter a few times for the duration of the journey. When the aircraft was flying into a daytime zone, she opened the shutter unexpectedly and it really interrupted my sleep. I really couldn't wait to see the end of the journey and get away from this hell. Honestly I really wished I could have my seat swapped with another had there been any vacant seat available. Unfortunately it was a full house with a large entourage of Japanese school  kids also on the same flight. The only good thing about this journey was excellent customer service provided by the cabin attendants and food being served. Next time I fly back from Japan to the UK, I hope to get a better seat with possibly a better and more polite passenger. Another annoying incident once the aircraft finally landed at Heathrow was that we were told off by a grumpy old English passenger at the Premium Economy class not to block the aisle when we were already waiting with our luggage for the aircraft door to open (this was after the seat belt sign was turned off upon arrival ). I mean some people would like to get off quickly (for transit etc) and for that reasons, they are waiting standby with luggages. They are not blocking the aisle deliberately but simply just want to get out of the aircraft quickly as possible. I don't quite understand why he has to complain about us and he himself ended up standing at the aisle waiting to get out whilst we were waiting for  the door to open. Just because he has paid extra for the seat doesn't give him any more automatic privilege and rights than the rest of the passengers in Economy class.  Please note my rating on this review just refers to the quality of travel I had with this particular aircraft, nothing to complain about the JAL service or staff. I think they were excellent hosts. It's just a pity that on this journey I had a terrible journey back from Japan to the UK.",

        "review_text": "This is the second JAL operated flight I took from UK/EU to Japan. We were fortunate  to have flown into Japan with the latest aircraft carrier ( Boeing 777-346). From the last review I have done for JAL flight, they have made more improvement in the choice of the aircraft carrier: one of the feature which I was pleased about this carrier was the window shutters - no window shutters, so especially the passengers (who would like to keep the window left open during the whole journey) can't do anything about !  The window was shutterless, but it can shut any brightness or glares out coming in from the Sun outside. The Economy seat dimension (JAL Sky Wider) was another great feature in that the width of the seat and leg room was more than the conventional Economy seat and it doesn't seem to affect me that much even if the person in front of me decides to recline the seat.  In addition, I feel some improvement was made to the touch panel screen, which has become more touch sensitive so that you won't have to touch the screen with more force, which I hate to see especially when your rear passenger is someone who likes to tap abruptly at the screen rather than touch while you are asleep. So overall I was very pleased with the aircraft and the quality of the  travel from Frankfurt to Narita.",

Things like seat room, cleanliness, food were average and what you would expect from a mid priced airline on a economy seat. Entertainment was at the same level as BA but not as good as Virgin. \nThe staff were AMAZING. They were polite and smiled when they served you (a rare thing with cabin crew these days). They were efficient, remembered the children meals we had ordered, again an issue we have had again and again with Virgin and BA with very unhelpful/rude staff from both. The staff couldn\u2019t do enough for you and found that completely refreshing.",

The service at the JAL kiosk is impeccable, and I dare say better than what you'd experience at the Admiral's Club. The flight itself is pretty standard for business class. I prefer AA long hauls--there's just a little more freedom to wander. JAL customers seem very orderly by contrast. The cabins feel a little dated, too, though the seats lay completely flat, and the entertainment options are good, and the food in business was actually much better than what I experience on AA. The service on board was excellent, as expected, friendly but slightly formal. JAL terminal and Sakura Lounge at Narita were excellent with good shopping and dining.",

Invariably most airlines, the problem is the understaffed airport services, like check in, transfer, baggage drop off, ticketing etc.\nMost flights once they take off, are usually fine.\nI know they can do only so much in the air.\nI also understand they can only do so much on the ground, when the place usually look line lines at Disneyland.

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.\"\n\nWas mentioned that I can contact Local Japan Airlines in Jakarta and I did it and waiting for almost 40 minutes without never able to reach the reservation staff. The other no was an answering and open only for week day office hour.\n\nOn October 13th 2019 as I received no information at all about my flight schedule so \nI came to the airport 04.00 AM\n\nJapan Airlines check in counter open and assisted by Japan Airlines staff ( Use JAL Uniform) who immediately told  me that this is a force majeure and He can't do anything about it. \n\nI told him I open my reservation online and I saw Japan Airlines already rebooked my flight October 14th KE 81  Seoul Incheoon 10.00  but he said its a computer generated itinerary and nothing he can't do about it.\n\nWhile we talked I found out via Flight Radar  that JAL 720 on that morning fly to Tokyo. I noticed that every single Japanese\nnationalities assisted by Japan Airlines staff (Japanese and wear JAL Uniform)  assisted quietly to Immigration.\n\nI also received an email from Japan Airlines that Flight JL4 Tokyo to New York back \nto operation as per schedule.\n\nI'm a frequent traveller so I asked the counter if he can transfer me to Qatar Airways \n( Both JAL and Qatar member of One World)\n\nFirst he try to confuse me and he said he will transfer me via China airlines, Malaysian Airlines and Cathay Pacific.\n\nAfter I pushed him finally he was able to book my flight to New York QR 957 13 October 2019 ETA 17.25.

But the main thing is that the airline gives the full impression of really wanting you on the plane. Thats not always true of USA carriers. To give a small example. I left my pencil case in the lounge at Narita Airport. I told the flight attendant and soon a pencil case was being run the length of the airport and delivered on to the flight just before take-off.  It was only a pencil case but JAL treated with care. I hear many stories like this. Excellent airline. Always my first choice.",

        "review_text": "The below is a letter I sent to JAL by e-mail but five day later no response.\nDear Sir/Madam\n\nIt was most disappointing to end my great trip to Japan with having to deal with a lying disrespectful JAL person when trying to check in along with being fleeced for a considerable amount of money I shouldn't have had to pay. \n\nWhile I missed my inward flight to Japan through no fault at all on JAL part due to my flight to Manila being cancelled and me having to get a later flight, it was most distressing to find when going to get the return flight that this had been cancelled, this was despite the JAL personnel at T1 in Manila telling me this wouldn't be a problem when I didn't make the time to check in there. I flew with another airline to Japan later that day as JAL didn't have any more flights I could get on that day.\n\nI would like someone to please explain the following and are hopeful for honest answers which is something I certainly did not get last night at the Narita airport,\n\nWhy was my ticket cancelled without informing me after I had been told that it would be OK to use by JAL staff in Manila\nWhy did the young gentleman checking me in tell me that this is a World wide rule with all airlines that if you don't use the inward leg the return is cancelled (I know this is not true as I've experienced the same with China Air and Air New Zealand, Cebu Pacific and PAL for various reasons and never had an issue with the return leg)\nWhy does JAL have this rule where tickets are cancelled without contacting the Customer - a very poor rule that you need to reconsider\nWhy when I first started to try and check in and was told that my ticket was cancelled and that it was impossible to check me in and despite that seats were available on the flight - this shouldn't have been seen as impossible - there is very little that is impossible, this should have been very simple to sort.\nOn being told I would have to pay for a new ticket which I said I would that the plane was suddenly full and the only seat left was a Business class seat. I said that would have to do as I had to be in Manila today as I have a meeting with people flying in from Taiwan, Thailand & Malaysia.\nI was told the price for the ticket was Y176,460 , while this seemed expensive even for a business seat I said yes I would do that as I had to get to Manila that night. I very much got the impression the young man didn't think I would accept this and didn't want me to fly that night.]\nWhy after being told that there was only one seat left did the young gent ask me if I wanted a window or aisle seat? I challenged him on this if he was lying when he told me there was only one Business class seat left, he said that some passengers had not turned up for the flight.\nWhy after being told that I had to buy the only Business class seat left on the plane did I get a Economy seat for the Y176,460, again I asked why I had a Economy seat when he told me the price was for the only Business Class seat available. His response was that he hadn't told me that was for a Business class seat another blatant lie. \nWhy once the plane took off was I able to walk around the plane and spot 21 empty seats after being lied to that the plane was full? \nThe empty seats were as follows;\n Row 19 E\nRow 20 A/E\nRow 24 E/G\nRow 25 K\nRow 26 E/F\nRow 27 D\nRow 29 E/F\nRow 47 A\nRow 51 E/G/K\nRow 52 E/G/K\nRow 53 F\nRow 54 E/G\nWhat a disappointment it was dealing with a dishonest and disrespectful person that works for you after such a great trip to Japan where I found everything to be so good and the people so polite, honest, respectful and disciplined this was the first person I met on the trip who is a disgrace to the good people of the Japanese nation. I will not let me put this off Japan as I plan to have another holiday in Winter and maybe catch some of the Olympics. I will however be flying with another Airline, this person has lost me as a customer for good and I will pass onto all my contacts how poor JAL treat their customers.\n\nI'm hoping someone at JAL can answer my questions above.\n\nKind Regards Michael J McGrory",

Impeccable service from the cabin crew, who were courteous, charming and went out of their way to be helpful.  Everything else was good, but it was the crew that made the extra difference. Food was excellent, with a choice of Japanese or Western menu and good wine and beverage choices, again including some Japanese options (sake, umeshu).  Seat was roomy and comfortable, with support to keep your legs up - it's perfect for short/medium haul and although the lie-flat bed option isn't great (a bit short and not completely flat), it seems this isn't the seat JAL uses for long haul flights any more.  Decent entertainment selection with easy to use touch screen system and for once the headphone jack is clearly marked and easy to find (so often not the case).   The only downside is that JAL doesn't seem to fly from Hong Kong to Haneda, a much better airport with much better access than Narita.  Nonetheless, JAL will be my preferred option for Tokyo from now on.",

        "type_of_route": "Southeast Asia",
        "review_text": "I took the JAL ovenight flight from Osaka Kansai airport to Bangkok.  The flight is the last departure for JAL for the night at 12:55 am.  When I first arrived at the Sakura lounge at Kansai around 9:30 pm, it was very busy as JAL shares the lounge with a number of other airlines including Emirates and there were a number of jumbo international flights around 11 pm.  By 11 pm though, the lounge was almost empty as most of the other flights for JAL and the other airlines were boarding or had departed already. \n\nThe Sakura lounge has a good selection of food in a buffet - several hot vegetable dishes, sandwiches, salads, halal beef hamburger pieces, and of course, JAL's trademark beef curry with rice.  After I had eaten, I noticed staff then brought out different items for the buffet including a Japanese noodle offering and fried pork and fried lotus root on skewers.  There was plenty of food on offer for a dinner pre-flight. Service as always with JAL is extremely good - food is replenished promptly and as soon as a guest finishes, staff rush over to clean the table for the next guest. \n\nThe late night flight boarded and pushbacked on schedule.  Flight time was 5 hours 20 minutes.  JAL uses a B787-800 with the Shell Flat Neo seat in a 2X2X2 configuration in business class for this flight.  The Shell Flat Neo is an angle flat seat and the window seat passenger has to step over the aisle passenger to access the aisle.  However as I had seat 1A in the first row, it was easy to step over the aisle seat passenger as there is no console from another seat in front blocking me.  While the seat is only angle flat, I find it quite comfortable to sleep in as it seems to have greater width at the shoulder and chest level than JAL's fully flat Sky Suite I, II and III product. \n\nOn boarding there was a meal service selection card at each seat for the passenger to select whether to be woken for breakfast or not.  I chose to be woken for breakfast notwithstanding the short sleep time on the flight as JAL has excellent food.  I was not disappointed as the Japanese set breakfast that I was served was both beautiful to look at, and filled with a wide variety of great flavours from a bento box of a selection of several starters and a hot main of fish and vegetables. \n\nDue to the late night departure time, very quickly after takeoff, the captain announced it was fine to recline one's seat and most passengers quickly settled in to sleep.  About an hour and 20 minutes before landing, I was woken for breakfast service. \n\nService was exceptional with the purser for the flight making a point of coming by to chat with each passenger once they awoke, and making sure to provide reminders about the premium lane fast track through immigration set-up that is provided for business class passengers arriving in Bangkok.  She also went through the cabin prior to landing to individually thank each business class passenger for flying with JAL. \n\nThe flight landed about 20 minutes early at 4:18 am.  There is quite a long walk from the gate to immigration but so early in the morning, it was not busy at the airport or immigration.  First bags arrived at the luggage carousel around 4:53 am shortly after I got there.  One benefit of the early morning arrival is the lack of traffic on the roads.  I was at my hotel in the Sukhumvit area in less than 30 minutes as opposed to the one hour plus travel time that is the norm.",

This is a very short flight of only about an hour, and JAL put too nice a product on this short haul flight with a B787-800 equipped with Sky Suite fully flatbed seats in J Class (domestic business class) in a 2X2X2 configuration.  With such a short flight time, there was really not much chance to take advantage of the fully flatbed feature, but I did appreciate the privacy of the seat with semi-enclosed seats and staggered set up so my window seat had direct aisle access without having to step over the passenger next to me.  There was a large video screen for my seat but on this short flight, the entertainment programs were disabled so the screen only showed flight information. There was a quick paper cup drink service for the short flight.  \n\nOur pushback was about 10 minutes late and there was about a half hour wait for take-off due to heavy traffic at Narita airport in the early evening slot.  As a result, the flight arrived about 10 minutes late. First bags arrived at the luggage carousel about 20 minutes after landing. \n\nI was headed for Kobe and luckily, the airport limousine bus to Sannomiya station in Kobe is quite frequent and I was on the bus enroute to Sannomiya about a half hour after landing. \n\nJAL operates a number of different planes and configurations for these domestic short haul flights.  Often the flight will be with a B767 or B787 with just standard seats often configured 2X4X2 so this flight with the much more luxurious Sky Suite was a pleasant surprise.",

I never take JAL and heard a lot about the Japanese airlines have great services. So I have a high expectation for that flight. \n(1) The Sakura Lounge in SFO it's only opens between 12:30 - 3:30pm. It's especially only open for services for the JAL passengers. It's quite small, the space between seats are bit narrow. It's OK. The foods they served are limited. The sushi is cold and the rice is hard. The fried chicken nugget do not taste good. Compared with the United Club lounge in Hong Kong it's much better. \n\n(2) On the flight - The plane model is 777-300, I choose a window seat. I don't like the design of that seat. It feel narrow, not much space to extra storage. I feel like I am sitting on a economy seat, just it have space to stretch my leg and able to convert into a flat bed. \nThe good is it has a very large screen but it's not a touch screen, need to use a wired remote control. The entertainment is OK have the latest Hollywood movies but most of them I already watched before. Also you can use the remote control to order the side foods anytime you like. \n\n(3) The service - of course the flight attendants did are excellent jobs for the services. I have no complaints. \n\n(4) The foods - I love Japanese foods so I choose the Japanese menu. I looked at the pictures of the foods they served it's very attractive and seems very delicious. Yes the foods they served exactly like the pictures I seen before but I am disappointed to the taste. It's quite mild and not much flavored. The meat are over cooked. So I want to say I didn't enjoy the foods it served.\nAfter the main dinner/meal. If you want some snacks or side meals, you need to order through the remote control, or you can have the flight attendant order for you. It's OK\n\nOverall it's good and acceptable with that flight. I am glad that ticket is FREE, I want to say if I have to pay I prefer some other airlines such as Cathy Pacific, China Airlines, or Singapore airlines .",

All phone numbers on their website rang out without an answer so my last resort is lining up in  2 hour long queue outside of their Tokyo office. Is this a first world airline  or not? I think not and would be very disinclined to fly with them again",

        "review_text": "Absolutely fuming with Japan airlines and would never recommend them to anyone. Booked through them as I thought they were a reputable airlines - how drastically this perception has changed. Came to Japan for the Rugby world cup and everything seemed sweet, unbeknownst to everyone a typhoon hit Japan and we knew things would be a little chaotic ( no fault of JA obs ), so we called JA to consult as to what to do with our trip. As our flight was to take off the day after the typhoon hit we were told that the flight would likely go ahead and that if we were not there for check-in we would not be given a new flight. As the chaos continued the only way to the airport was through a bus the day before, so we stupidly took this bus got to the airport and thought o well at least we will make our flights. \n\nWhere things get troublesome, is that not long after arriving to the airport we hear that the last bus to Tokyo city is leaving, but hey we check again and our flights are still scheduled. So we decide to stay, half hour after the last bus had left, we get and email our flights are canceled because of the connection issues between Tokyo and the airport, so now we are stranded in the airport and no way to leave all because we were told that had we not been there for check in we would have to buy another flight.\n\nWhere things get even worse, I've been trying for the last 6 hours to get though to anyone from Japan airlines to work our when our next flights will be, but hey all phone lines are not able to be REACHED AND Noone from JA is here. So instead of staying in a nice hotel we're stranded in an airport with no knowledge of when we can leave and no idea when our next flight is. Thanks JA you're definetly NOT recommended.\n\nCompletely understand this must be a chaotic time for you but wtf would you cancel your flights the momemmnts after the last chance for anyone to leave the airport. \n\nTheres still hope we may be able to get home without too much more unneeded stress, but hey I'm not holding my breathe.",

The seat in front was also a little further away, which just made the whole experience more pleasant.\n\nStaff were extremely polite, and the food beautifully presented.  \n\nFor the return flight, I had managed to get an economy plus ticket for the same price as my outgoing economy seat.  It's definitely worth looking at booking directly through their website.\n\nWhen I consider that I could have been stuck in a cramped JetStar flight for the same price with no food or entertainment included, I feel so happy that I came across Japan Airlines.  Will definitely fly with them again to Japan.",

        "departure": "Vancouver",
        "destination": "Tokyo",
        "type_of_route": "International",
        "review_text": "Prior to my flight on JAL from Vancouver to Narita, I opted to use the Cathay Pacific lounge instead of the Plaza Premium Lounge that JAL uses as the CX lounge is much nicer, is less crowded and has better food.  The lounge had lots of seating and was never very full during the hour or so that I was there.  CX has the noodle bar offering dim sum, wonton noodle soup and dan dan noodle made to order but they also always have a Western offering too.   It was chicken risotto today so I gave it a try, quite good tasting.  CX also has a cold buffet section with sandwiches, salads and desserts. \n\nMy JAL flight from Vancouver to Narita was operated with a B767-300 instead of the Dreamliner B787-800 that JAL has been using the last few years.  Whereas the Dreamliner was equipped with angle flatbed Shell Flat Neo seats in a 2X2X2 configuration, the B767 is much better equipped with the Sky Suite II fully horizontal flatbed seat in a 1X2X1 configuration.  I selected the window seat in row 2 as the window seats alternate by having a shelf next to you on the aisle side or next to you on the window side, and 2K is nicely situated right next to the window with a shelf between the seat and the aisle for more privacy and less disturbance from aisle traffic.  Row 1 by comparison would have the shelf on the window side putting distance between you and the window view. \n\nThere were only 6 rows of seats in business class for a total of 24 seats, with 4 empty seats on this flight. \n\nBoarding and pushback was on time, expertly and efficiently handled by JAL staff as usual. Flight time as reported by the captain was relatively long at 10 hours 15 min due to strong headwinds.  We ended up landing at 4:44 pm about 20 minutes late as a result.\n\nOnce in flight, I noticed the engine noise in the cabin was considerably louder than on the Dreamliner.  The air was also noticeably drier since the part carbon-composite Dreamliner is able to be pressurized to a lower altitude with more moisture in the air than the all metal B767.  The toilets were also smaller and less nice than on the Dreamliner, just regular old style toilets instead of the Japanese toilet spray equipped ones on the Dreamliner. \n\nOn the plus side, the Sky Suite II seats with their fully horizontal flat sleep position was much more comfortable for sleeping than the Dreamliner Shell Flat Neo seats, though when fully reclined, the bed position was quite narrow at the shoulder position.  Unlike the original Sky Suite seats, the side armrests/partitions on the Sky Suite II seat do not lower down when the seat is reclined to bed position so no extra width is provided in the bed position. \n\nThe Sky Suite II seat does have lots of little storage spaces - a good size one located on the shelf next to the seat and a small cubbyhole under the video screen for a phone or small tablet.  There is also a cubbyhole close to floor level for shoes. \n\nMeal service on this 2:05 pm departure afternoon flight was dinner after takeoff followed by a breakfast/snack about 2 hours before landing.  Food as always on JAL is delicious and beautiful to look at.  I selected the Japanese meal for both meals.  The hot entree at dinner was salmon and pork belly, with the pork belly particularly distinguishing itself in taste. Prior to the entree, a bento box style starter selection is served with 5 different selections.  Dessert was coconut pudding with peach sauce.  As always, I finished with coffee as JAL serves a special coffee in business class only in flight and it is delicious. \n\nFor the second meal prior to arrival, the Japanese selection was grilled rockfish with rice.\n\nService as always on JAL is gracious and attentive.  When I mentioned I always have the special coffee served on board, the flight attendant kindly offered a pack of the coffee brewpack for me to take home to enjoy. \n\nThe entertainment system had a good selection of recent Hollywood movie as well as a number of Japanese and Asian movies. \n\nI am not a big fan of Narita airport as it is always too busy.  After landing, I made my way to passport control for my connecting flight and was lucky to be a few steps quicker as the line became much longer a couple of minutes after I joined it.  Fortunately the line moved quite efficiently so it was about a 15 minute wait to get through immigration.  My luggage was already on the carousel by the time I reached baggage claim and a few minutes later, I was through customs and into the arrivals hall at about 5:21 pm, a bit more than half an hour after landing.",

Going to India and serving beef as an option is culturally clueless I\u2019d say. And this is the second time that\u2019s happened on this leg.

Both flights were on time. The, all female, cabin crew were very welcoming and attentive and all spoke English. The seating is 2-2-2  and we had the middle two both ways. The seats are very comfortable, lie flat (of course) and with all the usual facilities. The entertainment package is comprehensive with a good choice of new movies.\nThe absolute stand out is the food! There is a choice of Japanese or Western cuisine: go Japanese. It is beautifully presented and exquisitely tasty. You'd struggle to get a better meal in a quality restaurant. My partner had the Western menu on the return flight and it was similarly delicious.\nAs an interesting aside, the flight crew have taken taken taciturn to a new level. On the flight out there was a curt \"crew seats for landing\": on the return, not a peep. Not a problem for me - I'm glad they're concentrating on flying the plane.\nIf you ever have the option of flying JAL, take it. I have flown Business Class with almost every airline and this is one of the very best.",

        "review_text": "Conclusion :  Instead of giving people trying to make an international check in a run around, open more desks.  JAL has numerous agents running around giving you advise (their way of telling you what to do) - and their response when REFUSED (which is rather amusingly obvious that a REFUSAL is not what they want when they are trying to  tell you what to do in a suggestive manner).  Only one agent here that handles international flight so go wait for the four desks to open 45 minutes later.  We were already second in lne - so why go where we have to wait 45 more minutes?\nWe had plans to have lunch at Itami, so heck with baby sitting the luggage for 45 minutes longer, plus more waiting.  What are all those agents with JAL lapel pins doing?  Open the damn desk at 11 instead.  Suggest to people standing at the back of the line to go elsewhere and wait some more.  \nThe reaction of the agent when I REFUSED to go was surprisingly unpleaseant when done full of smiles.  It was suggested several times that it would be quicker to wait until 1145 than to keep waiting where we were.  By the time the suggestions stopped, we were served and checked in at least an half an hour prior to the other check in desks opening.  Several families and unfortunate souls who tood the advise where all gathered waiting in line for a line that didn't open for another thirty minutes.\nIf they didn't like where I was waiting, just say so, and tell me to move.  Then I may have moved.  It was a suggestion, so I politely declined, the first couple of times, but when it is done for the third, fourth or fifth time, most people get irritated.  I am one of \"most\" people.  \nWhat I concluded was the airport manager for JAL at Itami must be an idiot.\nJust so you know, the business class to Japan on JAL - fine.  Business class NRT to PUS - fine.  Economy to NRT, economy to NRT-ITM - fine.  Gate and check in and transfer agents were fine.  Thus my conclusion of the idiot running the ITM ground agents.",

        "review_text": "I am very disappointed with JAL. It has ruined my first Japan trip/experience. We were set to depart 12am 10th September 2019 and because we heard about the typhoon that hit on 8th and ended on the 9th morning, on the very day of departure we even rang at 5pm to make sure our flight had not been cancelled/rescheduled  and we got the \u201cAll OK\u201d and happily we prepared and booked our transport to the airport for 9pm. Just as we were about to leave for the airport, we got an email saying it has been cancelled due \u201crotation caused by typhoon\u201d in the morning (bear in mind typhoon has left Japan by then). \n\nWe weren\u2019t given any further instruction on the email and the toll free reservation number put us on hold for an hour (we need to know when our re-scheduled flight will be postponed til) so we were forced to go to the airport (6 adults 2 babies and 1 children) and you can imagine the anxiety and confusion at that time!\n\nWhen we reached we were greeted with a bottle of water and a sandwich, we were then told to get a number and waited in line at 10pm. At just about 12:15am we were finally at the front of the queue and was told we didn\u2019t have much choice anymore and the the next flight would be on Philippines Airlines at 430am transiting in Manila for 3.5 hours. We asked if we could get a hotel just to freshen up while we wait for (bear in mind we booked JAL cause we hate transit flights to be then put in this situation is appalling!)\n\n1) Philippines Airline counter to be open at 230am\n2) Airport departure gate to be open at 330am\n\nBut we were declined that.\n\nWe were forced to wait with 2 crying babies (no sleep) on the floor in Tullamarine Airport. \n\nSubsequently we went to Manilla on a packed plane. JAL forgot to get us a bassinet for my Baby and we are forced in a role of 4 adults with no room for baby (my baby had not slept since 10pm the night before). That was so horrible for the 8 hours flight... you would think a mainstream airline would usually have bassinet for under 18 months olds but JAL forgot to book me that on the replacement flight!!!!\n\nThe following is not directly due to JAL\u2019s fault, more Phillipines Airlines/Manila Airport\u2019s incompetence, but JAL put us through this hell.\n\nWhen we reached Manila, and told them at immigration that we were transiting to Narita, they assumed (not sure why and what?) with Phillipines Airlines and took us straight to the transfer desk which is OUTSIDE the immigration hall - we even asked if we can collect our luggage first but was told not to worry at that stage. When we got to the transfer desk, they were shocked to find out our transfer was actually with JAL (the Manila - Tokyo leg) and they panicked after realising their mistake as by then we were outside restricted areas without of bags. They also refused our re-entry to collect our bags. And after 1 hour waiting/watching them panicking there, they finally offered to get our bags for us but came back 30 minutes saying they couldn\u2019t find our bags!!!!! We were forced to rush to another terminal (waited another 30 minutes for bus) without our bags and board the plane to Narita. \n\nWe got there late the next day and lost 2 days (1 day transiting/stuck in airports and 1 day having to buy clothes as we had NOTHING). We missed our tour to Gotemba and Mount Fuji as a result of this. \n\nWe were not offered any apologies whatsoever and when we flew back on 23rd, we asked nicely if we could get an upgrade or at least an apology at least if no compensation, we were only given a lame Sakura lounge entry which we only had less than 30 minutes to spend in there. \n\nI am very disappointed with how Japan Airlines treated us and how this has ruined our much anticipated trip that we booked 6 months ahead and has caused us all the stress and dramas. It was hardly a holiday thanks to you.",

        "review_text": "Japan Airlines (which I will refer to as JAL) is an amazing way to enter Japan from anywhere on the globe, with their very comfortable aircraft & amazing service. On my flight, check - in was very fast and efficient, with no line as there were many counters open for passengers. A diagram was shown of the Boeing 787 - 9, showing how half the cabin was for business passengers (surprisingly), and only 1 cabin was for economy passengers.\n\nThe boarding of JAL's aircraft is very fast and efficient, and was completed within a few minutes. However, despite the gate in Sydney being located right next to the food court, there is no seating directly at the gate, as it is shared slightly further away with 3 other gates, and at the time the morning flight departs, it can be hard to find seats. During boarding, economy & business class were boarded at the same time, and after the 'express' queue for business class ended, economy passengers were invited to use that queue too.\n\nRight after boarding, the very friendly cabin crew accounted for any dietary conditions, putting identification stickers on each seat which required them so the process would be smooth when the meals were to be served. From this moment, the experience felt very strongly Japanese, with the cabin crew taking a bow in the initial welcome. \n\nThe on - board bathrooms also were extremely spacious, has marble flooring & had toilet seat 'cleansing' functions straight from Japan. The toilets are some of the cleanest & most modern toilets I have ever seen on a plane, and the crew were constantly cleaning them!\n\nUnfortunately, apart from at meal times, beverage services were very sparse, and when they did exist, only one type of beverage was available. This meant that you were often very thirsty, and unless you wanted the particular drink being served, you would have to wait until the meal service. There were 2 meal services on this 8 hour flight, one after takeoff and one before landing. \n\nDue to the plane being a Boeing 787 - 9, the amount of legroom was massive! Also, according to a brochure in the seat - back pocket, it has been rated the best economy airline seat for 3 years in a row. However, the recline on the seat was a bit less than expected, and I couldn't fall asleep (however lots of other passengers could!).\n\nJAL was an amazing airline experience which I'd never expected, and I definitely would fly with them in the future.",

There was USB slot available to charge a device and a small Velcro pocket next to it in which you could hold the device, like a phone (Galaxy S10 5G). I didn't try the food on the flight to Japan or the way back but it seemed to be decent and the stewardess were extremely courteous. If I had one bad thing to say about the experience, it was that they turned the seat belt sign on way too early in my opinion. They had it on about 40 minutes before the plane landed. To be fair, I'm not sure if this is standard as I'm usually sleeping right until we land on other flights. All in all, I'd fly Japan Airlines again.",

The cost competitiveness of JAL (from Japan to Malaysia) is the best mostly. Food, entertainment, service, cleanliness, comfortability...etc.: most of them exeeds your expectation. The flight atendants are supportive and kind, which is not so common all over the world. If you travel with Business class from Japan to Malaysia, select JAL. It is worth. However, if you are tall and/or big, be careful a bit as the leg room is not that big. I am 175-180cm in height but rather heavy 90-95kg in weight, so I am big in some sense (I do not want to accept I am fat... hahaha) and felt leg room was a bit narrow. Except for that, mostly everything was excellent.",

My two sons and I were issued bulk head seats on the first leg which made for a comfortable journey to Tokyo. The staff were great, the cabin (including toilets) was kept spotless and the food was pretty good for those on a standard menu. My son is coeliac and his GF food was not as good due to some inedible fish.\n\nUpon booking we were informed that the incoming flight would land at Haneda and our outgoing flight was from Narita but it would be our personal responsibility to transfer across Tokyo. With a 5 hour layover we were informed that it was possible.\n\nAn hour passed by the time our flight landed late and it took a long time to clear customs at Haneda. Upon exiting we discovered that there we no spaces left for the transfer bus leaving in the next 10 minutes and would have to wait 1hr20mins for the next bus. This journey takes approx one hour.\n\nWe opted for the 'Express Train' option between the two airports, however, I'm not sure why 'express' is used at it stopped at all but a few stations, went through the Tokyo subway system and took almost two hours! The strangest part of the process was the requirement to purchase the tickets using cash rather than credit card which necessitated an ATM withdrawal.\n\nI think we arrived a few minutes earlier than had we waited for the next bus but my children enjoyed seeing Tokyo from the subway and it was an easy door-to-door journey if long. This flight was chosen as we were using points and didn't have much choice. I wouldn't pay and willingly choose this flight route.",

I would recommend JAL hands down for food. The only fault was the plane was uncomfortably hot. No one likes to feel like they are short of breath- that was the only fault- cabins that are too hot.",

At 5.50pm, we were noticed that the flight was cancelled due to the typhoon. And no one lead us, just was told to go the transfer counter, and line up there to get help. The lobby were filled up with passengers since all flights were cancelled at that time, no any slot attendent was out to arrange the lines, no any decided for lines, so the lines was messed. Asked the customer service if they had any arrangement for us, they tried to avoid the answer, kept telling us lining up. After lined up for about 3 hrs, was told to group together whoever had the same destinations,so we got pulled out from the line and asked us to wait in group. And we were waiting for another couple hours, the slot attendants decided to take pictures of our boarding passes. So we thought we would get to arranged another flight, so we waited for another 2 hours. I felt something wrong since no one came out let us know what happened, so caught a slot attendent, asked her what was going on. She told us should line up to get help, but not waiting in front their working area.... Or we could book another flight online, but we must pay for it. And I asked her about the boarding pass photos, she rejected that they took photos, so we ended up lining up again. And we have been in the airport 11 hours. No food, no any info, only a bottle of water. And they started sending out blankets around 4 am, but we had been here for whole night. Also, we were told if we were signed up for another flights, we must get out the airport grab our check in luggage and re-check in.... And no one told us the narita airport closed at night, so we couldn't even get out the airport to get a hotel and rest since immigration booth was closed....so eventually, we all got stuck at the airport, couldn't sleep, no food no drink.",

It turns out there was a problem because my husband couldn't input my updated family name on the JAL website when booking our flight so he ended up using my maiden name. When I called JAL, the customer service representative at JAL flatly told me that I could not possibly board our flight so I should just cancel my flight. I said this was impossible since we are traveling with our 8-month old baby. The CS rep from JAL then suggested we all just cancel our flights and book new flights (adding that it was going to be more expensive)!!! I was shocked that she couldn't suggest any other solution. Most airlines, to my knowledge, allow some name change especially if it's a problem with changes from maiden name to a compounded family name. But JAL was *completely inflexible* to even suggest just cancelling my entire family's flight. We are all packed and ready (imagine how difficult it is packing to travel with an 8-month old!!), we are booked at a hotel near Narita, and my husband is meant to participate in a conference the day after we arrive in Poland. But now all our plans ruined because JAL would not consider our situation. In the end we booked a flight with a different airline and we will be departing the day after tomorrow for Warsaw. I managed to contact JAL finally and asked to cancel our flight. The second CS rep we spoke to was somehow more helpful and tried to provide some other solution. Still the problem is that they absolutely do not allow name changes. THIS WHOLE FIASCO COST US MORE THAN 200,000 yen NOT TO MENTION the stress of preparing for an aborted long-haul flight with a baby. I've enjoyed the food and service onboard previous JAL flights when I was single but It was extremely upsetting to be told to just cancel all our flights when there wouldn't have been any problem in the first place if we did not have any trouble with JAL's website. I WILL DEFINITELY NOT FLY JAL AGAIN now that I have a family NOR DO I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE traveling with small children.",

For this particular trip, I booked a multi-city itinerary of New York - Seoul (with a stop at Haneda), Busan - Tokyo, Tokyo - New York. Normally, I fly ANA, but since ANA does not have a flight from Busan-Tokyo, I took JAL for the first time in several years. They did not disappoint. The seats feel wider than most U.S. airlines, staff is super helpful, service is impeccable, movie choices are adequate. Choose your seats quickly, especially if you are traveling as a group of two. The economy area had three-seat and four-seat rows, but very few two-seat rows.",

Recently I travelled on Japan Airlines to Tokyo Narita from Dallas, TX.  As an AA Platinum member (One World Sapphire) I have been lucky enough to have been upgraded occasionally on AA, but it's been a challenge on the partner airlines - specifically Cathay Pacific, Finnair and British Airways. I was already prepared for being told \"no\" when I asked about the possibility of a complimentary upgrade from standard economy.  I was pleasantly surprised when the agent smiled, thanked me for being a Sapphire member and handed me a boarding pass for their Premium Economy cabin.  \n\nThe seat was comfortable and came with a variety of creature comforts including an amenity kit, slippers, a large pillow, blanket and noise cancelling headphones.  I had more legroom than I needed and the footrest was a nice touch also.  The seat itself was quite wide, had a small privacy divider, a large seat-back screen, convenient storage spots for cell phone/glasses and the seat recline system was kind of cool in that the seat slid down and forward within it's own space, not bothering the person in back.  I was able to sleep reasonably well and felt pretty good upon landing after a 12 hour flight.  \n\nOverall, I was extremely impressed with the Premium Economy cabin and would certainly consider paying the price in the future.  Looking forward to flying on Japan Airlines again!",

In other airlines, after the first 2 hours you can see how much a bathroom is used during a flight because of the smell, spots and dirt on the floor and sink. In our 4 flights with JAL, from Chicago to Narita airport in Tokyo and from Tokyo to Bangkok and back, we didn\u2019t see a spot on the floor and there was a supply of toothpaste, toothbrush, mouthwash and hand lotion until the end of each flight. \nWe will continue flying with JAL, our favorite airline now!",

I would definitely recommend this airline to family and friends and to anyone traveling international.  I been traveling with them for 9 yes or so and counting! The attendants are very friendly also. I remember last year when I flew into Narita airport I was late picking up my luggage so when I went down to look for my luggage,there it was waiting for me at the Japan Airlines counter and the agents were holding it for me or keeping an eye on it for me! I thought that was so nice! When I went to pick it up the agents had a smile on their faces which made me feel at ease.  Also they are always on top of things when it comes down to safety too.this is a must for any airline that you travel with! I will definitely use them next yr again.",

Folks going to Aomori to take note that even though it looks direct, Aomori doesn't have a clearance counter so passengers have to alight in Tokyo and retrieve all luggages through immigration and then re-check in again for Aomori flight. \n\nSIn - tokyo haneda - aomori was smooth but seat arrangements was bad and the website didn't allow me to change designated seat at internet check in(this is free for all regular airlines i've travelled with before) resulting in middle seats for all 4 of my group. \n\nAomori - tokyo haneda - tokyo narita - sin - no mentioned that other than retrieval of luggages at haneda airport, passengers have to make their way from haneda airport to narita airport (no free transfer and the bus journey took 1 hour + costs ~3000 yen + you have to lug luggage from the belt to the bus and then back to narita airport to check in again).\n\nI booked a flight from sin - aomori - sin thinking that i don't have to lug luggages during the transit/transfer. it's the first time on a \"direct flight\" that i have to pay for transfer from airport to airport + there was no information on this upon purchase of ticket that this transfer is not included in ticket pricing. What's the point of buying JAL to travel direct from SIN to Aomori when it feels like it's 2 separate bookings? I could have bought SQ from SIN to tokyo and buy a domestic transfer to Aomori instead. then the shuttle transfer from haneda to narita on my own expense is something that's acceptable.",

        "review_text": "We actually flew with JAL twice in the past 6 months - both times business class.  On both occasions the actual flights were okay, but the ground service was difficult and frustrating.\nFor the the first flight (Melbourne - Osaka return in February)  I had trouble finding our flight on the mobile app and tried contacting their offices.  Well, that was just too difficult and frustrating.  Eventually everything worked out but it was unnecessarily frustrating and time consuming.   \nFor the second flight, (Melbourne - Madrid return) things got worse.  I booked a business class ticket online and the money was taken.  When I tried to confirm seats, I was told that on one sector there were no business class seats left and we were bumped to economy.  We were told that we'd be wait listed for business and if the business seats did not become available, we'd get a refund for that sector.  That wasn't very satisfactory.  I contacted JAL several times in the lead up to our trip and this information was repeated ... you are wait-listed and may have to apply for a refund.  48 hours before the flight, I received a phone call to say that we could have business class seats, however, because the tickets had to be re-issued, we had to pay additional charges.  Apart from being very annoyed at this new fee, I had to spend a considerable amount of time \"on hold\" whilst the process of re-issuing the ticket was \"managed\" by JAL.  Very unsatisfactory service and I really wouldn't risk flying with them again.",

The food on the flights were excellent, a full gourmet meal (including Haagen Dazs green tea ice cream) that was far better than anything I have had in economy since I flew on Pan Am.   And as a big man the seat belt was large enough to not need an extension.  I will fly JAL whenever I can from now on.",

The Amenities bag (contained toothpaste & toothbrush, ear plugs, moisture mask, steam eye mask, lip balm and tissues).  The remote control for the seat to be converted to a flatbed was easy to follow. \n\nEntertainment had a reasonably good selection of options with recent movies and TV series.\n\nThe menu had both a Japanese option and a Western option, but you couldn\u2019t mix the two \u2013 it was either one or the other \u2013 bit of a shame as there were dishes I would have liked to have tried on the Japanese menu.  The Western Menu Main meals were either Beef Cheeks or Ling Cod.  The Raspberry Mousse Cake had gold flakes in it which was interesting.  \n\nYou could also order Cheese, Fruit and Chocolate from the \u201cAnytime\u201d menu during the flight.  About 2 hours prior to our arrival we were served a meal - the Western Menu was Mushroom Frittata with a Croissant, Yogurt and fruit.\n\nThoroughly enjoyed the flight \u2013 our section of the Business Class only had 12 seats in such a huge space and the flight attendants were really friendly and caring. \n\nWouldn\u2019t hesitate in flying on Japan Airlines again.",

You are entering Japanese culture with a pretty good business class Japanese menu. The flight attendants are incredibly polite as you would expect. And, Japan Airlines, at least in business class to me is as good as any airline. I like the cabin configurations as well. Yes, there is more space in first class but quite frankly not enough to justify the price difference. Definitely recommended. The only downside is the rules based inflexibility of JAL. My kids were flying premium economy and they wouldn't allow them to come into the same airport lounge as my wife and I. They did have access to the basic international lounge so the 4 of us could only use that lounge to stay together.",

We had access to a lounge at DFW before our flight and at Narita between flights. This was welcomed especially for the 4 hour layover in Tokyo. It should be noted that Premium Economy on other airlines do not always include a lounge visit. The  787-9 is a great plane to fly on and my favorite since I feel better at the end of a flight. The seat is a recline in the shell so the seat in front of you will not encroach on your space. The legroom is ample. The food and on-board entertainment were fine. The room under the seat was a little limited. The cabin was warm so it was harder to sleep than it should have been. The amenities kit was nice. (The Points Guy has a review which included pictures of the seats, the amenity kit and the food in Premium Economy) Overall I would certainly fly JAL in Premium Economy in the future.",

Staff were very attentive, cheerful, and kind. Newer airbus model, roomier legroom, average size seat width, clean cabin and bathrooms. Boarding and disembarking were smoothly done and on time. I did not mind a long layover because all the resources available in Narita airport such as customs and immigration and hotel transports that make layovers a pleasant experience. My only beef with JAL is the food. It could be better but please do not take away the real cutleries and the ice cream cup-that\u2019s my favorite. Other than that, I\u2019ll fly JAL again and recommend it to friends.",

Free wine, Free Udon noodles, great in-flight entertainment (with noise-canceling headphones) and ample space. The seats recline super far, with a fold-down foot rest and flip up leg rest. The arm rests are quite wide, so you don't have to jostle with your neighbor for elbow room -- plus there's a partition at head level so you have a good amount of privacy. \n\nCouldn't be happier with the flight.

        "review_text": "In my many years of travel, never have i experience such great pain in doing a transit/transfer, international/domestic. While making the booking, the JAL system auto book us with a gap of 1.5 hours for a change to domestic plane in Haneda airport. Upon checking in, only did we learn that we have to clear full customs & baggage be taken out & check in again at domestic transfer counter - NO thru baggage into Sapporo. AND baggage will not be accepted at the transfer counter if you are later than 45mins to flight departure, then it has to be carried all the way to the domestic terminal & be checked in there. (Hair stands up in HORROR)\nArriving at Haneda, the passport clearance was miles long, it took full 45mins to clear, then we dash to the baggage area with the heart thumping all the way ...\nFound our baggage, run to find the transfer counter ...now its only 35 mins left, we see the staffs kept looking at their watches, trying to decide if they would accept the several poor souls on the que !! More heart thumping.. thank God they accepted the luggage, gave us the train tickets as it is too late to take the bus. We had to run, really run to find the train platform to catch the next train. At the domestic terminal, clearing the security was another mile long, by chance we saw the priority lane, we fought for attention of the staff & showed our boarding time is almost closing - they allowed us to join the priority que.. by the time we ran to the gate, its only 10mins left !!! Our heart was thumping endless !!\nWHAT A SUPER BIG PAIN, HOW COULD JAL ALLOWED THIS KIND OF CONNECTION in their TICKETING  & ALSO WHY DIDN'T provide sufficient upfront information eg baggage will not be checked thru etc .. to travellers !!!\n\nSame horror story on the way back - when trying to check in on- line, we realized tho it has a JL plane id, it was actually a code share under Jetstar. Means we can't check in on-line. At airport, Jetstar could not print the boarding pass for the 2nd lag on JAL. And Jetstar flight was delayed 35 mins !! Heart starts thumping again as we knew the nightmare with insufficient time to transfer. This round, its Narita - even bigger, more running, searching, right bus to right terminal etc and the running gets real stressful, clearing passport & security ... run, dash, run dash .. we arrive at the gate with the boarding started !!!!!\nThis is the nightmare that i thank God that i survived through, but do you want to put yourself through it ???  \nmy advise, AVOID THE PAIN, take those airlines that does direct flights into Sapporo & NOT JAL that has to transit / transfers to domestic flights in Tokyo. I don't understand why JAL process flow and design are NOT so traveller friendly",

I tried to protest but since I couldn't even get my shoe on, I didn't really have leg to stand on (pun intended). \nThey went back and called whoever was in charge and called ALL MY CONNECTING  FLIGHTS TO MINNEAPOLIS. LAX, to CHI to MSP. There were wheelchairs waiting at every gate, shuttle at LAX, cart in Chicago and in MSP. Talk about above and beyond! Who does that?! Japan Air, that's who. I had priority seating, they were very kind to me and the rest of my trip was made so much easier. Good thing too because my gate at LAX was 1/2 mile away. \nExtra bonus, we are vegan and the food is amazing as well as very pretty. \nFYI: I have never seen airline bathrooms this big, ever...ever.",

The kids were given a good quality welcome toy and the kids' meals were really cute. Throughout the flight, they will periodically offer water/juice without having to ask for it. The seats were comfy (slightly wider than usual) and they have snacks near the service counter for you in case you can't sleep and felt like munching something.

Because we had individual, compartmentalized seats that we could raise and lower partition screens, we had a true sense of privacy.  The seats reclined and raised in a variety of positions, so we never felt cramped or hemmed in.  On top of all this, the service was stellar.  The stewardesses were concerned for all of our needs and were extremely helpful: the best of any airline I have ever flown.  The food was exceptional and help was immediately available, regardless of the hour.  Additionally, access to the First Class lounge was included.  It was an amazing experience.  From check in through arrivals I could not have asked for kinder, better attention from everyone.  I consider the flight, especially one of this length, as a day of my trip.  I cannot imagine spending it in discomfort.",

Then because we were so super early, we were given coupons to their lounge. The lounge was stocked with snacks (even sushi for a bit) and all you can drink (including alcohol). Lounge was located above so there was a view for people watching. Once on the flight, staff regularly fed us with 2 meals, snacks and drinks. There were also a selection of movies and all the comforts were provided including headsets. Check to see if there is a food difference between economy and economy premium. If more leg room is necessary, weigh all that against cost difference.",

They said it was because of  weather in Beijing, I checked the weather in Beijing to Tokyo when she was flying and the weather was beautiful. But if there was weather problems that is not where my complaint is. She had to catch a connecting flight to her home town on a different carrier. So the delay caused her to miss that flight. They told her in Tokyo that they would take care of it ( very poor English) they should have better speaking English employees if they are going to fly from the U.S. So she got to Manila went to the ticketing counter of Japan Air to get another flight to her home town. Nope said they could not help her because it was not Japan air (they don't fly to her home town) I called Japan air while she was in Tokyo and they told me they would accommodate her. They also told her that an hour and a half connecting to Air Asia was not enough time to get there? That's irrelevant, however It's in the same terminal and it has only taken me 10 minutes to get there when we have done that trip before. So the guy at the counter said that he could get her a flight for $40 to her home town because they work with that airline. He went on the internet to find her one? $102 (I could have done that and cheaper) I spoke with him too, poor English and rude, like he did not care. So in the end she went to the Air Asia Terminal (took 10 minutes to get there) and had to buy another ticket that was 6 hours out and it took 2 hours for nothing at the Japan ticket counter. Lies, Lies, Lies. I will never fly on Japan airline.",

We had to change airports in Tokyo ie landed in Haneda & transfer to Narita.\nFine we knew there would be some disruption but we were not prepared for the complete lack of service from JAL! Upon check in at Heathrow we were assured that the transfer was common occurrence and would happen seamlessly, in fact there would be someone to meet the flight and aid us since we had to get through immigration & collect our bags considering we were business.\nThe check in at Heathrow wasn\u2019t professional & up to the standards of most font line International carriers ( they share veryl limited facilities with BA ).\nSo I boarded in London with some misgivings which I expressed to the purser. She allayed my fears stating the transfer was common practice & would radio ahead. So now the flight was great, food good, service excellent 11 hours of top class flight.\nDisembarked to find no one waiting for us, approached one attendant holding a little card & was told to go through immigration, collect our bags, go to the bus counter & buy a ticket for Narita. \nWHAT A BUN FIGHT .... it took an hour fifteen to get through the queue only to be told we were at the wrong counter! Half an hour later we got to the carousel to collect our bags. To their credit (our bags last to be collected) they had an attendant with the bags. I explained our predicament and was told to go through into the concourse and buy a bus ticket.\nNO ROOM ON THE BUS......FULL 2 & HALF HOURS LEFT  NO JAL STAFF WITHIN COOWEE.\nI had to leave my fianc\u00e9 (who was totally stressed) with the baggage & go upstairs to arrivals in order to attempt to sort out the situation.... NO HELP TOLD TO TAKE A TAXI.\nBy this stage our connecting flight was due to take off in just under 3 hours.\nTAXI DRIVER WAS GREAT HE REALISED THE GRAVITAS OF OUR SITUATION & SPED TO NARITA \nHe did what JAL should have done. Cost of cab AUD $370\nEventually got through, boarded to be told no Western food they had run out! Don\u2019t give me that sitting in 3D in a half empty business class .... no Western food came aboard..There is more but I\u2019ve bored you enough don\u2019t touch JAL  unless you\u2019re desperate.... good if nothing out of the ordinary happens but no backup .... a disgrace.

The business class seats are staggered...meaning you do not have to bother the person next to you when getting in and out of your seat.  The seats also flatten to a bed.  (A nice plus on a 15 hour flight!)  I was lucky enough to get a window seat.  The window seats are very private, especially when you raise the divider between you and the next seat.  The aisle seats in business class can feel a little busy with aisle traffic.  Both food and service were amazing.  I love that they have Asian and Western choices on the menu.  (I kinda tried them all!!...and they were all great!)  A lot of great choices for in-flight entertainment.  You have to pay for internet and it's not cheap.  There are also some great little amenities onboard.  I will definitely be flying with them again.",

The service was amazing, they serve 2 hot meals in the 10 hour flight, drink no cost, hot towels served before you get your meals, ect..... Another thing that is great is, the Japanese people and how they travel. Every time you get on an airplane with a bunch of Canadians and Americans in is a painful experience (I am Canadian). The Canadians and Americans don't know how to act, as soon as the flight is in the air they are standing up and digging in the overhead compartments, or letting their young kids run up and down the isles and walk around staring and invading others space. The movies on the flight were all free and all new releases with many to chose from. Getting on and off the plane was very organized. It was a very pleasant experience.",

When i finally connected i was treated as if i was stupid and badgered at for making sure my name was correct, i have screen shots and copies of my confirmations with correct spelling. Ive been waiting 4 days stressing over this whole ordeal. They cant manage to help ease this tension, it seems as if theyre so set on just waiting untill its too late to cancel where my fees will double! This whole time i havent been treated as a paying customer , but rather a criminal. I dont suggest using this airline at all, the inflight service could be good but i wouldnt know.

        "type_of_route": "International",
        "review_text": "I took the long haul flight from Tokyo Narita to San Diego on JAL 66.  I flew in from Bangkok and had a short connection time of one hour to make the flight scheduled for departure at 5:20 pm, but found that the San Diego flight was delayed as there had been a gate change from one end of the terminal to the other.  As a result, boarding was delayed and we pushed back about 15 minutes late.  There was a long wait for takeoff due to the many flights taking off from Narita at that time of the evening, and it was around 6:20 pm before we took off.  \n\nThe flight was operated using a B787-800.  On boarding, I was pleasantly surprised that the plane was outfitted with JAL's Sky Suite fully flat seats instead of the angled flat Shell Flat Neo seat that I expected based on Seatguru.  The Sky Suite seat is wonderful - not only does it convert to a fully flat bed, but there are also narrow shelves and counters all around the seat and little storage nooks here and there, plus storage under the legrest for a carry on bag.  \n\nMeal service on the flight was dinner, which was delayed and then service interrupted part way due to turbulence.  After the main meal was served, many snack or second meal options were available for any time service according to the menu - salad, JAL trademark curry, ramen or udon, sandwiches, cheeses, Japanese and Western set plates - the choices were too plentiful to sample even on a long haul flight.  For dinner, I had the Japanese meal, which featured seared Wagyu beef and grilled black cod.  Before the appetizers and main was served, there was also a really delicious amuse buche of sesame tofu with wasabi and sweet corn flan with sea urchin.  Cabin staff asked me whether I wanted to be woken for the second meal prior to arrival and I opted to be woken and ordered the Japanese plate with roast beef roll.  Eventhough both meals had miso soup, the two soups were very different ones, a thoughtful touch in variety.  As always, the meals on JAL were delicious and beautiful to behold.\n\nNotwithstanding a very turbulent flight with the seat belt sign turned on repeatedly, I managed several periods of good sleep of a couple of hours each.  JAL has added an airweave mattress pad for sleeping.  These were stored in the overhead bins and when I was ready to sleep, I unzipped the package and the pad folded out easily to cover the seat converted to a bed.  I thought the pad - probably about an inch thick - did make a difference in making the seat more comfortable as a bed.  \n\nDespite the delayed boarding from the change of gates and the long wait for takeoff due to Narita traffic, the flight arrived in San Diego only about 15 minutes late.  \n\nI enjoyed the flight very much and thought the many choices for any time dining after the main meal service and the airweave mattress pad which JAL has added made the flight even more enjoyable than prior long haul JAL flights I have taken.  Would love to repeat this long haul experience if flying on the same route again.",

        "review_text": "I took an early morning flight from Bangkok (Suvarnabhumi) to Tokyo Narita on Japan Airlines (booked as American Airlines AA8412).  As the flight is scheduled for 8:05 am, I arranged for a 5 am car from the Millennium Hilton Bangkok which arrived around 5:35 am due to the light traffic that early in the morning.  After a quick and courteous check in at the JAL First Class check in from my One World Alliance status, I used the priority security lane to quickly pass through passport control and was in JAL's Sakura lounge.  The lounge is very large and as JAL did not have many flights early in the morning, it was mostly empty.  There is a full buffet of food including Western eggs and sausage but also Japanese offerings like yellowtail and daikon, kelp in soy sauce, sweet potatoes, cooked jelly mountain vegetables, Japanese style buns stuffed with noodles and more.  (Not that I needed the food as the Millennium Hilton Bangkok thoughtfully put together a packed breakfast with ham and cheese sandwich, pastry breads, fruit and orange juice).  The lounge has a good view of the departure gates and the runway.  \n\nThe flight was operated using a B787-800, configured 2X2X2 in business class with angle flat seats (Shell Flat Neo).  We pushed back on time at 8:05 am.  Flight time was estimated to be 5  hours 35 minutes and we arrived on time at 4:18 pm.  \n\nMeal service was lunch shortly after take off and drink service.  I opted for the Japanese meal since I generally find the Japanese meals better than the Western ones on JAL.  I was not disappointed as the meal was delicious.  \n\nI found the angled flat seat actually quite comfortable for napping, and, as long as I positioned myself at the correct place on the angled flat seat, I did not slide down on the seat.  It is also relatively wide.  I had seat 1D, the first row, so I did not have the cabinet in front of me with the video monitor that other rows have and therefore it was very easy to exit from the seat.  Legroom was also very good in the first row.  The video monitor for first row seats has to be retrieved out of the armrest and is smaller than for the other rows.  However, the entertainment system for JAL is not its strongest point anyway so it did not bother me (JAL has a smaller range of English movie choices than other airlines and most of the movies in other languages have Japanese as a subtitle choice instead of English). \n\nAs always, service on Japan Airlines is superb and courteous, and the washrooms are kept very tidy by constant cleaning by the cabin crew.  \n\nOverall, no complaints and a very enjoyable early morning flight.",

I can't use the flight on the day it was booked, so now I have effectively paid $1,345 dollars for NOTHING.

Not just regular tenderloin, this was a legit Wagyu cut steak.  Fortunately I was able to eat mine, and then my kids already asleep, I had to suffer with their portions.  Didn't want the food to go to waste.  \nAnd the Yamazaki to wash it down was wonderful. \n\nI have another JAL flight booked next month, and I am very much looking forward to it!!",

This is the first time as a platinum frequent flyer of many years that I\u2019ve ever come across this and was severely disappointed. In addition, to add insult to injury, the stewardess singled me and my partner out to put our seats up (don\u2019t have any problem with this during the meal service, but they did not ask the couple in front of us to put their seats up, which left us cramped and squashed).

Given the schedule, I had two choices - the LCC Vanilla Air or JAL.  I am glad I chose JAL despite the slightly higher fare. \nBoarding started on time (to a remote stand via bus).  The flight was operated by an older 767-300ER, but it has been retrofitted with larger luggage overhead bins and JAL's award-winning \"SkyWider\" economy seats.  At 19-inch width and 94-inch pitch, these are probably the best economy seats in the industry in terms space and comfort.  The IFE is also stocked with plenty of movies and music. \nService is executed with traditional Japanese professionalism and precision.  I noticed some of the crew members were able to speak Mandarin to the Chinese passengers.  Not being a fan of airplane meals, the meal was actually quite good for economy class and it came with a small Haggandaz green tea ice cream!  I don't think you would find that on too many 4-hour regional flights. \nWe arrived at our destination on time.  Although I was quite tired from having just flown in from the US (and got virtually no sleep), I still found this JAL flight to be a pleasant one",

As far as Food is concerned,  there are predominantly two choices Japanese and Western on any flight. The Japanese is understandable and is mainly fish and see food. I am allergic to fish and seafood so can't eat it. The other option is western which is   Beef and Fish. Universally on all other airlines it is Chicken and Vegetarian. This shows how much knowledge the featured chef have of the world cuisine. Even on the flights to and from India, which had about 60% Indians, the menu was exactly the same. Most Indians don't eat Beef and lot of them are vegetarian, imagine what will they eat? All airlines cater to the local taste rather than forcing what they like.

Granted it was just a few hours, but you know you're having a great experience when you don't want the flight to end. It was my first time ever on a Dreamliner and I was glad it was on this airline. The aircraft (B787-9B) was squeaky clean, had a modern cabin with new window tinting technology, and 2-3-2 configuration. Legroom was wide, the seat (32K) was comfortable, the IFE screen was large with a good entertainment selection. Excellent service, quality, and efficiency were evident throughout the flight. Food was equally excellent as expected on a Japanese carrier.",

However I give the airline credit for making adjustments so that I could sit with my wife and 2 young children.  The flight was uneventful which is the best type of flight.  Flight attendants were friendly and professional.  They also gave our children JAL souvenirs which made them really happy.\n\nThe food wasn't bad.  I had fish which was moist and tasty.  The seats had plenty of legroom.  In-flight entertainment was all right but most of it was geared towards Japanese passengers.\n\nOverall I was glad to have flown with JAL and had a pleasant experience.",

Our feel is always the International flights are better than the Domestic ones overall, oops\u2026Nevertheless would like to share the most recent trip experience in late-May when we took JAL38 from SG to HND.\nA red-eye flight it is 7+ hours journey. The embarking and check-in was good, as other Airlines.  The takeoff was on time and orderly.  Inside the cabin the seat legroom and Aisle spacing was respectable, especially for us Asian.  But agreed with some TA reviewers that the inflight entertainment is only average.  Movies are ok, not too dated but the Audio is mainly Japanese and Korean.  If English be prepared for more selection of \u201coldies\u201d songs than contemporary.  The Chinese selection is minimal.  Though there is a personal entertainment screen/page the programs are all in Japanese..    \nMeal wise always something to look forward to.  It is probably in Japanese airlines that they serve warm miso soup, really refreshes us, beside the hot/cold green tea.\nJust like to highlight an incident that I believe speaks volume of their good customer service.  It was mid-way through the flight and light were off (resting time).  I was thirsty so I approached them for a warm water.  Minutes later the air stewardess came back with one, and with a lid cover over it!   Apparently worry that it will spill and/or ensuing the temperature will not drop so quick.  A small gesture but I take it very positively.!\nWe will continue taking JAL if the timing slot is good, and also believed all passengers will continue to receive attention and good service throughout their journey.   \uf04a",

When I looked at it, there was a stain on it, so I handed it back telling the staff that it was no longer needed.\n\nThen, after takeoff, it got quite chilly inside the cabin, so I requested a blanket again hoping that they wouldn\u2019t bring be the one with a stain this time.  Fortunately, they handed me a different blanket, I was very relieved, but when I took it in my hand, I smelled this horrible filthy smell...  at first, I tried using it just cover my legs, but i couldn\u2019t bare the smell. \n\nI just don\u2019t understand why they wouldn\u2019t notice this smell before handing out... it was disgusting and I so regretted touching it.\n\nAfter that, everything in the cabin seemed filthy and dirty and I felt very very uncomfortable.",

Bags get priority. GOOOOOOOOOOOOD!!!\n\nLounge Access LAX-  As a premium passenger you get lounge access at LAX but JAL does contract with a basic lounge provider at Tom Bradley.  Not as good as Norwegian Premium Economy passengers getting the One World Business lounge.    But the JAL Lounge at LAX is in my opinion way better than most Plaza Premium and Priority Pass Lounges I have been too around the world.  Also Virgin Atlantic PE passengers dont get a lounge and neither do AIR New Zealand passengers.  THE Los Angeles Lounge has some sandwiches, cup of noodles, snacks, a small outside seating area, good wife and BOOOOOOOOOOOZE.  Enjoy.  GOOD\n\nThe Lounge JAL contracts with at  Hong Kong is Qantas Business and this lounge is the BOMB.COM.  It is a very very very big, comfortable lounge.  Way better than any business lounge at LAX or SFO or JFK or Newark.  PE passengers on JAL get to use this lounge.  Amazing!  Food is good, alcohol selection is good (not as varied as One World lounge LAX) but the FOOD is way better than what they serve at LAX One World Business Lounge.\n\nThe Flagship Sakura Lounge NARITA-GOOOOOOOOOOOOOD  better than most US airlines international lounge and AA Admiral Club lounges.  AS PE you Get access. Food is good, booze is good.\n\nThe Seats-  42 inches of pitch Gooooooood.  Better than United PE, American, Virgin, all of ANA, some of Air New Zealand, most of cathay pacific fleet but not as generous as Norwegian (Norwegian offers 43 or 46 depending on the equipment flying) but the seat is very functional and spacious and you will have enough legroom.  The controversial thing about the seat is that it slides forward to recline rather than slides back.  Frankly for a premium economy product, nothing beats the recline on Norwegian PE seats and their pitch is good too.  So I was not a fan of the JAL recline but they make up for it in so many ways.\n\nJAL FA's:  They are the best in the world besides the gulf carriers.  They are prompt friendly and kind and willing to serve.\n\nThe Food:  You will NOT starve on a JAL PE Flight.  Snack after snack, Udon De Sky, Probably the best economy food offered in the sky (not enhanced food like Virgin or Air New Zeleand) but when you have lounge access you tend to have your meals at the lounge instead of eating on the flight unless your flying a solid business class like Qatar Airways or Turkish Airlines business catering.  Again for economy food it is pretty good..  Also you get Hagen Daz icecream and snack after snack after snack.  GOOOOOOOOOOOD.  My advice is EAT AT THE LOUNGE and if the food is good eat the airline meal.  But enjoy all the yummy snacks and Udon de Sky and the Hagen Daz\n\nOverall:  I will fly JAL again.  I normally fly business class when going overseas but when I am paying for 5 people and not traveling alone PE is the Way to go with JAL.",

In all my trips I have always had very good experience with the menu (you can choose between 2 options) and the combinations and flavors are of very good quality. And do not forget the appetizers that help you taste meals better. In one of my trips my suitcase broke down, and when I went to pick it up from the conveyor there was a person from the company waiting for me with the bad news, however they gave me at the time a new suitcase with the apologies of the case. Yes I don't change JAL for other.",

In stark contrast to Qantas staff, nothing was too much trouble, and they were constantly up and down the aisles with coffee, tea, green tea and water.\nUpon landing, staff were at the baggage carousel offering help and directions to anybody who needed it.\nI highly recommend JAL",

But a few days before her return flight, JAL cancelled her flight.  They told her I needed to go to the airport in the USA to show them the credit card I used to purchase the tickets.  Not is this a tremendous hassle, since the airport is not that close to me, but I don't even have enough time to go to the airport now before her return flight back, because this is so last minute, and I have to work.  And they also said that they won't issue any refunds for the ticket too.  I think they should at least refund half the price of the ticket; but actually should probably be the full price given the great hassle and inconvenience!  Now she had to buy a different last minute ticket to fly back to the Phillipines, and that ticket is very expensive.",

        "review_text": "I\u2019m not one to write a review unless it\u2019s incredible or atrocious. This experience was the latter. \n\nThis was the first time I flew Japan Airlines, after hearing about their amazing customer service experiences from my friends who live in Asia. Sadly, I have to say it was one of the greatest disappointments of my flying experience that I've had. \n\nMy luggage was damaged somewhere from JFK to KHH, via NRT. There was some type of oily liquid that was spilled on my black luggage, which I later discovered had seeped into my bag and ruined my clothes. Japan Airlines obviously knew about the spill, as my baggage came out onto the baggage claim carousel wrapped in a pink plastic bag. I didn't think anything of it, since I thought maybe they had covered it due to severe weather/rain. It also had a strong, foul smelling odor when I took it out of the plastic, but again, I just thought it may have been the plastic. Bag felt dry, and I couldn't see liquid damage since my bag is black. When I got to the hotel, I opened my bag to find my belongings soaked and stained in an awful smelling liquid. Photos and videos were taken immediately. I also washed my handbags and clothes as quickly as I could to prevent permanent damage. \n\nWe contacted Japan Airlines the next day and spoke to their customer service at Kaoshiung Airport. We submitted all my travel documents, the baggage tags and boarding pass, along with my photos and videos of damages. Even though they covered my luggage with plastic, they are refusing to accept fault. The only compensation they are willing to give me is a cheap replacement luggage that doesn't even compare to mine, and they refuse to take responsibility for my damaged hand bags and clothes. No dry cleaning; no allowance for clothing (which is frustrating since the majority of what I brought is now ruined and unwearable); and no compensation for the inconvenience they've caused.\n\nNeedless to say, Japan Airlines has lost my business. I would NEVER fly with them again. My biggest regret is that I could've saved $300 and flown with Cathay Pacific.",

The ticket was purchased via GoToGate travel - purchased on 4/3/2019 for travel beginning on 6/25/2019 at a cost of approximately $1200. \u00a0Unfortunately, after booking and upon inspection of her travel document, she discovered a typographical error in her first name. \u00a0On the ticket, her first name (four letters) has an extra letter (ii instead of i) rather than the correct spelling. We're not sure how this happened, and were quite surprised to see it.\n\nWe made repeated attempts to rectify this situation and get the typo corrected. \u00a0We contacted GoToGate by phone and email multiple times. \u00a0We contacted JAL by phone and email multiple times. \u00a0We drove to the airport in San Diego and asked for help at the JAL desk. \u00a0We contacted Alaska Air. \u00a0Though our efforts did receive some replies, none were satisfactory. \u00a0The typo remains on the ticket.\n\nGiven the fact that TSA or the Airline may stop her at Airport Security Screening, or stop her \u00a0from boarding the flight, she is not willing to use the ticket. \u00a0\n\nTherefore, we have requested a full refund for the amount of the ticket, minus an appropriate handling fee, so that her booking via Go To Gate on Alaska and JAL will available, and so that some other passenger may book travel on the seat.\n\nWe believe that the airline and the travel agency have a moral obligation and responsibility to serve customers to the best of their abilities, and to rectify this kind of situation. \u00a0Moreover, both the airline, the travel agency, and other customers stand to benefit by allowing the seat to be used by another customer.\n\nWe are aware of the airline policies and practices regarding refunds and changes, yet we believe certain situations are exceptional and require flexibility.  At this point, all we can do is chalk it up to corporate greed and feel a simmering anger over our loss.",

We flew the next day after the World Cup in Moscow. Thousands flew from Moscow, including to Tokyo, but why fly back? The flight, by the way, was not 100% loaded. We didn`t buy a ticket on The Japanese airlines website, but on the S-7 website, with which they are in code-share. It turned out cheaper than Aeroflot. As it is sung in the famous song: \"First of all planes, well and girls then\". As ANA, its the main competitor, the Japanese airlines used of Been -787 Dreamliner. We were already flying these planes with Nowegian Airlines in the United States. Despite the current skepticism about Boeing after two catastrophes with the 737 MAX, the Dreamliner is an excellent aircraft with best ergonomics and the notorious smart chameleon portholes. Now about girls. I mean flight attendants. They work great. Smart, sensitive. In short, a role model. There is a simple means to conquer air passengers on long-haul flights is to offer metal Cutlery. I don't know why it's so important, but it works! That on flights on Emirates, that on Japanese airlines. The food is excellent. Breakfast and dinner a sandwich with fruit for lunch. The quality of food 4 and 5 star airlines Skytrax the food is about the same. Equally good. Wine. For some reason, almost always French. If you don't have enough, you can ask for another glass. The entertainment system is good. Movies, novelties and a little classics, games. In General, 9 hours passed unnoticed. The best praise can not come up for long-haul flights.",

I waited for food for the plane as I knew in business it would be better and was definitly good choice.  Since it was about lunch and I knew I was sleeping immediatly after I went with the western and actually had fish on the plane for first time and was excellent as was the service.  I had the first window seat behind first class and was really private the way the seats are designed so zero disturbance throughout the flight.  Downsides to the seat are that it gets a bit hot as the port side of the plane gets full sun blasting for about half the flight at altitude and for my 191cm frame it was just a tiny bit short.  Otherwise everything else was great and will certainly repeat in the future.",

Maybe it was a mistake on my part to not order a special meal, but I thought because they had chicken on the flight, which I ordered while booking things would be ok. The second flight we ordered a special meal for our 3 year old and they gave it away. They tried to give her a replacement meal of unhealthy and snack that consisted of peanuts, which she could not eat. When we told them no, they came back with baby food.",

Plus no delay checking into our hotel.\nThe price was very reasonable, the flight both ways on time, the staff efficient and we were able to move seats on both flights to bulkhead seats.\nMovie selection was adequate to a 9.5 hour flight, food ok with reasonable drinks offerings.\nWould definitely recommend.",

The seats were roomy and had tons of legroom. The aircraft was a 787-9 which was quiet and felt less claustrophobic than most planes I\u2019ve flown on. The seats reclined in a way where the seat back didn\u2019t jam into the person behind you. Meals were good and there were snacks and drinks available throughout the flight. Crew was very friendly and happy to do anything to accommodate passengers. I was very concerned about what I\u2019d do for 14 hours on a plane but the flight went by quickly. The direct flight from BOS to NRT is a fantastic route and seems very popular.",

Usually this wouldn\u2019t worry me but considering the flight is overnight, I would prefer to rest without worrying about disturbing the person next to me.

        "review_text": "While the cabin is starting to show it's age, and is not as fancy as the new First Class Suites that are popping up, this product is still amazing.\n\nThe suite itself, while door-less, is very private. I was traveling with a partner, and found it quite easy to talk to each other, but with the partitions raised, I cannot see her at all.\n\nThe seat is roomy, and for a 6foot, 250lb guy, I had plenty of space to toss and turn and sleep. And JAL still provides a mattress pads with the choice of firm or soft.\n\nThe service is top notch, the cabin crew were all super friendly, and was available immediately as soon as you needed them, but at no point did they feel intrusive.\n\nThe food is one of the true highlights of the flight. This meal would be great even if it was at a restaurant on the ground. My favorite dish was the tuna, which was made with fresh high grade O-toro. It was so good, I ordered 2 plates.\n\nI slept for majority of the flight so I could not try all the food, but everything we did have was delicious.\n\nThis F cabin does have the seatbelt on the ottoman which means couples could dine together. Although it is a little awkward as the person sitting on the ottoman has their back leaning on the TV, but other than that, it was fun to be able to dine with your significant other on the plane.\n\nMy small gripe is that JAL no longer serves Dean Deluca ice cream in first, and now it's just haagen daaz which seems too \"plain\" for First class imo.\n\nThe amenities kit is now by Etro, (it was loewe last time I flew with JAL) and for ladies a CDP face mask was given, while men got the Shiseido grooming kit, I opted to get the CDP facemask for myself as well, as men can also appreciate a good face mask.\n\nThe PJs offered is now unbranded, the old ones had a JAL logo, I found these new PJs to be much softer than before, and are very comfortable. They fit big, the Large actually for me when I am usually a XXL in street clothes. \n\nOverall JAL still offers a super amazing First Class with good seats, great service and amazing food.",

This was the JAL Skysuite 3. Power points, privacy, good screen and a comfortable lie flat bed I got a good 5 hours sleep on.\n\nOverall a good product I will be very happy to use again.",

The biggest problem is the seats themselves - hard, uncomfortable, narrow. Not relaxing when sitting upright, and hard to sleep in. I don't understand why they are so narrow given the huge amount of space devoted to each seat.\n\nFood is substandard. The Japanese choices are unappetizing for a Western appetite, and the Western options are unimaginative and often not well prepared. \n\nOn the whole the cabin crew is excellent and gracious, but it doesn't make up for what is basically a very uncomfortable flight.\n\nGroundside, their lounges tend to be overcrowded with slow internet.

As well as myself, there was also a 12 month-old baby who also had special needs and no concern for either of us was shown. Only got water (after 16 hours!!) because I managed to finally convince younger JAL staff person to bring some as older man dismissive. I have had a number of health problems since as a direct result of the extended period without water and food and the stress caused by the attitude of JAL staff.",

Flight over to Tokyo was great with friendly service same as the return flight. The only criticism I have and was very dissappointed about is that on top of already big amount you are paying for business class you don't get free wifi. In this day and age you would think this would be automatically included. I flew with Qantas on a domestic flight in economy and it was free! Japan Airlines really need to look in to this especially in business class!",

Crew did not help with airweave mattress or anything, though they assisted Japanese passengers. Very disappointed at the discrimination on this flight.",

We were served two meals and a small snack during our 14 hours flight. The food was a bit salty but tasty. Also, several drink services. When there were no meals served, they set up a snack station where you are welcome to help yourself. I was allowed two free bags to check in, which is great! No one fought for overhear bin space, so there were bins that were actually empty. In flight entertainment was excellent. Saw 3-4 movies that I had been wanting to see (fairly new movies were available). Took a small nap or two and then we arrived.

        "review_text": "I flew on 10 April 2019 from Seattle to Tokyo and then Singapore, returning on 24 April on the reverse Singapore/Tokyo/Seattle route.  The Tokyo-Seattle route is a new one, launched on 31 March 2019. Business class was totally full on the Seattle/Tokyo/Seattle flights, maybe because of the attractive promotional fares that were nearly US$2,000 less than the equivalent business class fares with ANA and Singapore Airlines (SQ). This review is of the Tokyo-Seattle flight.\n\nThe Japanese reputation for efficiency was quickly undermined at check in and at the airports, Seattle as well as Tokyo, although Tokyo was noticeably slower. Everything seems to take longer than it should and longer than it does elsewhere. In Tokyo this was true of both check in and security - not because the hand baggage security screening is better or more thorough in Narita but just because it all moves slowly. \n\nI found the language barrier particularly noticeable on the ground and in the air. I say this as someone who has regularly flown Asian airlines such as Singapore Airlines, Cathay Pacific, China Eastern, China Southern, ANA. This is not a comment that comes from a lack of cultural sensitivity: I speak a number of languages and do not expect everyone to speak English. But the situation is different when considering international airlines services English-speaking routes where it can be anticipated that a significant proportion of the customers primarily speak English. In this context I found that many, perhaps most, JAL staff have a surprisingly poor command of English and are sometimes incomprehensible. Despite years of living in Asia and working with Asians, including Japanese, I found it almost impossible to understand the attendant at the check in desk in Tokyo; and the flight attendants were barely better.\n\nThe JAL flight attendants were all friendly and well-meaning, hospitable, and attentive to the point of intrusion. The famous Japanese service training is certainly evident in the air. \n\nThe food and wine were disappointing for business class. In comparison with other airlines serving these routes JAL is less good. Not bad, but not as good as others. Of course the standard is better than a US airline would be \u2013 nobody is ever going to suggest that United should get an award for its food and wine offerings, even in their ever-shrinking international first class. But I recall ANA as noticeably better, and SQ is significantly better on both food and wine, as well as on pretty much every other category.\n\nIt was unfortunate that my seat had a broken monitor/entertainment screen. I was informed of this at check in, twice at the gate and twice on board; but as the business class was full there was no alternative seat and therefore no solution. The compensation offered (it was quickly volunteered; I did not ask for it) was a JAL coupon for a discount on a future flight or 20,000 points for onboard purchases or15,000 JAL miles. These were not much use: the first two only apply if one intends to fly again with JAL and the third says the miles can only be credited to JAL\u2019s own mileage program, not to a program partner. And it may take two months for any compensation to be mailed to one\u2019s address. 10 hours is a long flight with no entertainment available.\n\nAs is standard these days, the seat becomes a flat bed. I found it hard and uncomfortable. At least plenty of [very soft] pillows are available \u2013 try getting an extra pillow on United!!\n\nMy conclusion: try ANA instead; better still, go with SQ.",

I noticed the difference right away with the color scheme plus the seats didn\u2019t seem to be as wide and leg room was less.  The in flight service was lacking as the flight attendants seldom passed through with water and juice for hydration. The past three years I\u2019ve flown SIA and the FA\u2019s would do the water service about every twenty minutes!   As with most carriers today, the food was mediocre, a notch below SIA, but above the others. I chose JAL this year for convenience, my home to takeoff, two hours, not having to go to SFO. I did have to pay about $400 more to save six or so hours.",

I would suggest a travel pillow for more comfort.\nLight supper, beer, sake, etc , are all available,  to help you sleep better. We land at the international terminal at Haneda. You will have to clear customs, retrieve your luggage, and check in at the domestic flight counter located in the International terminal. Then you go to the basement and catch the right bus to the domestic terminal. There are 2 types of bus service. One goes to where ANA uses and the other JAL. As you can see, this process takes time, and if your flight is delayed, you will need to rush. The domestic flight was smooth, and I would like to praise the JAL ground staff for arranging the next connecting flight for us, as I've missed the scheduled flight, because I forgot to adjust my watch, for the 1 hour time difference. \nThe return flight is from Osaka, Kansai, also transit Haneda. This sector is much better, as our luggage were automatically transfer to the international flight.\nAs the flight from Kansai also lands at the Haneda domestic terminal, you still have to take the bus to the International terminal. Duration of bus ride is about 15 mins, but sometimes due to aircraft movements,  the Tower may halt all vehicles movements.\nOverall great flight, good experience,  nice Japanese politeness and food.",

The flight attendants were very attentive and polite, even reminding the people in front of you to put the seats upright during meal service. The Tokyo/Shanghai legs used older 787-8 models and the seats were noticeably more narrow with less leg room, but the service was still on par with the other leg of the trip. The only concerns I had were the cabin being a little warm and the seat pad wearing down after a couple hours in. On a 10+ hour flight that can become a little uncomfortable.

Even though sitting down for 12 hours with only little bathroom breaks may sound impossible, Jal makes it possible by adding more space to your seat, and improving the material used for the seats. Also, they\u2019re rated number one in economy class seats on Skytrax. Last of all their service is really good. Whenever I wanted a drink, they would bring it to me without any hassle. Wherever you go on Japan Airlines, you for sure want to fly it again.",

We asked again for seats next to each other, but only middle seats in rows behind each others were available. We took them, but didn't get a new boarding pass. On to security with another long waiting line. While scanning our mobile boarding passes, staff told us that these are not valid, so we had to wait till a Jal agent brought finally paper based boarding passes. On the plane no announcement in English, just Japanese which we found odd. Not the service we expect from a Japanese company",

The flights were super comfortable in the awesome Boeing 787 Dreamliner and there were sufficient leg room even in economy. Announcements were made in both Japanese and English. The touch screen entertainment systems were easy to operate and there were more than sufficient movies from fairly recent ones to oldies to keep all of us entertained.  The meals were very good and creative and out of the box - for one of the meals, JAL had winners and finalists of the Red U-35 chef competition in Japan create their in flight meals and they were really delicious and gourmet. For another meal, they had MOS Burger (a famous Japanese burger joint) create a burger meal.  These were arguably the best airlines food I ever had. JAL will definitely be a top choice airline the next time we fly internationally.",

The meals were all excellent with options for both Japanese and western menus.  I opted for the Japanese menu and was delighted with the options presented so masterfully.  The opportunity to sleep was afforded with the lie flat herringbone seat.  Of the 8 hours I slept for nearly 6 hours very comfortably.  The crew was outstanding from boarding to deplaning in Jakarta.  Would fly JAL again anytime and anywhere they fly!",

They were extremely helpful and put me on standby for the next available flight from a different airport (since the original flight was not to be rescheduled for a few days later) they even managed to get two seats next to each other! So amidst the disastrous conditions of having a multi-day snow storm almost end my entire trip, JAL saved the day. The flight was delightful (which is saying a lot since it was 14+ hours). Lots of movies to choose from, attentive flight attendants, and comfortable seating. I will be booking my next trip to Japan with them.",

Unless you have the window seat you do not have much privacy. The Sky Suite design has the side of the seat wide open to the aisle. I think the center might be preferable to aisle because there is a separate entry area and you have partition walls between seats. The food on this flight was horrible. The plane seemed very dated and it felt like the air was not able to circulate. I was in 8th row and the smell of the bathroom was evident throughout the entire flight. Further back seemed better on that front. In flight entertainment was a very dated system with few offerings. The screens in business are quite large but that meant you were more subject to light from movies watched in other seats despite the partition walls.",

        "review_text": "Flight departed on time at 6 pm. Boarding was orderly and there was a sign to indicate JAL's boarding priority. JAL & One World elite members board first followed by Business Class passengers who don't belong to the first group. There is no First Class service on this flight.\n\nThere is no pre-take off beverage service. When FAs were released from their seats, they came by to take meal and beverage orders. There is a printed menu laid out on the table during boarding. Choice of Japanese or Western meal. I chose the Japanese meal since the flight was out of Japan. \n\nThe seats, arranged in a herringbone placement are comfortable, however, they are not that wide. Window seats have a little extra space on the triangular tabletop by the window. There is not very much storage space for your belongings. Magazines and instruction cards are placed in very thin pocket on the wall below the tabletop. Can't put anything thicker than magazines in it. Items placed on the tabletop are not secured and will slide around during turbulence. There is a tiny locker in the wall above the tabletop at shoulder level. It's triangular space is not very usable and is adequate to store the headsets provided. They are over the ear headsets, though not noise cancelling. I didn't use them. Amenity kit had eye shields, socks and toothbrush of disposable quality. Had to put my belongings in the foot well to ensure they didn't slide around.\n\nThere is an extendable arm rest on the aisle side. It must be retracted (stowed) during taxi, takeoff and landing. When extended there is a small storage box below. Not much use due to triangular shape and unusable when arm rest is required to be stowed.\n\nMovie selection was quite good and includes Japanese selections. New Release movies were adequate though not as extensive as other airlines. I was tired and watched only one movie. \n\nJapanese meal was adequate; disappointing for something coming from Tokyo. The starters were served in a flimsy Bento box. Numerous one to two bite items that were tasty. Main course was served after the Bento box was cleared. It was disappointing - rice served with stir fried beef which was of meager portions and not particularly flavorful. \n\nDessert was served after table was cleared. It was nothing memorable. I remember much better meals served before the airline went through re-organization.\n\nLie flat seat was quite comfortable. You have to adjust the lumbar support to make it totally flat otherwise you will feel the bumps. Despite that, I could feel the joints in the seat cushions. It needs a bed pad to cover up the joints. Had to adjust my sleeping position so that my hips would not come in contact with the joints as they were a source of discomfort. The blanket was quite thick and I perhaps should have used it as a bed pad.    \n\nFAs were attentive when you press the call button. Surprisingly, they did not hand out bottled water at the beginning of the flight. I had to ask for it. It was supplied on my outbound flight. Snacks were available on request - choice of Ramen, Soba or Udon instant noodles. Nothing terribly exiting and I didn't need it. Slept the rest of the flight. Ice cream served as pre-arrival snack.\n\nOverall, the flight and service was good - not outstanding.",

I sat next to a Japanese lady on my return flight and the attendant switched languages when asking which meal I preferred. I found it very impressive. \n\nThe meals were good! They made sure to have 2 options, one more Asian and one more western. However, the sides always included something Japanese. I thought it was a great touch. Sample some lesser known Japanese treats while on board. \n\nThey handed out some rice cracker snacks and ice cream. The drinks available included some JAL exclusive wine which tasted good. Had a chance to taste both because my bf ordered red and I had white.\n\nThe seats were comfortable. They provided a small pillow and blanket, very much appreciated. It had a wire in the head rest that could be used to stop your head from rolling too far. I liked that a lot. Not sure if that's a standard feature for all full airlines. \n\nEntertainment was good. The movies weren't too old and being able to see some Japanese movies was cool. ;)",

        "review_text": "We recently flew from Dallas, TX to Tokyo, Japan on a flight with JAL. The flight one way was approx 12-13 hours. We were in the economy class and were concerned we should have upgraded our seats due to the length of the flight. \n\nTo our pleasant surprise, our seats were very comfortable (able to lean back) as well as having a monitor (installed in the headrest in front of you) stocked with numerous movies, tv shows, and games to keep you entertained during the flight. You were also provided a neck pillow as well as a blanket; both items were sealed and located in your seat upon arrival. The seats themselves were spacious (to be economy) and there was plenty of leg room. Also, the overhead bins were spacious and held our carry-on sized backpacks easily. \n\nThe flight attendants were very nice and accommodating. Due to the length of the flight, numerous meals, snacks, and drinks were provided. You were given a choice on entree (or main dish) of some of the meals; the food was surprisingly good! The food was served accordingly - heated dishes remained hot and chilled dishes remained cold upon being served. You were also given silverware with each meal. The attendants returned promptly to remove items upon completion. \n\nAlso, the one thing I forgot to pack was my headphones. To my surprise, the flight attendants came around at the beginning of the flight and asked everyone if they needed a set of earbuds!! While these were not expensive earbuds, they worked perfectly and were conveniently free of charge. \n\nI have no complaints of our flight to or from Japan and would highly recommend JAL to anyone.",

I chose economy but it felt like business class (what more if I opted for business class). The entertainment available during the flight will surely keep you entertained the whole flight. Their movie selection had recent movies (I watched \u201cThe Greatest Showman\u201d, \u201cTomb Raider\u201d, \u201cA Star is Born\u201d, and \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d). They also had movies from other countries and Japan of course. Music and other sorts of entertainment was available but wasn\u2019t able to really explore them since I was busy watching and eating. Yes, EATING! The food in JAL was really good, it was delicious. Overall, JAL for me is one of the best decisions I ever made. I have already recommended JAL to my family and friends, and for sure I will fly with JAL on my next Japan trip.",

The checking counterstaff in San Diego and Manila were so accomodating. Thje flight itself left on time, our flight attendants were friendly and attentive. Food selection is okey, I wish there more westernise choice. Public announcements were little bit long because they were announced in Japanese and English. Wish they annouce it in English first. The plane  was clean on all flighs. The legrooms between Tokyo and San Diego were little cramped compared to Tokyo and Manila flights. Overall great service, on time flights and short layover between connecting flights.",

        "type_of_route": "International",
        "review_text": "Check in at Frankfurt was nice and easy. Checked out the Sakura lounge which is well stocked with snacks, drinks and everything else you\u2019d expect from an airline lounge. The lounge is however very small and is also used by almost every other Oneworld Alliance member so finding a seat was challenging. Staff were excellent though.\n\nBoarding was smooth. The seats are pretty nice with everyone in business class getting aisle access. The footrest area is wider than some other business class products, but I noticed that in lie-flat mode, it was a tight fit and I\u2019m only a shade under 5\u201910. A small glass of champagne was served in a plastic glass. It really was two gulps worth and was a little bit underwhelming. A hot towel was given, and then take-off procedures started.\n\nOnce in the air the staff came to take drink and dinner orders. The menu was in Japanese, German, and English. The FA\u2019s English wasn\u2019t great and she kept trying to refer me to the German menu despite me wanting to turn the page to the English menu at the back. We went back and forth on this for a while until she realized that she had made a mistake and that the English menu page was not the pre-landing menu. I ordered a German Chardonnay which was very nice and the \u201cwestern meal.\u201d\n\n Like ANA, JAL have a Japanese or western option. I\u2019m not a huge fan of simple binary options like this because they do tend to be...very simple. Not being a fan of Japanese cuisine I had to choose the Western option which, like the Japanese option, was very seafood heavy which is something I struggle to eat. The first two courses were a shrimp and corn potage amuse bouch\u00e9e followed by a raw salmon and quail egg entree. I can handle shrimp but the singular shrimp was a bit dry. The corn potage just wasn\u2019t my thing. Since I can\u2019t stand salmon in any form, or quail eggs for that matter, I asked the flight attendant if I could skip that course after explaining that I couldn\u2019t eat that. She agreed. I guess it would\u2019ve been nice to have been offered anything as an alternative, but there were some nice German breads served, so it wasn\u2019t too bad. A few minutes later my entree of salmon and quail eggs was delivered to me anyway. Later, the flight attendant remembered that I didn\u2019t want this and cleared my table and delivered the main course, veal, straight away. The veal fillet was very nice. Again, quite small with only a token slice of red and yellow pepper. The desert was a small slice of chocolate and raspberry cake. Again, very small, but very nice. \nAll in all, dinner tasted very nice but I felt like I hadn\u2019t eaten much at all. I was pretty tired and just went to sleep soon after.\n\nStaff lay out a mattress for sleeping and it was pretty comfy. I got about 4 and a half hours light sleep. The on demand service meant that the cabin was quite busy and noisy all night though so I was waking up quite a bit throughout the night. \n\nBreakfast was scheduled shortly after I woke up and again, it was a Japanese or western option. The western option this time was an omelette and sausage with a crossaint, jam, and some yogurt. The omelette and sausage was pretty bland and again, quite small. The single croissant and jam were nothing to write home about and the yogurt was a tiny cup with two desert spoons full of plain yogurt with a little bit of fruit syrup for taste. Nothing special at all and I can honestly say I\u2019ve had better economy class breakfasts than this.\n\nAll in all, a pleasant experience that neither disappointed nor stood out. I thought the food was \u201cokay\u201d but the servings were very small. I think the lack of choice that Japanese carriers offer is a big sticking point for me. Japanese carriers are very \u201cone size fits all\u201d in their approach to dining. If you don\u2019t like Japanese food, then you only have one other option, and if you don\u2019t like what\u2019s offered in that, you\u2019re out of luck. My time living in Japan has taught me that Japanese customers tend to enjoy fancy branding and products. The menu was proudly advertised as being designed by award winning Japanese chefs and this is a great selling point for the average Japanese customer. On the other hand, non-Japanese tend to be not so concerned with branding and image. For me, I like options, and neither JAL or ANA are very good in that respect.\n\nStaff were pleasant, but were \u201cjust there.\u201d Again, it\u2019s what I\u2019ve come to expect in Japan. They were very good at their prescribed job and only performed the minimal level of service but we\u2019re a bit cold and impersonal. There were no personal greetings or farewells and they didn\u2019t call you by name. I find it\u2019s little touches like this that really make a business class experience for me. My business class flight on Thai a few months back was good for this. Staff knew your name and came to check on you regularly. Even Air New Zealand\u2019s premium economy had a far more personal level of service than JAL\u2019s business class. JAL lacked that little something extra here.\n\nInflight entertainment was pretty good overall and the large screen was very nice. Controls were a little slow but nothing unusual.\n\nI\u2019d give JAL a 7 out of ten on this flight. A good base level product but it did feel like bare bones service.",

        "type_of_route": "North Asia",
        "review_text": "I had an early morning flight on JAL 712 from Singapore to Narita.  I arrived at Changi Airport Terminal 1 around 6 am for my 8:20 am flight.  The terminal operates a Premier Check In Lounge for business class/first class passengers for multiple airlines located behind Row 4 instead of the JAL regular check in at Row 11.  I had a connecting flight at Narita on JAL on a separate booking but after a phone call to check with JAL, staff at the Premier Check In Lounge were able to confirm they can check me in for both flights.  There were probably 6 or 8 check in stations in the Premier Check In Lounge of which only about 3 were in use so there was no wait to check in, but I found check in staff was a little slow in checking me in, probably because they check in for multiple airlines rather than being dedicated staff for JAL as I am used to for JAL flights. \n\nThe lounge leads directly into passport control (security check is at the gate) and I was quickly into the dnata Terminal 1 lounge which JAL uses at Singapore (JAL does not have its own lounge and so uses the third party dnata lounge which also serves a number of other airlines).  The lounge had lots of seating and a fairly wide selection of hot and cold food for breakfast including Chinese shrimp dumplings and BBQ pork buns, fried vermicelli noodle, sausages and egg, three kinds of sandwiches etc.  I tried the BBQ pork bun and the vermicelli noodle and both were a bit hard and dried out, probably having sat out too long.  On a brighter note though, the lounge had a barista making specialty coffees to order and it was pretty good.  Wifi was inconsistent in the lounge - I kept losing the signal and often found it easier to connect to the internet on the Changi Airport free wifi rather than on the dnata lounge wifi.  \n\nI went to the gate a bit early as security check was conducted at the gate but there was not much of a line up and security check was quick.  There was a slight delay to boarding at 8:05 am instead of the scheduled 7:50 am due to aircraft cabin preparation and pushback was also a bit late at 8:30 am instead of the scheduled 8:20 am but we made up the time in flight and landed at 3:50 pm ahead of scheduled arrival at 4:05 pm.  Perhaps because of the slightly early arrival, I was slightly disappointed to discover that on arrival, we had a remote stand and had to walk down the stairs to buses to take us to the terminal.  I was connecting to another JAL flight and had lots of time to connect so the slight additional delay on arrival was not a concern for me. \n \nThe flight was operated using a B777-200 aircraft fitted out with the Sky Suite III fully flatbed seat in business class.  Each seat had direct aisle access in a 1-2-1 configuration.   I found the seat to be quite comfortable but rather inflexible in operation (table lifted up and angled toward you but difficult to use except in fully upright seat position, seat recline button covers entire recline function with no separate button for top of seat and leg rest so one could not, for example, raise the legrest in an upright seat position). \n\nIn flight meal was excellent as usual.  I selected the Japanese meal as they always seem more substantial and more interesting than the Western meal options.  Service is as always courteous and excellent and the washrooms were maintained in a very good condition by constant cleaning by the flight attendants.  \n\nAll in all, a very pleasant flight.",

        "departure": "Tokyo",
        "destination": "Singapore",
        "type_of_route": "Southeast Asia",
        "review_text": "Flying out of Haneda to Singapore, I arrive quite early around 8 am for my 10:50 am flight.  Using First Class check in and priority security line, I was quickly into the JAL First Class lounge at Haneda.  At around 8:30 am, the lounge was very busy and almost all the tables and seats in the dining area were occupied but most had cleared out by around 9:30 am.  Food offerings for breakfast were fairly standard - sausages, eggs, hash brown, grilled mackerel, two soups (lobster soup, potato an scallop soup).  There was a chef making pancakes with strawberry or caramel sauce to order.  Set up, decor and food offerings were pretty much the same as the First Class lounge in Narita however one area where Haneda clearly has the lead is in the washrooms - in the men's toilet, twice as many toilet stalls as Narita First Class lounge for a similar sized lounge. \n\nThe flight to Singapore was operated using a B777-200 equipped with JAL's top level Sky Suite III fully flatbed seats with direct aisle access from each seat in a 1-2-1 configuration.  The seat is quite comfortable and has a small side locker to store the headsets and other small items.  The table is a bit awkward as you pull it up and swing it towards you but there is not a lot of flexibility in how to position it.  Similarly the seat simply reclines back down to a bed or straightens back up to an upright seat and there is no option to individually control the seat back and the leg support portion of the seat (ie. you cannot raise the leg support without reclining).  Also once the seat is partially reclined, it is very difficult to get out of the seat so you have to raise the seat back almost to fully upright position before you can easily get up and go out.  Similarly, the table does not work well if the seat is reclined so you pretty much have to have the seat fully upright to use the table for eating.  There is a fixed armrest on one side of the seat that does not move so when you recline to a fully flat bed, you actually have to fit your arm under the fixed armrest in the space between it and the seat/bed.  Because of this, I found the seat a bit narrow when in a bed configuration but there was plenty of length.   \n\nShortly after take off, we were served drinks and lunch.  As usual, food offerings on JAL are delicious and visually appealing.  Having had many Japanese meals on JAL recently and seeing an interesting Western offering, I opted for the Western meal with Wagyu beef sirloin steak with foie gras sauce with a bit of oxtail on the side.  The beef was very tender and the oxtail wonderfully stewed and flavourful.  The starter was interesting too - Moroccan style abalone salad. \n\nPrior to landing, Chinese rice dumplings were offered.  This is literally a ball of rice wrapped in leaves and steamed so not much of a snack.  Therefore, I opted to also have one of the instant noodles, with udon, soba or shrimp flavoured noodle on offer.  \nService as always on JAL was courteous and excellent - no airline's flight attendants are as meticulous about cleaning out its toilets as frequently!\n\nOur flight arrived a bit early but as it was still around 5 pm/late afternoon, passport control on arrivals was very busy.  The line-ups for passport control basically occupied the whole of the arrivals lobby and backed up almost to the escalators leading down to the arrivals lobby.  It took about 25 minutes to get through passport control and by the time I arrived at my hotel on Orchard road by taxi, it was about 2 hours after landing. \n\nThe JAL flight to Singapore was very comfortable, with excellent food and service.",

We left JFK on time and arrived to Narita International airport about 30 early, excellent service, especially from Reith, one of the many flight attendants who took excellent care of us.  Premium economy is worth the extra money, but realistically after 14hrs, few things are still comfortable.   \nOur flight from Narita to Hanoi, was also excellent.  \nLounge service at JFK (Alitalia\u2019s for some reason) while dated (think 70\u2019s), was clean and offered snacks and drinks.  The lounge in Tokyo (Sakura) was fantastic and very efficient, offered buffet-style meals, snacks and drinks.\nGreat experience.",

        "review_text": "Recently flew with JAL from Tokyo to Vancouver, in business class. This was an overnight flight. The check in was very easy and all staff members were friendly and helpful. Language was not an issue. \n\nThe Sakura lounge located about 10 mins (walk) from the gate  was large and had a selection of food and drinks available. The lounge was clean and tidy and a good place to rest before the flight.\n\nOnboard the staff were very friendly and helpful and I quickly settled in. I was surprised that Business class is using an old side by side seat layout. It is good if you are wanting to conduct business or as a couple. But if you are sleeping you had to climb over the person next to you to go to the bathroom The seats turned into a bed, although it wasn't a flat bed and you slept on an angle. I found this annoying as there are other competitors who offer lie flat beds in their business class. This was an overnight flight and I was looking forward to a good rest.\n\nThe food and drinks selection offered both Japanese and alternate selections. Both meals were delicious. There was a snack bar near the rear of the section where passengers could choose what they wanted. There was also mini-meals that the attendants could prepare for if required.\n\nThe entertainment was good with a selection of movies, both new releases and old favourites. The inflight progress maps were limited and I was surprised that there wasn't an external camera to view the takeoff or landing. Maybe this model of B787 didn't have such cameras.\n\nOverall the flight was smooth and the staff very helpful, friendly and welcoming.",

So of course, since the flight is actually operated by JAL, Garuda Airlines is basically useless after taking the money.\n\nSo after I had to check in online at the JAL website with my e-ticket number (since the Garuda booking reference connects to nothing), I conclude my business in Jakarta and head to the airport to do some work in the lounge before my flight. Since it was a codeshare flight I was not able to get a boarding pass online. Well... apparently, JAL cannot be bothered with having a person or a kiosk to print a simple boarding pass. After I finally walked to various counters and kiosks, I called JAL customer service and was informed there are no kiosk for JAL at CGK and a person would not be there until 2 hours before the flight\u2019s departure time. So here I sit for the next 3 hours on the checkin side of the airport where it\u2019s hot, humid and there\u2019s no where to even plug in. Not to mention I\u2019m here with hundreds of people trying share limited seating. At least I had some time to type out this review. \n\nShame on you JAL!! How hard would it be for 1 kiosk to print a lousy boarding pass!!",

It was a great experience flying with JAL. The only thing I would suggest them to improve in providing Halal food for muslim. Personally I did write a remarks during purchase the flight ticket and i guess it was not put enough attention to the crew and the team who preparing it (they did serve non-halal to us which we have to asked and there is no replacement to it except salad :) ). Overall it's a good experience flying with JAL!",

The seats were comfortable but you were locked into a a rigid space; you can't move the arm rests and as I was traveling with a young daughter, it was not what we wanted. She had to sleep separate from me and it was hard for me to move as I slept. Economy was better in that respect. Otherwise, all was good, although the food when it did come was hardly spectacular.",

The service is the same with the economy class, but you do not need services for 1-2 hours domestic flight. Having extra space and comfort with only 10 USD additional is a great value for those who travel frequently within Japan. regardless of travel class of the ticket, if seats are available at the airport you can upgrade by paying the surcharge.

        "review_text": "I took a very early morning flight on Japan Airlines at 7:50 am from Nagoya (Chubu International) to Tokyo Haneda.  I chose to fly as booked more than a month in advance, it was cheaper to fly than to take the train.\n\nFor early arrival at the airport, the train was the only option as the limousine bus does not operate early enough.  I took the first limited express from Nagoya station at 6 am which arrived at 6:30 at Nagoya airport.  The train was completely full since it was the first fast train of the day to the airport. \n\nOn arrival at the airport, it was a short and well-signed walk to the domestic check-in.  Again, as it was the start of the flights for the morning, there were line-ups at every check-in counter for economy, business and first class.  I used the First Class check in based on One World Emerald status and after a short wait for the 4 or so guests in front of me, was met with the usual friendly courteous JAL service.  \n\nAs it was a domestic flight, no Japan Airlines own brand Sakura lounge was available and instead JAL offered the Centrair domestic lounge, a third party operated lounge used by a number of different airlines including both JAL and ANA.  The lounge was really nothing more than a place to seat with an offering of some basic soft drinks, coffee and a little alcohol, but that is pretty much as expected for a domestic lounge. \n\nThe flight was scheduled for 7:50 am and boarded as scheduled at 7:30 am. The flight was operated using a B737-800 configured in J-Class (ie. domestic business class) in a 2X3 configuration.  I was in the aisle seat on the 2 side.  All seats were full in J-class for the morning flight.  Seats were reclining seats with a little recline only but for a short flight, that was fine.  I was quite tired and therefore napped through the entire 1 hour flight.  There might have been a drink service but I would have napped throught it.\n\nThe flight arrived on time and luggage delivery was quick, with the luggage coming out shortly after I arrived at the baggage reclaim hall.  One thing to note is that the arrival time of 8:50 am meant that by the time I exited the airport and caught the limousine bus at 9:20 am, it was rush hour so the expressway out of the airport was more like a parking lot than an expressway.  Nevertheless, I was able to reach Shinjuku station by around 10 am.",

        "review_text": "We were flying from Tokyo to Okinawa in February. We had originally booked all of our flights using a travel agent in Maryland. We went from Guam to Tokyo, Tokyo to Misawa, Misawa to Tokyo, Tokyo to Okinawa, Okinawa to Guam. From this listing you can see we were traveling a lot in Japan. Japan Airlines had been fine thus far until this flight. There were 3 of us traveling 1 went first, no issues. Then we were helped by two other staff. They first gave us one figure for our luggage overage. Then they tried again and gave us another figure for the overage. Then there was an issue because our flight was originally booked in America which made it International even if we were flying from Haneda Airport to Okinawa which is a domestic destination. They took our money then told us they needed to have the back office clear our reservations and I guess our money too. The they told us to go out of the line and wait on the side until the back office could verify our reservations and our money. We asked how long we would be waiting and they said 15 minutes, we said no. Why are we not getting our boarding passes and change for the bags. We gave them yen. Well they kept leaving the counter and asking us to leave. Finally we asked for a supervisor for assistance. 10 minutes later a supervisor appeared with still another amount for our excess baggage and our boarding passes and our change. She just kept saying so sorry, so sorry. No real explanation of what the hold up was about or why the difference in the pricing for the excess baggage. I do know when JAL does screw up they screw up big time. No explanation, it took us over 40 minutes to check in. We probably would have still been standing there had we not asked for a supervisor. Really then we took the flight and really they cater to their Japanese speaking clients on these domestic flights. Explanation in English but no written signs in English.\nHappy to get to Okinawa and happier that my flight to Guam will be with United and not JAL. I would be leary of flying JAL if you flight was originally booked in America and your are flying out of  Haneda to another part of Japan.",

Sydney check in was  good and well managed , the return Tokyo check in was perfect , Sydney being Sydney the snowboards had to be taken to oversized baggage counter after weighing our luggage, however at Narita they just went straight through with the rest of our bags.. The 46 kilo checked luggage allowance ( 2 by 23 kilo bags ) plus carry on is double that of Qantas and much appreciated when taking snowboards , boots , apres boots ,ski jackets etc and there was no extra charge for the oversized luggage . The plane itself was near brand new , the seats comfortable, for economy seats , ample leg room ,good entertainment system and wide choice of what to watch . Inflight service was excellent, meals offered were good and the Fight Attendants attentive and helpful. To sum it up it was a typical Japanese experience, efficient , on time ( in fact early on the return leg ) and exactly what you paid for .",

So while JAL is great the BA service and treatment on the ground is a disaster.  Now some will say that the solution is to go through immigration and back in through the First Wing of Terminal 5, after Brexit that will not be a solution unless immigration controls as as today.  This will make transfers at Heathrow unviable.  It is a pity for JAL with a fabulous service and product to have it devalued by BA no longer paying for the Fast Track security for Terminal 5 transfers. (same problem a week ago transferring through Heathrow to a BA connection from Africa).",

Only two classes of seats, economy and first class. No good options here.\nFood, crew, cleanliness and everything else was wonderful. Just a miserable ride.",

        "type_of_route": "International",
        "review_text": "I took an end of January JAL flight from Vancouver to Tokyo Narita and was surprised at how empty business class was - I counted the front section of the B787 where I was seated (seat 1K, right side first row window) and about half the seats were empty.  Therefore, almost every passenger had an empty seat beside them and with 3 toilets for business class, there was always an available toilet with no wait.  The flight was punctual as is reliably common for JAL, and service and food was excellent.  I selected the Japanese meal for the first meal (lunch) as I find generally the Japanese meal is better than the Western choices on JAL, the starter bento box provides an always interesting combination of many different small bites, and overall the Japanese meal seems more substantial than the Western meal choices.  The main is always two meat/chicken/fish with rice and pickles and this time, it was fish and chicken.  \n\nFor the second meal, a smaller snack before arrival, I selected the Western set as the Japanese meal did not seem particularly interesting and was surprised when the flight attendant came back to advise me they were out of the Western meal and whether I would take the Japanese meal instead.  I reluctantly agreed and probably frowned as a minute later, she returned to advise that another passenger had agreed to switch their meal choice and she would be able to serve the Western meal to me after all.  I was glad as the Western meal was very delicious, particularly the mango citrus slaw and the soft fresh rolls.\n\nI noticed JAL was serving two Junmai Daiginjo sakes on the flight so I asked to try one, expecting to be poured a small cup for tasting.  Instead I was given a whole small 180 ml bottle, which was very nicely full bodied but much more than I could drink.  \n\nThe usual complaint about the 2X2X2 layout and no direct aisle access for window seats in the B787 Dreamliner used by JAL for this route did not apply this time as the half empty plane meant I had an empty seat beside me so no effort to step over another passenger.  The angle flat seat is still not as good for sleeping as a fully horizontal flat seatbed, but I did note JAL has introduced a new dense foam pillow instead of the previous soft fill pillow and it was much more supportive. \n\nBeing in the first row, I had the smaller pull out from the armrest screen instead of the larger screens in the other rows which have the screens on the back of the previous row, but I always thought the smaller screen was a good trade off for a window seat that has much easier step over access if there is a passenger in the aisle seat and because JAL does not have as broad a selection of movies as Cathay Pacific or British Airways, for example, by comparison.  But I was a bit surprised JAL had Bohemian Rhapsody playing on the flight whereas a Cathay Pacific flight I took on the next day did not have it yet.\n\nChecking on future planned travel, I discovered that JAL will be switching to a B767 on the route during the peak season starting in early June and that the plane will be equipped with JAL's much nicer fully flat Sky Suite II with direct aisle access for all seats.  However the trade off appears to be price as flights in early June to around mid-October seem to be priced around the $4,900 range round trip instead of the current $3,400 or so.",

The flight from Narita to Frankfurt is of high appeal to me as I do not like night flying and with a departure out of Narita around 11.00am local time and arrival into Frankfurt at 5.30pm local time and flying over the beauty of Northern Russia, it is a fantastic flight.  Similiarly, the return flight from Frankfurt is 50% daylight with a 7.30pm departure out of FRA and afternoon arrival into NRT.  The ongoing service, in flight catering, and on board facilities of the Boeing Dreamliner 900 series is fantastic.  The only failure was the JAL lounge at Frankfurt which is definitely not up to JAL standards.  The venue, catering and the environment is none different to a school classroom. Needs a major overhaul.  we look forward to flying same route with JAL again next year.",

Good customer services means assisting the customer \u2013 this was not the case. A very unsatisfactory outcome.",

I had booked the tickets using Webjet and then choose our seats by visiting the JAL website after consulting Seat Guru.  I would have liked to see the price for Premium Economy but this was not an option on Webjet ( it may have been out of our budget anyway!).\nAs my son and husband are quite tall I prebooked aisle seats for them, the seat configuration on our flights were 2 4 2 so we had one seat behind the other in order to get the aisle. The seats seem to be slightly deeper and there seemed to be more elbow room due to the seat configuration. Don't get me wrong it is not Premium Economy though! But we were comfortable.\nFrom check in to boarding and landing the customer service was spot on. The plane left on time with no delays. The flight to Tokyo was an over nighter and we were given a snack bag and then breakfast close to arrival. On the flight home from Tokyo to Melbourne we had a flight during the day and we were served lunch and dinner.  There was a good offering of movies and entertainment which was easy to access.\nWe were very impressed with JAL and will definitely fly with them again.",

We loved the SkyKiwi drink, and were so please that we could opt for that along with a glass of wine and a cup of hot green tea after our meal.  In flight entertainment was awesome, and especially on our second flight when we had a newer plane with their extra-wide economy seats we were SO comfortable.  One of our best flights ever.  They gave us blankets even for the short haul flights, and the little things like cup holders and extra compartments in the seat back really made for an enjoyable flight.

I liked the goodie bag, they even had noice canceling head phones, which was so helpful for a 14 hour flight. The crew was so kind and kept the lavatories clean, where they left toothbrushes after dinner. I appreciated their food, that\u2019s what tickled me most. The mid flight snack was noodles! Look at the pic! Airplanes on the noodle or veg (couldn\u2019t figure that out). Japan Airlines lounge was nice I pigged out there too. Again the crew was great at all three airports.",

There are so many amazing business class flights to choose from. Its sad that for the extra money I paid they still don't value the customer. Needs serious improvements!\n\nFood selection was poor.",

I was basically ignored and crew deferred to my husband (interesting as I bought the tickets and am the only one with OW elite status). I had to ring the call button multiple times and was not greeted with the typical Japanese high level of cabin service.

Worst flight of my life time, and My opinion JAL is worst Airline of all. \n\nAfter took off my flight JL773  Narita to Melbourne 10/01/2019 one hour later my two years old daughter was trow up, we both were all cover with vomit. Staffs only helped us by bought us some wet towels, but I did have to clean everything myself. I used my dirty top to cover the seat which still dirty with vomit. I know my daughter throw up so did try to not bother much for help. But my top covered with vomit so had to ask if they have spare top and they helped me with one cardigan. I did offer to buy this cardigan but she said is was OK, and I did plan to ask if how she want us to return this top. However no one offer to help and ask how about us, treat us like it was your fault u better leave with it. \n\nThen 2hours before landing, one Japaness Staff did come to ask my husband to return the cardigan because she need to do stock taking and want to make sure we return it. Then just 5 mins later another staff came to ask me to make sure we have to return the cardigan in 5mins! Really!!!, I never feel treated like this before, do u think we really need your logo cardigan that much!!!!! Do you really think we need to take it with us that bad, we did not want even wore it if my sweater was not full of vomit. All you care is the cardigan? What I going to wear? Have u ever care how well of my daughter? Have u ever came and ask how she feel? Why did she throw up? Not even once you came and ask how my family are doing alright? She is only 2!!! What you care is only the one cheap cardigan which have your logo on the chest, who want to ware that! We return your cardigan straight away. That show me enough if something ever happened JAL staffs will definitely worry about their belonging more than passengers. Sorry this matter also shows me enough about what is JAL airline main focus is and I will make sure will not travel with you again! Mark my word even we have free ticket I will not take it, that flight make me feel so bad, like I am a criminal try to steal your stuff. I did pay for nearly $16,000 for my family and all my staffs to travel with Japan Airlines and let me tell you worst decision ever. This trip is worst trip of my lifetime thank to you. And I will make sure i will pass this message to everyone I know to not use Japan Airlines again in the future. Because if accidents happen they will not care! No courtesy, no care, no customers service. Worst than budget airline. Food also bad. NOT and NEVER AGAIN!",

All the crews were informed, connecting flight from Nareda was totally full but everyone from ground to flight did they best to make it easier and comfortable for me. We appreciate all the extra effort and they did it with so much pleasure that I felt bad being such a burden. When we arrived in Singapore, this experience was different. All the arrangement was made but somehow the ground crews gave me the feeling that it was grudging meant to be. The disparity in attitudes were so great that I can only accord the attention and assistance received from Japan sectors were truely exceptional. I am flying next week for work alone, still needing assistance to move around, let\u2019s see if Singapore Airlines is as good as they claim. I will share again. \ud83d\ude03",

She said she knew we had a tight connection and rushed us through customs, grabbed our bags for us, and her and a couple other agents helped us navigate to our connecting flight.  They literally carried our bags and ran with us through the airport.  In the US, not only would we have missed our flight, but our bags definitely would not have made it.

Their dedication to ensuring that passengers had a comfortable flight was apparent from the moment we boarded until our departure and this was true on both our inbound and outgoing flight.  A pal who travelled first class said it was superior in all respects.  The food was light years better than the food I've experienced on other airlines, the bed was comfortable, the beverage selection was first rate and the flight was smooth and utterly painless.

Clean bathrooms, good food, impeccably dressed flight attendants, helpful flight attendants, pleasant flight attendants, comfortable seats, I could go on and on.  \nThis time I opted to try premium economy and was glad I did.  Not inexpensive but totally worth it.  Unlike US carriers that charge you extra just for a bit more leg room and nothing else (same way how they charge you for baggage) the premium economy seats are wider and have a crazy amount of leg room.  Premium economy also grants you access to the JAL lounge.  Excellent food and beverages.  Rather than eating at restaurants and their crazy prices at Honolulu Airport you're able to have a really nice meal and relax in comfort.  The Narita lounge is even nicer a bit better outfitted.  I'm not sure but the food spread also seemed to be a bit larger.  \nAll in all another fantastic experience on JAL.  Another reason why I'm flying less and less to the US mainland.  Why subject myself to the torture of flying US airlines when I can fly to Japan and have a great time?",

Alcohol is free on international flight. then two meal service and two more snacks. Pluse constant drinks. The food is really good, portions are standerd size.\nA tip, if you never flew an asian airline before , It's warm in the plane. to warm for me(around 80 digs,) but my wife was happy. \n.",

Some of the flights I was on had free Wifi while on other flights, I watched a few anime movies and read their selection of manga titles.  The premium economy class was slightly more comfortable with more legroom and amenities but I probably wouldn't choose that class over regular economy class if I had to pay for the tickets myself as regular economy was pretty good by itself.",

I am a bit of a snob and like to travel biz class but Cathay and JAL one world guys wanted ridicules prices for biz Hong Kong to HND RTN so went with premium economy. Over all I would fly them again but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth $1000 more then Economy the seats 18 were very comfy and would be great for long hall good entertainment and big screen. I\u2019m used to premium Econ on qantas which is a step just under biz this was just a step over Econ \n\nThe food was ok if you are into Japanese food and there was no pre flight drink and I had to ask for alcohol it wasn\u2019t offered. The flight attendants were very respectful and polite I could not fault them if I could put JAL flight attendants on Qantas flights that would be perfect. \n\nWe left a little late and the pilot was asking forgiveness and it wasn\u2019t his fault. We made up the time no worries at times we were traveling over 1180kph that\u2019s the fastest I\u2019ve ever travelled. \n\nSummary great crew and plane poor food  I would travel short or long hall without question just look for better prices. Thanks JAL for my intro to Japanese culture PS I loved seeing the ground crew bow to the plane and wave until we left",

Can hardly find couch seats. \nThe toilet in the flight to Tokyo is also bad. It smells of urine and it was only half way thru the flight.

I was shocked to find on the San Diego flight they use the old style 2-2 configuration and the seats don't go completely flat plus no privacy. I was very disappointed to say the least. For me it was not comfortable and will never go that route again. I actually felt cheated out of my money, especially for the same price I could have flown a nicer product out of LA. This was the first time I've flown JAL. It won't be the last either as the service was outstanding, probably the best I've experienced but I'll be much more careful in the future to do my research on which type of business class seats JAL is using on a particular flight.",

Itami airport is very close to Osaka city center so a quick half hour limousine bus ride was all that was needed to get to the airport.  Check in was quick and I used my One World Alliance status to access the Diamond Premier Lounge near gate 18.  Nothing fancg but there is a good amount of seating including lots of counter seating next to the small food area with a selection of a few bakery items to snack on in addition to offerings of drinks.  \n\nThe flight was operated on a B777 and I was in J Class which is domestic business class.  Nothing fancy here just regular seats with a slight recline configured 2-4-2.  I had an aisle seat next to the window seat but had unlimited legroom and no disturbance from my neighbour on access since we were on an exit row with no seats in front of us.  The flight was very busy and J Class appeared to be full.  Due to the short flight, there was time only for a quick drinks service which was efficiently done with the usual JAL grace and courtesy.  Flight was on time, luggage delivery was fairly quick and it was easy to reserve and board the limousine bus to connect from Haneda airport to Narita airport.",

My family and I were celebrating our anniversary and birthday on this trip. The Chief flight attendant, Maru (not sure if I got her name correctly), and her crew members were so incredibly thoughtful that they gave us special gifts and a handwritten card.

At that time I had called their customer service and received no satisfaction. Subsequently I went to their website and made a strongly worded complaint on their \"contact us\" form. This apparently went up a little higher, and I was informed that their gate agents would be notified of my need for an aisle seat. I was skeptical, but to my surprise I was not only given aisle seats, but preferred boarding, and treated with kid gloves by all their personnel. All four flights were on time, and my travel experience with JAL was excellent. If I had not complained repeatedly perhaps I would be less satisfied, but I have to say that they do take customer service issues seriously, and my actual experience on the flights could not have been much better. My last flight was only half full, and JAL still kept their schedule, in stark contrast to Garuda, which canceled two flights on me that had not filled, and caused some real headaches.",

The service was a little slow, but very Japanese \u2026 and delightful. It cannot be scored higher than four stars when benchmarked against other international business class flights taken in the past. It was expensive: JAL charges heavily because there are only four carriers who fly Tokyo-Sydney direct (JAL, ANA, Qantas and Jetstar which is effectively a Qantas subsidiary). There are other, much cheaper ways to fly to Europe if you do not have to go to Japan.",

On the ground, I had to have wheelchair assistance and JAL uses their own employees to meet and transport its wheelchair passengers with uniformed personnel that could be mistaken for inflight attendants.  They were friendly, spoke English perfectly and would not take a tip.  Best wheelchair service I have encountered.  Checkin was flawless and they actually came to me while I sat in the boarding area and asked me to board first; then, once at the plane they took my carryon luggage and stowed it for me; the flight attendant introduced herself and let me know if I needed anything to let her know.\n\nIn flight, service was again at a very high level with good food and very innovative - some a result of a chef competition that they held. I thought the Minestroni soup and small loaf of bread for breakfast was perfect and a great substitute for the usual breakfasts on airlines.  Seats were comfortable Recaro seats and inflight entertainment had an excellent choice of movies.  Coffee, tea and water were offered several times during the flight.  Some snacks were offered during flight in the flight attendant serving area but only rice crackers and some chocolate - this is the only aspect that I would rate as below average. The flight attendants were always available if one needed them and very cordial and attentive.  In Vancouver, I was again met at the gate by a JAL employee and transported by wheelchair all the way through Immigration and to my connecting area.\n\nOverall, I had two very impressive and comfortable flights.",

My dept flight to Chitose was ok, but my return flight from Chitose was chaotic because there was heavy snowfall when I reached Chitose airport and all flights were suspended. I would think such situations should be expected and managed in a more professional way.  The JAL staff at the Chitose airport cannot speak or understand english and that makes it worst. During such chaotic situations, especially for passengers like my group of 3 which is our 1st time encountering this, the Staff should at least provide some positive & substantial info and try to ease and calm the nervous passengers, but they did not.  I have to go from 1 JAL staff to another to get to an English speaking staff who can understand and converse with me.  In the end, I got a staff who was quite helpful and he speaks good english. Thank God we were able to get help from this particular staff and he managed to give us a standby tickets out of Chitose.",

So Jal economy seats tend to be a tiny bit wider. However the the distance between rows seems to be pretty tight. For some reason, I found the flight between Melbourne and Tokyo was much more comfortable than the flight between Tokyo and Vancouver. \nThe food and service were ok but nothing outstanding. Generally I would try to give the 787 a miss and find a more spacious aircraft if possible. Always check Seat Guru for seating plans.",

From Tokyo, we took at a 777-200.  Great leg room, tight on the shoulders.  Only 8 hours, so it was tolerable.  Looking to stay away from 787.  \nThe movie selection was pretty good.  Those and a book got me through.\n4 stars is solid - not JAL fault for the type of planes they fly.",

I had the most basic of economy seats. But everyone at JAL had me believing I was a valued customer.  Customer service was better than I expected. The seats were better than premium economy on delta/united.  The flying experience was better than I could ever recall flying the standard usa airlines.  I highly, highly recommend JAL",

        "review_text": "We had a very unpleasant experience on JAL, and my husband was ordered out of his premium economy seat.\n\nWe flew from Tokyo to Singapore on 29th November 2018 in a family of 3, my husband was on premium economy class as it was work travel while I and my daughter of 2.5yo were on economy. \n\nNormally on long flights, my husband and I would swap seat to take turn to look after our daughter. We have done this a few times on Singapore Airline and there was absolutely no issue. So today I took the premium economy seat first. After two hours I swapped my seat with my husband to put our daughter to sleep. However one of the stewardesses immediately ordered my husband out of the premium economy seat and said that no seat swapping allowed. We explained our situation and said that the seat rightfully belonged to my husband. We apologised and said we would not do it again. However she insisted that my husband must return to the economy seat. Now, at this time my daughter was over tired and refused to leave my side. So I sat down with her in economy while the stewardess pointed to an empty economy seat (far away from our seats) and said that he could sit there but not allowed back in premium economy. Afterwards my husband explained the situation to other stewardesses and they were very sympathetic, however they said that the person giving the order is the head steward and they have no say. They suggested that if we wanted to, we could file a complaint and so my husband did. \n\nA few hours later my daughter woke up from her nap. Although we tried asked her to sit with daddy and let mommy sit in the front she refused to and kept screaming I want my mommy. When I returned back to the premium economy seat she ran after me with tears streaming down her face asking for me. She looked so distraught that I lifted her up and let her sit on my laps and told her that she can\u2019t sit here. Almost immediately that stewardess came back and said to me your daughter is not allowed to sit here. I couldn\u2019t believe it as the stewardess looked like a mother herself, and how could she be so unkind and heartless to ordered a teary toddler right back to the seat. So I just looked at that lady and then carried my girl back to economy. I asked my husband to go back to the premium economy seat again as this is just absurd. He paid for the seat and yet ordered out of his own seat. So he did and that stewardess made a big fuss again. She even said to my husband \u201cI understand that you have filed a complaint about us and so have we. We know all your details and I have reported you to our airline\u201d. Now this is just ridiculous. My husband was firm but never lost his control or got too emotional. At that point he was so frustrated that he just left. And to make the matter worse the lady went to apologise to every single customer in the premium economy cabin because of our disturbance.\n\nIn the end, we spent the majority of our flight back in economy with the premium economy seat being left empty (as my daughter just wanted to be with me and I didn\u2019t want her to scream or cry on the plane and disturbed other passengers). \n\nOn top of that, we felt so humiliated and discriminated as if we were thieves from economy seat trying to steal a seat from premium economy. Had the crew members told us from the beginning that no seat swapping allowed, we would have definitely sat in the correct seating. We felt discriminated because in the same row of premium economy seat, one passenger kept swapping back and forth between business class and premium economy. He is a huge man and hence I noticed it when he walked down to sat next to his wife in premium economy. So that very man was allowed to go back and forth but not us? Later on when we complained about the differential treatment to the ground staff in Singapore, we were told because the man was on business class, he could switch however he wished to. And because we are on (lowly) premium economy, we are not allowed to do that???\n\nI really really liked JAL and would always have only good things to rave about this airline. However after this incident we are very scared by the airline and we are seriously want to avoid this airline forever.",

        "review_text": "Arrived at JAL First Class Lounge at Narita around 3:30 pm for my 6:40 pm flight and the lounge was not too busy.  However, by 4:30 pm, the lounge was packed and lounge staff had to make announcements apologizing for the condition of the lounge and asking guests to share tables.  This is becoming a frequent experience with the JAL First Class Lounge in the main building of Terminal 2 at Narita as the second floor of the lounge is closed for renovations thereby reducing seating significantly.  Having travelled through several times in the last couple of months, I have found the First Class Lounge often to be not relaxing and peaceful at all but instead over-crowded and difficult to find an empty table or seat.  It does fluctuate through the day so whether one will have a good experience in the lounge will depend on your luck.  The First Class Lounge in the satellite building may be better since it is not under renovation yet so if you are unsure of where your gate is, you may be better off going to the satellite building First Class Lounge instead of the main building First Class Lounge. \n\nI left a bit early for my gate as I know JAL is very prompt with boarding and as I have priority boarding with my One World status.  I was one of the first to board after the infants and assistance boardings and was quickly settled into seat 1K (window seat in the first row on the right hand side of the plane).  Business class was completely full on this flight so overhead bins were quite full.  This is particularly the case for the bins over row 1 since there are no bins over the two seats in the middle section of row 1 (2X2X2 configuration).   JAL uses a B787 Dreamliner on the route but installed Shell Flat Neo seats so it is not fully flat bed and the window seat passenger does not have direct aisle access.  However in row 1, there is no cabin with the entertainment system in front of your seat so it is much easier to step over the aisle seat passenger.  Window seats are also more attractive on the B787 than other planes because of the significantly larger windows giving views that would not be possible on another plane (eg. view more directly straight down below the plane). \n\nAs usual, JAL served great food on the plane.  Generally the Japanese meal is more substantial and more interesting and delicious than the Western offerings so I chose Japanese meal for my dinner and it was delicious starting with a bento box with 6 different starters, and then two mains served with rice.  I saw a salted chocolate dessert on the Western menu that sounded more interesting than the dessert offered with the Japanese meal, asked whether I could have the Western dessert instead and glad that this change was possible.  For the breakfast served 2 hours before landing, I opted for the Western meal for a change.  It was described as a salmon cake (more like a salmon patty) and turned out to be served with some nicely cooked pasta (not soggy!).  It was delicious and I was very happy with my choice. \n\nDespite the short 8 hour flight and the angle flat seats, I managed a good 4 hours of sleep as JAL was quite efficient with dinner service finishing about 2 hours after takeoff, and then also waking up the cabin 2 hours before landing for breakfast service.\n\nIn terms of weaknesses, JAL does not have a great entertainment system and the choice of movies is not very broad.  Other than Hollywood/English language movies, JAL does also offer movies from China, Vietnam, Thailand, India etc. but those only have subtitles in Japanese. English language movies though can be viewed in a number of different languages with subtitles in a number of languages.  A negative of row 1 seats is that instead of a large entertainment screen in a console cabinet in front of your seat, you have a small screen that pulls out of the center armrest.  The other weakness is that JAL does not provide any seat covers or other special bedding to improve sleep and the duvet that is provided is very light and not very long so a tall person will struggle to be fully covered. \n\nNevertheless I always highly recommend JAL business class as it is priced very well and the service and food are always excellent.  The washrooms are also in much better shape throughout the flight than with other airlines as cabin crew frequently tidy up the toilets after use.",

        "type_of_route": "International",
        "review_text": "I took the JL17 flight from Vancouver to Narita again, which I have done many times before, but this time encountered unusual boarding confusion at Vancouver.  There seemed to be people lined up and milling around the boarding pass reader lanes in all directions and JAL did not do as good a job of keeping things organized as they usually do.  That said, part of the problem may have been the unusally high number of passengers travelling with infants and young children, several wheel chair boardings and at least 15 seniors who needed assistance pre-boarding.  As a result of the boarding chaos, the plane was a bit late pushing off at around 1:13 pm, there was a long taxi with many planes ahead of us waiting for take-off so take-off was not until 1:39 pm or so, but nevertheless we landed around 4:18 pm slightly ahead of the scheduled landing time of 4:30 pm.  That is one thing that I have found in numerous flights on JAL - they tend to be very good on departing and arriving on time and punctuality is a trademark for the airline. \n\nThe flight was operated using a beautiful B787 Dreamliner but outfitted with angle-flat seats in the Neo Shell Flat Seat series.  I took seat 1K as the larger windows on the Dreamliner really make the window seats attractive and with no seats in front of me, there was not the usual entertainment screen cabinet to make stepping over the aisle passenger next to me tricky as with other rows.  Row 1 also gives a good vantage point to watch on and quick access to the washroom at the right front of the cabin which many business class passengers overlook in favour of the two washrooms between the two sections of the business class cabin.  \n\nAs I had flown the route recently, I opted for the Western meal instead of the Japanese meal I had before for my lunch.  The beef tenderloin in red wine sauce was good but it does not compare to the excellent Japanese meals on JAL.  \n\nRow 1 seats do not have the larger screens in a cabinet in front of the seat and has instead smaller screens you have to pull out of the center armrest.  Entertainment system was never a strength of JAL anyway so I did not mind the smaller screen tradeoff for the huge picturesque window. \n\nNotwithstanding the angle flat configuration, I did get a few hours of decent sleep before cabin attendants woke the passengers about 2 1/2 hours before arrival for breakfast.  \n\nAnother little hiccup I had related to my checked luggage. I was connecting to a Cathay Pacific flight the next morning at 9 am and asked if JAL could check through my luggage since they are both One World Alliance partners and as the CX flight can also be purchased on JAL as they are code share partners on the flight.  I was told by Vancouver check in staff they could not check through and I had to pick up my luggage and check in with Cathay at Tokyo Narita.  However when I failed to see my luggage delivered in Narita and checked with ground staff there, they pointed out my luggage receipt actually said Hong Kong so apparently my luggage was checked through anyway.  I checked with JAL upstairs in departures again to be sure and they explained that they can check through for flights departing within 24 hours of my arrival on JAL. \n\nA couple small hiccups on this particular JAL flight but will stick with the airline for the route as it is competitively priced to Hong Kong compared to Air Canada and Cathay Pacific, and service and food are excellent.",

        "review_text": "I took the short haul flight from Haneda (Tokyo) to Itami (Osaka) on JL121 in J-Class, which is the domestic business class.  I arrived at the airport about 90 minutes before my flight, used my One World elite status to use the very efficient First Class check-in and then the dedicated security entrance and lane for First Class passengers and top level frequent flyers located just to the left of the check-in counter.  The whole process was extremely efficient, friendly and a surprisingly nice touch for a short haul domestic flight.  \n\nThe dedicated security lane was very quick with no line ups so within minutes, I was into the JAL Diamond Premier lounge.  The lounge was huge and the decor was stunning for a domestic level lounge.  Pass the reception desk, there is a luggage storage area with keyed lockers to store your carry-on (including handy roll in ones at the bottom for your roll on board).  Past the storage area and then washrooms is the entrance to the main lounge.  To the right, there was a dining area with some basic foods on offer (corn soup, miso soup, some breads including a curry bun referencing the famous curry that is served in JAL international lounges, and two kinds of rice cakes), then to the immediate left an open seating area with seats that are well designed with a privacy screen between seats and a built in storage area next to the seat for your carry-on, and finally to the far left a larger seating area with individual cubicles that are very private (the cubicle walls are high enough that from the entrance you cannot see the occupants of the cubicles at all) equipped with a comfortable arm chair and a little pedestal table.  The level of comfort and size of the domestic lounge at Haneda puts the JAL Narita First Class lounge to shame so hopefully the renovation that has begun on the second level of the First Class Lounge for JAL at Narita Terminal 2 main building will result in a revampt of that the seating areas in that lounge to at least match the domestic lounge.\n\nI had to try the curry bun since it is featured in the JAL website description, and it was very good, not very spicy at all.  My lounge stay was thoroughly enjoyable. \n\nThe flight to Itami boarded on time 15 minutes prior to the flight.  For this domestic flight, JAL has a small First Class cabin with lie flat seats and serves a hot meal even during the short flight.  For business class, or J-Class in domestic speak, the configuration was 2-4-2 on the B777-200.  I had seat 10C the bulkhead row right at the door where the second airbridge connects.  During boarding, it was a bit inconvenient as passengers entered right in front of your seat but during flight, it was a good seat as the passenger next to you does not need to step over you to get to the aisle and there is unlimited legroom to stretch out.\n\nThe J-Class seats recline a bit and also have a leg rest that extends up a bit but only useful if you recline your seat as well as the leg rest does not actually touch your legs or support them when your seat back is not reclined (at least for an average height person).  No entertainment system on this short flight, other than music channels at your seat. \n\nActual flight time is less than an hour so there is not much time for anything other than a simple drink service.  The flight arrived on time and exit out out Itami airport was quick.  The gate was very near the baggage claim area, there was a short wait of a couple of minutes for luggage (there are windows in the baggage claim area and I could actually see the luggage containers being removed from our plane and then being driven over below the baggage claim area), and then I was quickly out to take the limousine bus with its cheap frequent service to Osaka city center.  Transit from Itami to Osaka is only 30 minutes, about half the time that it would take if you flew into Kansai airport instead.  \n\nA good domestic business class flight offering that is only slightly more expensive than economy, worth it for the less crowded J-Class cabin, a more convenient arrival airport at Itami rather than Kansai, and an impressive experience at an unexpectedly luxuriously fitted First Class lounge at Haneda airport domestic terminal.",

        "review_text": "Having suffered from Qantas' and Virgin's economy class, I chose JAL premium economy in Nov 2018. I think some of the things I got was for Business class. For the small additional fare compared with economy, it is value for money. But I am not sure how long this could last.\n\nHere were some good things. I got a ticket for speedy custom service. There was virtually no queue. It took about 10 minutes in total to go through custom including security check.\n\nThen I could use the Qantas lounge - comfortably seats with free breakfast and drinks. \n\nThe leg room on the plan was more than I expected. I estimated that the leg of a person of 5 foot tall could not reach the back of the seat in front.\n\nOn the return flight from Tokyo, JAL's Sakura lounge provided free dinner and drinks. There was another quiet and nice area for people to go on the web or rest.\n\nMost surprisingly, I got a pass to use the quick custom service when I returned to Sydney. While other people were queuing for the self custom service, I was already out. And ... my luggage was already on the conveyor belt. This is the first time that I did not need to wait for my luggage.",

Last time I used it was almost 18 years ago. I wasn't certain about Narita airport for the connecting flight. The sign at the airport was great both ways and I had plenty of time to go through security check before the connecting flight. Food in flight toward Pusan was not that great for my taste but on the way back was much better. The service was courteous and pleasant. I would definitely fly JAL if I travel to Pusan again. If Incheon is my destination, I would still prefer Korean Air or Air Canada.",

        "type_of_route": "International",
        "review_text": "I had a long layover at Narita before my flight to Vancouver so had lots of time to try out all aspects of JAL's Narita First Class lounge.  I arrive shortly after it opened at 7:30 am and found that it filled up very quickly.  I had breakfast and lunch in the lounge and there was a great selection of hot and cold food in the buffet.  The made to order sushi counter was also opened at breakfast (it operates 7:30 am to 12:30 pm and then again from 3 pm to 8 pm.\n\nThere was a special treat in the lounge on the day I was there - JAL was introducing some kind of local sweet made with red bean paste and chestnut - and in the afternoon, there were a number of reporters crowded around the featured sweet taking pictures.  \n\nAfter breakfast, I used the shower rooms to take a shower.  The shower room is not very large but does have everything you need and a rainfall showerhead and multi side jets in the shower.\n\nJAL is renovating the second floor part of the First Class lounge at Narita's Terminal 2 main building so the lounge was more crowded than usual.  Around 10 am after taking my shower, I had trouble finding an empty seat in the lounge.  Luckily the crowd seemed to disappear quickly too so after an hour or two, suddenly the lounge was quiet and fairly empty again.  I came off an overnight flight and wanted to nap a bit in the lounge but found there were very few seats that you could comfortably nap in (most have low backs). \n\nJAL used to have massage therapists giving short back massages but stopped that a couple of years ago choosing instead to rely on installing more massage chairs.  I used the massage chair once again on one of the 15 minute programs and it was fairly good but still feels like small bowling balls rolling up and down your back, a far cry from the real person massage therapists the First Class lounge used to have.\n\nI went to the boarding gate a bit before the scheduled boarding time as JAL typically does board promptly.  JAL has special priority lines for its highest frequent flyer levels and offers the same privilege to One World Alliance Emerald members so I boarded very early and got settled in quickly.  JAL uses a beautiful B787 Dreamliner for the Tokyo to Vancouver flight but as many have complained, continues to use an outdated angled Shell Flat Neo seat.  It is quite comfortable and actually works quite well but still cannot compete with any of the other airline's or JAL's own fully flat bed seats.  \n\nService and food as usual were excellent on my flight.  Window seats do not have direct aisle access and window seat passengers have to step over the aisle passenger, which can be a bit tricky balance-wise when the aisle seat passenger has fully reclined into an angle bed mode.  However, in row 1, there is no cabinet with the entertainment system in front of the seat (the screen is pull out from the center armrest) so the window passenger can step over the aisle passenger much more easily even if the seat is in angle flat bed mode.  With the much larger windows that the B787 offers, this is one plane that makes it worthwhile to select the window seat even if it means less convenient indirect aisle access.  \n\nFlight was on time departing and arriving.  JAL is behind the times with its angle flat seats on this route but makes up for it with superior food and service.",

Then, when I explained the situation to her and even mentioned that JAL had a copy of my doctors note on file, she left, then came back and said she had one aisle seat available and would move me after take off.. Which she did, to an aisle seat, with leg room, and next to an empty seat! I was in passenger heaven! JAl is the best in my book. An airline with heart!",

        "review_text": "I took the overnight flight on Japan Airlines from Bangkok to Tokyo Narita.  When I checked in, I was requested to use a third party lounge rather than JAL's own Sakura lounge until after 9:30 pm as they said the lounge would be too busy with other earlier overnight JAL flights.  However, when I got to the lounge, they said it was not overly busy so they admitted me anyway eventhough it was earlier than 9:30 pm.  The lounge was pretty packed but there were still seats and table available near the dining area.  I wanted to eat dinner in the lounge and go to bed after the flight takes off as it was an 11:25 pm departure and the flight time was less than 6 hours so there would not be enough time to sleep.  Food offering in the lounge was quite good with lots of variety - both chicken and beef curry, hamburger steak in tomato sauce, clams cooked in kimchi, sausage, fried chicken - a bit of a strange mishmash but definitely substantial enough for dinner.  I noticed also that after I finished my meal, a few of the food options had been changed.  After 9:30 pm, the lounge became a lot quieter as a couple of earlier flights were boarding.  Seating is not fancy but it is a good sized lounge with good food offerings for a business class lounge.\n\nThe flight was boarded on time as is usual for JAL.  The flight was operated using a B787 fitted with Sky Suites in Business Class - this is an excellent product, fully lie flat, great privacy and lots of trays and storage areas to put drinks, glasses, tablets or phones.  There is a really clever little storage tray just above and behind your seat with a mesh cover that is handy for charging cords, phones, and any other small items to be kept safe from falling into the seat sides.  I noticed that each of the seats has slightly different configuration of trays and storage spaces.  I had the window seat which is the only one with the storage tray above and behind my seat and by comparison, it looks like the window seat has the most usable and useful storage areas. \n\nI was feeling a bit hungry when I boarded the flight and therefore opted to try the late night sushi snack.  On boarding, cabin crew also asked you to fill out a form indicating if you want to be woken for breakfast and if so, your food choice.  I filled in that I would like the Japanese breakfast set as typically the Japanese food on JAL is better than its Western options. I did note that while the food is very good, it was noticeably inferior to th earlier flight I took on JAL from Osaka Kansai to Bangkok, probably because the Japan based food caterer is better than the Bangkok based one. \n\nI had a very good sleep during the flight as the Sky Suite is very comfortable for sleep.  The flight was scheduled to land 7:15 am and arrived a little early.  By the time I walked from the gate at the satellite terminal to the main terminal, the First Class lounge was just opening at 7:30 am so the timing was good. \n\nI enjoyed this overnight flight very much.  Service is excellent and the seat is very comfortabel for sleeping in an overnight flight.  There was also lots of privacy and with direct aisle access from every seat, I was not disturbed in my rest.",

The aircraft was a Boeing 777-200 and seating was 3-4-3.  I found my window seat to be comfortable enough for a 1h20m flight and the plane was very well maintained.  Take off was on time and soon we were flying high over Honshu.  While there is insufficient time for meal service in economy class, a complimentary drink was offered - and appreciated.\nArrival was slightly delayed due to weather, but Japan airlines acquitted itself handsomely with the quick delivery of our baggage.\nAll in all, the good, efficient, and courteous economy class service of Japan Airlines is fine, especially for rather short, domestic flights in Japan.",

Nothing was too much trouble and all delivered with genuine and sincere smiles.\n\nThe seating outbound was the Shell Flat Neo which was perfectly adequate and the return leg was the impressive Sky Suite boasting a 23\" LCD monitor.  We should add that the Sky Suite is the best Business Class product we've ever had the fortune to be seated in.\n\nWe very much look forward to flying with JAL again in the future.",

As soon as we sat, both seats reclined back too far into an uncomfortable position.  The flight attendants recognized this was a problem and called for 2 technicians to fix our seats.  They quickly arrived and without even examining the seat, simply said in broken English \"normal, very normal\" and walked off the aircraft.  There were lots of smiles and apologies from the flight crew, but no action.  I have flown around the world a couple of times and I know what a business class seat or any aircraft seat should feel like in an upright position.  It should not feel like I am lying down.  The flight was just over a couple of hours and my old back took a beating, but I must say the flight crew were gracious and attentive.",

        "review_text": "Every year for my 'Satogaeri' trip to Japan, we have travelled to and from Narita, but this year we have decided to travel back to the UK via Haneda using JAL just on the inbound flight ( our outbound flight was by Finnair). Before this I flew with JAL before but operated by Finnair or BA ( I think), and didn't get a good trip. This time I flew back from Haneda to London Heathrow with JAL operated airline. My honest opinion was that on the whole I did enjoy the trip back to the UK this time and the services ( ranging from airline food, in-flight entertainment system and so on) were good. \n(1) Legrooms: the most important of all for me was the legroom on the Economy seat, as everything depended on it for the duration of 12 hour flight, which would be bound to cause extra strain on myself as I age on all annual trips ! To my relief, JAL operated fleet does provide a good and wide enough legroom for Economy class seats, so I was very pleased with it. Even with the reclined seat by the person in front of me ( this time again ) I still had enough leg room to stretch my legs, which was good, but the only snag was the reclined seat got me a shorter distance between the flight entertainment screen and my eyes and I had to keep my head away from the screen to give me the right distance for correct angles and viewing ( the tilting of the screen didn't help me in this case);\n(2) flight meals: I think JAL were quite generous in providing more than sufficient amount of meals to passengers on this flight ( JL43). I think I have an average appetite just like other people, but the long haul flight can influence my appetite quite easily too. On this flight, I did enjoy the meal that was served first after the takeoff from Haneda. The choice of meal was adequate, it was either beef or chicken dish with rice and I chose the latter and enjoyed it.But it was quite a heavy meal with good amount of rice and chocolate mousse as a desert. We were also provided with a small pot of Hagen Daz ice cream after that. The  meal was served really quickly and all the food with trays were removed swiftly afterwards. Then about half way through the flight journey we were woken up again by serving of another light meal,which proved to be quite heavy for my stomach. It was a oval shaped bun with tuna mayo filling. I love tuna mayo, but my stomach was still digesting the previous meal when this was served 6 hours later. But being a glutton for food I couldn't refuse, so I consumed it, which turned out to be a bad mistake. Then about 2 hours before the landing we were served for the final time another supper. My stomach was still full with previous two course meals in it, but I couldn't say no to this meal either, as JAL was serving \u5409\u91ce\u5bb6\u306e\u725b\u4e3c, which I never had before as a flight meal. I don't know what non- Japanese passengers thought of this last meal, but I was quite intrigued by this meal as this company, Yoshinoya was ubiquitously known in Japan like MacDonalds in early 80's ( I think) selling their best selling product, Beef bowl with rice ( Gyudon) and I never had a chance to eat any of their product until this flight. Timing was unfortuante though as my palate was somewhat paralysed with full stomach, which struggled to operate and I could just taste the beef and egg sauce. All I remember in this flight was feeling queasy and full stomach;\n(3) Air circulation and temperature within the aircraft:\nThe only thing I would seriously complain in this trip was about this matter. I noticed quite a number of passengers were sneezing several times and I found the temperature in the aircraft really hot. In fact, for the whole journey I was feeling really hot and regretted I should have come in with short sleeved shirt.  I wonder if I was one of the few passengers who experienced hot air during the whole journey;\n(4) in-flight entertainmment system:\nThe selection of entertainment was adequate for me. I would normally read a book or listen to my own personal audio player anyway, so I didn't miss much even if there weren't enough choice in the flight system. But I think the improvement was made for the touch screen system. I wasn't keen on this screen when it was first introduced because if you had a passenger behind you who would use the touch screen in ' Rocky' manner, he/she would simply punch the screen to select/ deselect each time and I would be the victim of being punched at the back for the whole 12 hour journey. That would be my nightmare. It did happen to me once with codeshare flight. However on this journey, I only felt some light tap a few times from behind and hardly noticed it most of the time. Or maybe I was lucky to be seated with a very considerate passenger behind me. \nOverall this trip from Haneda to London Heathrow was good and pleasant despite the lack of sleep ( as I always experience on every long haul flight). The only other comment I would make is about the seating plan. In this flight, the fleet had a seating plan of 3 ( left) - 3( centre) -3 ( right) seats in most rows in Economy class. At the check-in counter we both wanted aisle seats and we were told that we would get aisle seats as there were two seats, but when we got into the aircraft we realised we were allocated one aisle and the seat next to it ( middle seat). We didn't minds getting two aisle seats with front and back, and I think the JAL staff who served us possibly misunderstood us. \nBut we relatively had a good and almost problem free flight on this trip, so we would certainly consider JAL to be one of the possible candidate flight carrier for our journey next year.  We have used Finnair for the past few years  and their service has been equally good too, but with the Brexit situation in the UK yet to be settled we  would have to find out what each airline could offer next year.",

When I returned to the airport, I found my way to the fast track security and I was airside in about 10 minutes. \n\nBeing a J class passenger, you\u2019re afforded access to the wonderful Sakura Lounge. For those in the know, however, you also have access to the Admirals Club, Cathay Pacific Lounge and the Qantas Business Lounge. If you\u2019ve the time, I highly recommend lounge-hopping. The Qantas Lounge is SUPER quiet (since their flights are red-eyes). \n\nWhen I checked in in Malaysia, the agent asked if I wanted an aisle seat instead of middle. I declined because I read the middle seat is actually very private. When I checked in at Narita, the agent also asked if I wanted an aisle instead of middle. Trust me, for this flight, you\u2019ll want a middle seat. \n\nBoarding promptly began at 16:40 in such an orderly fashion. Boarding begins with passengers with children and those that need extra time. Then, first class and upper tier Mileage Bank members can board, followed by business class. \n\nOn their 777, there is a forward, intimate biz class cabin - there are only seven seats in this area. I highly recommend you secure a seat in this forward area. \n\nFlight attendants came round with welcome drinks and I helped myself to some champagne. \n\nWhile it doesn\u2019t seem like the middle seat provides much privacy, once the dividers go up, you\u2019re in your own little world. What\u2019s also great is you still have aisle access. \n\nAfter takeoff, cabin crew came round to take meal orders. I opted for the Japanese menu and a lovely sauvignon blanc. I love JAL cabin crew because they\u2019re not only friendly, but they\u2019re incredibly gracious. \n\nI highly recommend the Japanese meal. It\u2019s beautifully presented, tasty and the ingredients are top-notch (I really enjoyed the root vegetables simmered in broth). \n\nAfter the meal service, you\u2019re able to order snacks from your seat (why don\u2019t more airlines offer this technology...?). I ordered a katsu sandwich, udon soup and ice cream. My flight attendant brought it out about ten minutes after I ordered it. \n\nMy only one complaint is I found the entertainment to be lacking. While there are new movies on board, I didn\u2019t have much interest in them. Though, I enjoyed the Japanese movies. \n\nSadly, our 8 hour flight came to a close. We landed and taxied to our gate. \n\nI paid $1500 for this one-way flight. Highly recommend JAL.",

        "review_text": "I tried an overnight flight on JAL from Osaka Kansai to Bangkok departing past midnight at 12:55 am and arriving at 4:40 am.  I was a bit worried about the overnight flight as the flight time was not very long and I was worried about getting enough sleep to be functional on arrival.  My worries were misplaced as I actually slept very well on the flight.  \n\nWe departed on time, taxied for a while and took off around 1:10 am, and arrived about 10 minutes early at about 4:30 am.  JAL uses a B787 Dreamliner with angle flat Shell Flat Neo seats.  While the angle flat seats are of course less comfortable than fully flat bed seats and as the Shell Flat Neo do not give direct aisle access for all seats, I found my seat 1H in the first row on the aisle to work quite well for this flight.  The flight was completely full in business class and the passenger beside me in 1K appeared to be quite ill with a cold or flu so he was sleeping even before the flight took off and rarely moved from his seat during the flight.  \n\nOn boarding, cabin staff distributed breakfast preference cards so passengers can select whether to be woken for breakfast and what they wanted for breakfast.  I selected being woken for breakfast and the full Japanese breakfast set.  Soon after take off, I reclined my seat to its full angle flat position and slept soundly for about 4 hours out of a slightly less than 6 hour flight time.  Because of the time of the flight, eventhough business class was completely full and there were children in the section, it was very quiet throughout the flight.\n\nAbout an hour and a half before landing, I was gently woken with a pat on the shoulder for my breakfast.  I regret not having collected my senses to take photos because the Japanese breakfast set tray was simply stunningly beautiful in presentation. Even small pieces of vegetable were carved into the shape of a maple leave and colored to give a more beautiful presentation to the meal.  Not only beautiful, the breakfast was also delicious.  Especially memorable was one of the many starters offered in the bento box which consisted of a slightly more solid tofu with a wasabi sauce topped by a couple of shrimps - the wasabi added just the right interest to the tofu.\n\nPrior to arrival, cabin attendants distributed priority lane passes to all business class passengers allowing them to use the very fast no line-up priority lanes for immigration at Suvarnabhumi airport.  My suitcase was delivered within a few minutes of my arrivingn at the baggage carousel and I was out to meet my ride within about 20 minutes of the doors opening after landing.",

        "review_text": "I took a domestic connecting flight from Narita to Osaka Itami airport on JAL and was pleasantly surprised that JAL chose to use a B767 with Sky Suite flat bed seats for the short 1 hour or so domestic flight.  The Sky Suite is very luxurious and comfortable since it can convert into a flat bed and as it is very private with the seated passenger well shielded from the aisle.  The configuration is 1X2X1 with the window seats alternating with the flat console on the window side or on the aisle side.  I was in 2A, which is the better window seat as the console for my seat was between me and the aisle giving me additional privacy.  There is a storage cabinet next to me on top of the console and a storage slot under the video screen for your smartphone or tablet.  Sky Suite would be a very comfortable seat for a long haul sleeping flight and so for a short haul, it was clearly beyond expectations. \n\nDue to the short flight time, there was just a simple drinks service which was carried out with JAL's usual grace and politeness. Also due to the short flight time, there was no video entertainment program eventhough all seats had video screens.   \n\nWe departed on time and arrived on time.  An excellent beyond expectation short haul domestic flight.",

        "departure": "Vancouver",
        "destination": "Tokyo",
        "type_of_route": "International",
        "review_text": "I took the JAL afternoon flight from Vancouver to Narita on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, configured 2X2X2 in business class with the two window seats without direct aisle access.  As the plane was fairly full in business class, I opted for seat 1C since it would be easier for the window seat passenger to step over me because there is no seat in front.  When I reserved my seat 1A was unoccupied but unfortunately it was occupied by flight time.  Nevertheless, with no seat in front, I was not disturbed when the window seat passenger had to step over me to access the aisle.  \n\nThe usual complaint applies that JAL chose to use a beautiful new plane in the Dreamliner for the route but install outdated angle flat seats in business class.  I slept a little bit on the flight but not deep sleep but I think it was more a matter of the flight time during the afternoon and evening rather than the angle flat seat.  1C does get a bit more traffic passing by it as there is a washroom in front of it past the galley but it was not excessive as there are two other washrooms behind the first set of business class seats.  The relative ease of step over for row 1 seats is counter-balanced by the negative that your video entertainment screen has to be lifted out of the divider between the two seats and therefore you cannot continue watching entertainment during landing as you are required to stow your video screen. \n\nAs usual, service is superb and food is both beautifully presented and delicious.  There are both Japanese and Western meal offerings and while the Western offerings always sound tempting as well, I almost always opt for the Japanese meal since they seem to be so much more substantial with many more items.  Coffee on JAL in business class is a special blend only offered on flight in business class and it is one of the best coffees I have had in the air so I always enjoy a couple on a flight. \n\nJAL is very good with time management and boarding management so we departed on time and arrived a little early.  I did have an issue on this flight in that when my priority tagged luggage showed up as the first suitcase delivered to the luggage carousel, it was damaged.  Aside from some indentations in the soft sided suitcase, the entire pull out handle was missing and there just two wires sticking out of the tubes from which the pull out handle would have been extended.  I reported the damage to JAL and they sent me to JAL Lost & Found located outside immigration and customs and next to the domestic check-in desk.  I told Lost & Found my suitcase was severely damaged and hard to use without the pull out handle and I had a connecting domestic flight to catch in about 90 minutes time.  They offered me a replacement suitcase but they only have one type in two colors and it was a very solid but very heavy hard sided suitcase weighing more than 13 lbs whereas my usual suitcases are light soft sided suitcase weighing less than 10 lbs.  I had no choice but to accept the replacement suitcase as my damaged suitcase was not really usable for continuing my trip on the domestic connecting flight so I took everything out of my damaged suitcase and put it in the replacement suitcase.  Luckily the replacement suitcase is a full 28 inch large suitcase so there was plenty of room for all my luggage contents.  I should mention Lost & Found was extremely polite in handling the problem and thorough in helping double check my damaged suitcase once I transferred all my belongings to make sure nothing was left behind.  Lost & Found also advised that they would arranged for the destruction of the damaged suitcase once I left.  \n\nLost & Found then required me to sign a form acknowledging I received a replacement suitcase and told me I would not be able to claim compensation for damage since I received a replacement suitcase.  I told them I would take up the issue with JAL after I get to my destination as I felt it was unfair that I was forced to accept a heavy replacement suitcase that I would not normally buy and be unable to claim for part of the cost of a replacement suitcase similar to the one that was damaged and that would be what I would normally use.  \n\nWhen I arrived at my destination, I did contact JAL through their website and initially their response was the same as Lost & Found in denying any compensation because I received a replacement suitcase.  After some back and forth explanation, I am glad to report JAL did accept I did not have a choice but to accept their replacement suitcase and that the replacement is not what I would buy for myself or use normally.  They agreed to compensate me for part of the cost of my damaged suitcase, which I accepted as a very fair handling of the situation.  \n\nIn summary, while I did have an unexpected unpleasant experience of finding my luggage has been severely damaged in transit, ultimately JAL handle the matter well, gave me a replacement suitcase to allow me to continue my travels and made a fair agreement to partly compensate for the damaged suitcase as the replacement was not what I would buy for myself.",

I recommend that if you can afford it you upgrade to at least premium economy if you want to sleep. I was travelling with my five year old son overnight for the flight out so getting some sleep was important. He slept for about six hours but was very uncomfortable as the seats to not recline much and there was nowhere for him to rest his feet (other than on me!) I did not sleep at all. In premium the seats recline more and a footrest comes up. In business you get fully flat beds. \n\nOn the positive side, however, the service on the flight both ways was excellent. Staff couldn\u2019t do enough for us. Snacks and drinks were left out for us between meals and my son was thoroughly spoiled with toys and a special child\u2019s meal (which was bigger, tastier and more fun that the adults\u2019 one!) I can\u2019t fault my food though, and it was nice to get Japanese food. There was a decent range of films and TV to keep us both entertained, although there could have been a few more children\u2019s films available. \n\nOn the whole I would recommend flying with JAL. A pretty painless experience for what could have been a hellishly long and horrid flight.",

The seats were lay down but hard as concrete and not enough room to lay sideways comfortably.  The entertainment was also difficult and combursome to navigate.  The food was marginally better than cafeteria in business class.  The 767 plane coming from Narita to Taoyuan was the worst seats I have ever been on.  It reminded me of my grandfathers broken recliner.  Horrible design and broken seating adjustments.  JAL will get you were you want to go but I hope the review their competition!  The pillows are so small it\u2019s comical, the blanket is thin as a sheet.  The details matter in business class.  Other Airlines are offer MORE for the same price.",

The flight attendants are exactly that -- attentive. And they'll speak to you in any language you prefer -- they'll even open the conversation with a Caucasian in Japanese, if that's what he suggests! No problems with luggage either -- it arrived very timely.",

        "review_text": "I ended up on the flight as part of a trip to Hong Kong, Korea and Japan. This was the last long haul leg and I usually use this leg to adjust back my body clock so good sleep is essential. To be fair I make multiple long haul flights a year in either business or first class and with over 25 years of doing this I have seen all the seats and all the levels of service across many airlines so maybe I am just getting picky. But - this is an old configuration that few still use and on pretty much my favorite aircraft (Dreamliner) this was very surprising. These days business is pretty much 4 across in a \u2018pod\u2019 style arrangement with large screen, full lay flat and usually a mattress pad etc. However this flight was 6 across - so you are sitting right next to your fellow flyer, no privacy screen and seats that should have been banned years ago. These are the seats that recline to about 30 degrees, have the hump in the middle and the flip out footrest to catch the continual slide that the angle causes. They are by far the most uncomfortable seats ever put in business class and the inventor should be made to sit in one for 10 painful hours every day and then apologize to all flyers who ever used one. Multiple complaints and grumbling from passengers and it amazes me the Japan Air considers this acceptable. So I did not sleep, ended up with back ache and once off the bed of torture swore I will never fly this route with this airline again. These seats were so old fashioned they even had the screen that comes out of the arm rest and sits at a crooked angle.  Food was mediocre, service excellent. Stay well away - this is just cheap old fashioned seating and cram as many passengers in travel that most abandoned 10 years ago.",

        "review_text": "While it was all so very polite, lots of bowing etc. the actual service delivery was just average. For a start, very few of the cabin attendants spoke reasonable English which made communication difficult. The magazine had so many languages that I couldn't easily ascertain how some of the equipment worked. Also the airline seemed to treat their own nationals better than Westerners. It was impossible for us to pre-select our seats and only sterling efforts by our travel agent had us seated reasonably together. another couple was not as fortunate being separated by 4 seats and an aisle.\nWhen one travels in a Premium class it is not much different to walking into a restaurant. I am used to being offered a drink after I board the plane as happens on all of my other international flights.  On this flight there was no service for an hour. While this might have been acceptable to a passenger starting their trip at Narita, we had come from Berlin and had been travelling for about 15 hours already. \nThat said, the actual plane, a Dreamliner, was fine and the seat comfortable. Because flights from Australia to almost anywhere the level of service is so important. To me, and my wife, JAL failed the test. My wife now even wants to fly Qantas, although she has been critical of that airline in the past",

I was excited to see it included lounge access which meant a chance to freshen up in Tokyo\nHowever -even though we booked the whole journey through Japan airlines it was only afterwards we learnt the Tokyo-London leg was codeshare and a British airways flights. \nThis meant no ability to select seats or preselect meals (which can be done on british airways). It also  meant no access to the lounge at Narita -even though we thought we had booked a JAL premium economy ticket because of the codeshare we were not eligible (fun to find out when exhausted after 10 hours flight)\nThe flight itself I'd have given 4 stars to -great seevice by staff, food was okay, plenty of room in the seat. Would have liked a bit more recline and extension of footrest but that was fine. Got some sleep (would have got more but as with all flights there was a crying toddler)\n\nAt least our return flights are all JAL so lounge access is fine.",

Whilst the rest of the JAL experience was excellent the seat is awful. The seat is as hard as nails, I was constantly having to re-adjust my position because I was sliding on the seat's fabric when the seat was in the recline position and with no in-built foot rest it was nigh on impossible to maintain a position consistent with sleep. My bum was numb after 6 hours of a near ten hour flight. I won't be flying with JAL again which is a shame because the lounge, the food, the cabin crew were all excellent.",

Most of crews are super excellent but her service was outstanding with fluent english. I must point out floor carpet and divider units of 011 are bit outdated and quality of main meal.

The staff, from ground agents to flight crew, was exceptionally courteous and polite. Waiting at the gate, the flight crew passed by, stopped, turned around and bowed to the passengers before boarding the plane. Boarding started 30 minutes prior to departure and was so efficient that the plane was backing out of the gate with about 8 minutes to spare. There was ample overhead bin storage available. Even though my family flew economy class, there was more legroom than we are used to on American carriers. The seats were comfortable. As the plane left the gate, the JAL ground crew on the tarmac lined up, waved, and then bowed to the plane and its passengers.The food and beverage service was very good, much better than we are used to. Passengers are even given slippers. The cabin was clean and there were multiple entertainment options available. The inflight service was excellent. Deboarding the plane was also very orderly and efficient. I don't know why boarding/deboarding takes so long on American carriers. The flight departed on time (actually ahead of time) and arrived on time (actually ahead of time). The service on JAL is over the top. My family and I are flying on JAL again in a couple of months. It is definitely worth it!",

The business class lounge at Tullamarine airport was a shared arrangement and quite ordinary. The plane cabin layout was cheap looking and the seats narrow. Sleeping on the overnight Melb/Tokyo sector was very difficult. Our vegetarian meals were all cold and largely tasteless. The only saving grace was the very friendly and efficient cabin staff. On top of that (not necessarily the airlines fault) one of our cases was damaged. However dealing with JAL ground staff re: repairs is inefficient.",

At least boarding is separate, but airlines need to raise this issue with AOT. The desk was built to allow two lanes, why not use it that way?\n\nDrink service on the outbound commenced 1 hour after take off, and meal service about 1 hour and 20 minutes. Food quality and general service is as different as night from day outbound versus inbound. Flight information page on VOD was not available. Seat was uncomfortable, with limited functionality, and not the best if you suffer from claustrophobia, or unless you enjoy sleeping in a coffin.",

He has also recently had a by-pass and open heart surgery. I am an 85 year old pensioner, and my friend's carer, This trip was planned especially to be a relaxing holiday for both of us where we planned to stay with my sister in the United Kingdom and then spend four days in Tokyo on the way back to Sydney, Australia.\nWe booked our flight through iTalktravel & Cruise | Blue Mountains, Australia who sold us The package: Japan Airlines (JAP).  JL 772, JL 7081(British Airways), JL 42 & JL 771. We accepted this even though on our first stage we would arrive in Tokyo at Narita 17.05 hours on 30 August 2018 and depart the following day from Tokyo Narita at 12.55 hours (a stop over of  19 hours). Our Travel agent was quite clear the the package included JAL arranging the transfers to and from overnight accommodation paid for by JAL. The booking also required wheel chair services for my friend on every section of this round trip journey.\n\nBoth my friend and I were looking forward to a most relaxing and enjoyable trip to help us recover from all the worry and anxiety we had gone through as a result of my friend having open heart surgery and a by-pass operation in April this year.\n \nAt Sydney International Airport we needed to advise the JAL personal that my friend needed to be wheeled from the check-in to the Qantas Lounge then to the aircraft. This was then arranged.\n \nA short while after take-off we were given the customs forms to complete. These required us to indicate the address at which we would be staying while in Tokyo. As we did not know which hotel JAL had booked us into we told the Flight Attendants that we expected them to advise us where we were to be accommodated during the stopover. This would have been about one hour after take-off. The Flight Attendants stated that JAL never arranged for overnight accommodation for their passengers and that this should have been done by our travel agent. We showed the Flight Attendent our booking itinerary, which clearly stated \"... Once flights have been ticketed JAL will provide confirmation for your stopover...\"  \n\nThe Flight Attendants insisted that JAL'never ever' paid for passengers overnight accommodation. \nWe explained to the Flight Attendants that because there was such a long delay between flight JL 772 on 30th August 2018 and flight JL 7081(the BA flight) on 31 August 2018 ( a stop over of 19 hours) JALhad made this package to sell the tickets. \n\nThis constant insistance by the Flight Attendants that it was not JAL's responsibility to provide our overnight accommodation caused us extreme distress. As we did not know what we could do when we arrived at Narita Airport we asked if it would be possible for us to use the JAL Sakura Lounge and stay there overnight. \n'NO this was not possible', we were told. At no time did any of the Flight Attendants offer to communicate with JAL or our Travel Agent to confirm what we had believed to be, and what were in fact the arrangements. \n\nFortunately, we noticed that Wi-Fi was available on the flight. We tried to send an email to our Travel Agent but it failed to go. This would have been now some six hours since we boarded the flight. We asked the Flight Attendant why the email could not be sent and were told that we would need to pay for the service. Having then paid US$12.50 we sent the email to our Travel Agent. \n\nWithin thirty minutes of our email to our travel agent, a JAL Flight Attendant came and apologised and showed us the message they had received. The message read:\n\tTO JL772 RE ST18A/18C PAX CASE 2\n\tTHE PAX ALREADY HAS A HOTEL \t\t\t\t\t\t\tRESERVATION,\n\tHARROAD INTERNATIONAL HOTEL NARITA.\n\tTWIN BWED ROOM.\n\tPAX DO NOT NEED TO PAY ADDITIONAL FEES.\n\tTHKS\n\tFROM NRTOO\nThis confirmed everything we had been saying ever since take-off. \n\nWhy did JAL Flight Attendants not contact JAL to confirm what we had said right at the beginning of our journey? It would have saved us having all the worry and anxiety for the entire journey. So now just before arriving at Tokyo we were able to try to calm down. \n\nHOWEVER THIS WAS NOT GOING TO BE THE END OF OUR TROUBLES.\n\nOn the morning of the 31th August 2018 we arrived at Narita Airport at about 09.00 hours. We went to the JAL check-in and inquired about the wheel chair for my friend. The JAL officer said that this was the responsibility of British Airways (BA) and advised us to go to the BA check in counter. We stated that as we had booked our flight with JAL it was JAL's responsibility. The JALofficer telephoned BA and then told us that BA would provide the wheel chair service for my friend. When we enquired if BA would take us to their lounge we were informed that as we were travelling Premium Economy with JAL we could not use BA Lounge. We asked if we could use JAP's Sakura Lounge and were told that we could not as our flight was with BA. We insisted that as our entire trip was with Japan Airlines this seemed absolute nonsense, for,  if JAL had used one of their own aircraft, we would be entitled to use the JALSakura Lounge. \n\nAgain the JALofficer insisted that this was not possible. We stated we were prepared to pay for the use of the JALSakura Lounge or the BA Lounge if necessary. Again we were informed that this was not an option. Finally after over one hour of  discussion and our trying to reason with JAL personnel, the JAL officer contacted her manager. \nThank goodness that this lady (JAL manager) used common sense to immediately organise a wheel chair for my friend, and we were escorted to the JALSakura Lounge at Narita Airport. \nOnce again we had to suffer unnecessary anxiety and stress for a good hour before the matter was resolved to our satisfaction.\nOur entire Premium Economy round trip from Sydney Australia, via Tokyo, Japan to Heathrow, United Kingdom with return with stop over at Tokyo, Japan, then return to Sydney, Australia was booked with Japan Airlines. Why did it take so long for Japan Airlines personnel to provide us with the service we had paid for and expected to receive as Premuim Economy passengers? \nThese flights with Japan Airlines that we had anticipated being a most enjoyable start to our four weeks holiday became a  horrendous and dissapointing experience. The food provided by JAL was absolutely disgraceful for the price we paid. It most certainly did not cater to the European palate. The only positive aspect regarding this flight was that the JAL Premium Economy seating was wide, comfortable and most satisfactory as the seats were able to recline without encroaching into the space behind. \nOur official conplaint to Japan Airlines with a request to upgrade us for our entire return trip was rejected. All we received were apologies and assurances that JAL staff were expected to know that JAL did infact pay for and provide overnight accommodation when there are delays between connecting flights.\nTwo very dissapointed customers,My friend and I had a most unnecessarily distressing and anxious journey during the first and second stages of our round trip booking with Japan Airlines.\nMy friend is a sixty-two year old pensioner who suffers from anxiety and depression.

In my view the in-cabin service is only part of the whole experience and I dont think its too much to ask that if you decide to buy air ticket and fly from 'A' to 'B' it should not be too much hassle. Well, it was a tremendous hassle with JAL. And Im sure will be with anybody if you need anything but just 'vanilla' flight LAX-Tokyo or NY-Osaka. Im flying to Okinawa, hopping there to Kume and Ishigaki islands, as well. I have spent many hours for several days trying to book these flights. The web site would not allow that - multi-destination reservation would not work, giving some cryptic errors, the Japan Explorer ('discount program') reservation would not work, either, and when finally I was able to at least reserve trip between Tokyo and Naha it was more expensive than just regular flight. I finally was able to get it done through Japanese site guessing on what kanji characters might mean there. Finally I bought round trip ticket and discovered later on that my return flight is not the same as direct flight-it actually goes through the wrong airport and I have to transfer within very limited time frame from Haneda to Narita. And no assistance with transfer is provided, nor can I rebook the flight from Naha without paying exorbitant fee, though multiple flights directly to Narita are available on the same date. So now I will have a very stressful time and a chance to miss my flight from Narita to LAX unless paying another >$600 for rebooking. At the very least the web site could warn customers that particular flight requires transfer. Waiting on phone whopping >1hr for customer service does nothing to make the whole experience less unpleasant. And to top it off, when I filled the contact form on their we site, describing my poor experience, hitting 'submit' button brought beautiful 'Access denied, you are not allowed to email from this server' message. At this point I could only laugh. First time Im flying JAL and sure the last one. All I need is to buy ticket and get where I need to go. Making it a battle and adventure is not it. Why did not I choose Cathay Pacific or Singapore Airlines ? A little longer stay in Hong Kong on the way but judging from my experience no hassle. Seems I need to learn things hard way. If you are like me, sure try JAL. The only reason I rate it 2 stars, not one, is that in-flight service and accomodation is fine, though not exceptional.",

Once on board, the entertainment was sufficient for a halfway around the world flight, and the meals on board were surprisingly good.  Who ever thought that Tex-Mex beef served aboard a Japanese airline would be better that the Asian selection, consumed by an Asian?  Plus, Narita Airport is quickly becoming my favorite place to refresh during a layover after a long flight.\nFrom now on, I 'm going to try an book on JAL whenever I have the opportunity.",

        "review_text": "The staff on board the 787 from LAX to KIX were fabulous. One out of four ordered the Japanese menu but the western menu of beef was far better. The seats on this plane are so hard and so short (don\u2019t lay flat) that the ride was not a comfortable one. Immigration at KIX was not as bad as we had read. Line moved quickly. Currently, you can only go out of the airport via a train. That was a fairly miserable train ride after a 12 hour flight. We got off at the first exit to meet our driver but it is very confusing which exit to take, therefore taking more time when we were tired. If you have a driver meeting you, get very explicit directions as how to which exit at the train station. Drive to Kyoto was another hour and a half. In hindsight, maybe a night or two before Osaka before we headed to Kyoto would have been better.",

Not much comparable on the food, though i like the variety of Jap beers they offered. \nThe services and attitude of the crews make this airline great to travel. Prompted to requests and always served with great smile. Show us an excellent customer service, We felt your warm hospitality and definitely our first choice for our next travel plan.",

The person in front of me put the seat back and I literally had NO room!!!  It might have been the most cramped I have ever been on a flight!!!  Attendants were nice but being cramped so badly didn\u2019t help.  Also, I am a \u201cSapphire\u201d with American Airlines (Platinum Pro) and JAL did NOT even let me pick my seats out.  I was assigned these seats the day of the flight with NO input?????  I don\u2019t get this at all?????????  I usually fly business or first class and I would have upgraded to Business on this flight but was given NO opportunity to do this?????????........so on this flight from Narita to Bangkok there were EMPTY seats in Business\u2026\u2026 I would have upgraded for sure if I was given any chance to do\u2026but again, I was NOT!!!!  From now on I think I\u2019ll just fly Cathay Pacific from the USA to Asia.  I am flying back with them when my business is done in Thailand and they worked with me several months before my flight to give me the best seats available due to my Sapphire status with \u201cOne World Alliance\u201d\u2026..

I came very prejudiced to this flight due to the fact that JAL would NOT let me procure a seat prior to the day of the flight!!!  I called American and JAL the day before I flew and JAL said I had not paid enough money for my flight to be able to pick a seat.  I paid about $1600 for the flight and I am a Platinum Pro (Sapphire) with American and One World Partners (Alliance??).  I was not very happy and on top of that I flew with JAL in March on the same flights to Bangkok and I DID pick my seat out early.  JAL said if I was an Executive Platinum that I could pick my seat out\u2026\u2026.it worked out OK for me as they assigned me a seat the morning of my travel and gave me an aisle seat in the middle bulkhead.  The lady in the bulkhead on the right side of the plane wanted to stow her baggage under her seat so another guy with the seat behind the bulkhead, myself, and this nice lady from the Philippines changed seats and I was given the seat I desired a long time ago.  No one is in front of me and I can stretch out easily!!!!  Now, the attendants on this flight are SUPER!!!   They are a great reason to fly JAL!!!!!!  They are super helpful and always have a smile and go out of their way to make you feel like you are the only person on the flight!!!  Also, the meal we were just given blows other airlines food out of the proverbial water!!!!!!!  I received a 6-course meal and every course was great!!!!!!!  My initial headlines were going to be NEVER fly JAL, but I am changing the crux of my article, thanks to the great people I have mentioned above!!!!!!!  I will write later about this on-going flight!!  We are just leaving North America and still have quite a ways to go!!!!!!  I\u2019m back!!!  Just had a snack.  These flight attendants are busy as bees in a hive and as nice as you could be!!!!!  I\u2019m laughing now as I\u2019m typing as I have done a 180 on my original intent for this story!!!!!!  These are the nicest and best flight attendants I have ever had the privilege of working with and I have flown an awful lot!!!  They also put out a piece of bamboo with a towel over it for people to stand on and relieve different stresses in their body.  They also posted a graphic on what part of the feet corresponds to different parts of your body!!!!!  This has been a great flight and I\u2019m actually going to post some pictures of this flight and that is highly unusual for me!!  They also have a cool wine label for their white and reds.  It\u2019s using different vinifera from France!!!!!  It\u2019s called Double Zero.  I also took a picture of a snack box they put out for all of us with the sign \u201cplease help yourself\u201d.  We have been flying now about 9.5 hours and it\u2019s gone pretty quick!!!!!  Great, great flight!!!!!!",

        "review_text": "This review is for booking and pre-flight customer service with JAL.\nI regret not reading through more complaints about JAL before booking on their website.  My issue has happened to others with shared code flights. My husband and I booked our first leg with JAL for our honeymoon.  We went onto their website for the booking.  At no point during the booking process are we informed about not being able select seats on the flight until check-in.  But that ended up being the case.  We called up JAL and their response was that we probably missed the bit where we are informed about no seat selection possible.  We went back and went through the online booking process again and cannot find a statement that informs us about no seat selection until check-in for that flight.  We called back again, the agent on the phone this time said that is the type of flight we booked and they cannot do anything except to add a note about that we wish to be seated together and informed us we can pick seats upon check-in time.  (On the side, all the calls have 30 min+ wait time so far)\nWhen it comes to harsh seat selection policy, we feel that if this is a short flight, fine.  If JAL is a bare bones budget airline, then fine.  If this is not our honeymoon, then fine.  Except this will be a long haul, international flight with a supposed 5-star service airline for our honeymoon.  JAL is beyond disappointing for us in the booking process, not only are we not informed about critical information that could help us decide, we cannot seem to get any help in correcting a situation that we did not create.\n\nSo to sum up, only fly JAL if you are aware their online booking can miss critical pieces of information (such as no seat selection available until flight check-in time).  When something goes wrong pre-flight, you may likely be dealing with rigid, non helpful customer service.",

But what impressed us the most was the awesome customer experience by the cabin crew. Being a vegetarian and forgetting to pre-book the meal, had little issue with the available non-veg choices but the crew was so courteous that they went over the top and made us quick vegetarian snack with the things available with them (sandwich sort of thing) and feeling so sorry about us not able to have proper meal. Had it been some other airlines, they would have hardly cared for that. Also, dazed off during breakfast meal, they put a hand written note to inform them once we awake to have meal as per need, instead of just passing by or putting the food in the seat pocket.\nSimply amazing experience.",

The food was quite enjoyable (for airlines) and the wine list had very good wines and a champagne !! The staff were very polite and helpful,  as well, we had access to the flight lounges. I recommend J.A.L. Premium to travellers, if you want a comfortable tripand 1st Class/ Business are out of your price range.",

It was amazing to see these petite ladies put all size of luggage on the overhear bin!  \n\nThe seats were a little cramp, no legroom for the tall foreigners and not comfortable for the 14hour flight.  My butt hurt for a week after we landed.  \n\nThe food was not very palatable though, especially to an American palate. cuisine is mostly geared towards Asian travelers, and no alternatives were provided.  Even the chips were seafood flavored.\n\nI used the bathrooms after we took off and i was surprised that it smelled like urine!  That was a turn off.  Otherwise, it looked clean and had enough supplies - sanitary napkin, toothbrush, etc.\n\nOverall, it was a pleasant ride!",

The window seat gives the most privacy but you (and the flight attendant) have to squeeze between the the seat next to you for access. It's a bit claustrophobic in there and the width of the seat is narrower than most. It does provide a flat bed seat and the flight attendants are great. But the plane seems old and worn out. Some of the compartments were kept closed with duct tape...no kidding. Probably the  worst plane I've been on in business class.",

        "review_text": "Premium Economy on JAL is probably the same as Business on BA.  The seats were very comfortable, there was a lot of leg room, the entertainment was great (with touch screens that actually worked).  We got given noise cancelling headphones, slippers, eye mask, ear plugs and toothbrush/toothpaste.  The service was very attentive and friendly as expected.  We also noticed that the air quality was much better in our area and much less noisy as compared with Economy (we had a stroll through to stretch our legs).  The windows had a special filter so you could still see the outside but were darkened so that we could sleep if we wanted to.  \nWe flew with our 1.5 year old son, and though it was much easier in this area with lots of room, the seat partitions and arm rests weren't movable so we couldn't lie him flat across two seats for his nap.  This would have helped him sleep a bit more comfortably.  This problem will resolve itself though once he's grown up a bit.  It is definitely worth flying this class if you want a good journey and not to become too tired on reaching your destination.  Everything was so efficient and neat, even our buggy was put in a plastic carrier bag to protect it when loading on to the plane.  The seat arrangement was 2-4-2.  It wasn't busy at all and it was nice that they didn't fill the seats by giving upgrades to Economy class (selfish, I know...) because you do have to pay quite a lot more for these seats.  We got given some nappies and snacks for our son, and his first hot meal was great.  Chicken and mash with broccoli, very good for young child.  For some reason he didn't get a second hot meal when the adults got one, which was a bit of a shame but we just shared ours with him.  It would have been great for him to have a meal with us as we used up all our spare snacks for this as well.  \nI would have given it an 'excellent' rating if we were able to use 2 seats to lie him down and for him to have had a meal with us.  If you're travelling as adults with older children then this would have definitely been excellent!",

This is total professionalism at its best as exhibited by the pilots, flight attendants, and ground staff. They may not know English very well, but will try their best to help you. They will bring you to someone who speaks English and will also show you the way. In contrast to some Chinese airlines I have tried - like China Southern airlines or China Eastern airlines - you will get a feeling that they don't care about you at all. I tried to ask help from some ground staff in Shanghai but the lady seemed annoyed at me that I couldn't speak Chinese. I look very Asian, by the way. Not only that they do not speak English well, but possibly due to a lack of training in people skills, their attitude could get very rude. So kudos to Japan Airlines! Keep doing what you do best - being respectful to everyone! I highly recommend JAL.",

It was indeed spacious. It was the most spacious economy I had ever tried, but then again, the comparison could be limited as I had flown on just SQ, Thai, Cathay, Lufthansa, ANA, Eva, China Airline, Air NZ, SilkAir and the budget air Scoot/Jet Star/Air Asia/Ex-Scoot Tiger. It felt as spacious as Scoot\u2019s business class that I taken before perhaps is due to the very slim seat design which has well thought-out features, in line with what the Japanese are famous for, their thoughtfulness and consideration for others. The meals served are on par with SQ and the air-hostess sevice are ever gracious and attentive. I would definitely start flying to Japan on JAL. Please note when booking, choose the flight that offers these JAL Sky Wider economy seat. Not all flight will have these seat and I think most of the JAL domestic flight in Japan will not have these seats.",

The seats reclined more than economy but still I feel they could improve. When the seats go back they slide into themselves so don't encroach on the person behind.The food was quite ok and the toilets always clean. Would definitely fly again with them but pick a day time flight.\nWe were lucky enough to get into the business class lounges before boarding which was an added bonus.\nWe had two different planes.",

While the entertainment options maybe fall a little short of some rival airlines, and are more geared towards the Japanese-language market (their core customer), there is still plenty of choice. The JAL Sky Suite is an excellent business-class product, but try to avoid the middle seat in center of the aircraft, because it loses out on storage cubbies compared to the other seats. It's a little annoying they turn all the cabin lights on again two hours before landing, in order to offer passengers a last meal before arrival. It means the sleep time on a flight of this duration (9 hours) isn't great.",

The footrest would not hold position when the height was adjusted and once the weight of feet were added it caused the footrest to sag, resulting in sliding down from your sitting position and this impacted on my bad back. Initially we thought it may just be an issue with the seats on that plane, however on the return flight to Sydney we had the same experience.

I would say the biggest advantage of the premium seat was having no trouble with finding luggage space in the bin above. The benefit of the lounge access was nice. The sfo lounge is very underwhelming though.  I think I would probably just buy the lounge access in the future. I am curious as to the experience on the other airlines.

About 30 minutes into the flight, when the attendants were passing out beverages I ordered my kid a soda. It was noisy, I was distracted by kid, who as a 4 year old was excited to be on a plane, and I did not realize he had given my kid a soda water until a few minutes later after he passed. I chuckled, thought it was no big deal, and passed it to my wife who asked another stewardess to exchange it for a soda. The flight attendant actually made my wife apologize for the mistake and then ignored us for the rest of the flight. I mean literally the attendant gave the guy next to me a drink and then walked away, from my frantic requests and hand signals.  It was unreal. I am guessing it was racism, as in the initial confrontation the attendant kept on using English with my wife, who is Japanese and of course spoke to her in Japanese. Between the grudge keeping flight attendants and the 787s uncomfortable seats it was a rough 13 hours. After the flight we contacted JAL to complain. They contacted the flight attendants who said they had given us special service because of their mistake. Believe me, you do not want the special service.",

The meals were tasty and the bathrooms were always clean.\n\nI am not a tall person and had adequate leg room but the seats were super hard and initially, I found it very difficult to find a spot to fall asleep in but managed to at some point during the flight.\n\nOn arrival at Haneda, I noticed that my suitcase handle was broken and went to the relative parties to report it.  The lady spoke English and was very thorough; completed all the paperwork and I was on my way.\n\nThe hard seats alone are enough for me to fly business on my next long haul if I fly with JAL again.",

The combination of the french courses and extensive wine selection ot top chef supervision were like a flying restaurant. After the turn-down service, I was able to sleep soundly dressed to the prepared pajamas. Cabin attendant gave me service in advance understand my needs. My heart was filled with the flight such as I stayed in Augerge. I was not tired at all in spite of the 12 hours of flight. British immigration was smooth in the use of fast track.I was able to spend without stress from the biginning to the end of the flight. I want to use JAL first class again.",

Service is top notch and attendants very genuine unlike the other airline *cough cough* but it could be because this is First class and this was also my flight attendant's first time in this cabin. Needless to say, every is great in terms of food and service. Wagyu beef, caviar, champagne, and bed was made when ready to sleep. IMO JAL provides the best service in the sky and staff seem very genuine in making sure you are taken good care of!",

        "review_text": "If you wonder why such a disparity between reviews, between 1 star/'terrible' and 5stars/best! its because of 'cultural insensitivity' :-).  Simply put, to understand it one needs to realize that as a rule Japanese are highly cultivated people who are generally very polite and warmhearted and would like to go out of the way to help you. Thats how Japanese are brought up. But. On the other hand they are also brought up to be ultimately loyal. Like to the company they are working for. And that means the company rules book goes before the bible. Between these two polar opposites they have to live. So here we are. If things are simple, straightforward and along the book all is perfect, you'll get wonderful service and experience. However, if anything, anything at all, is slightly off... all is crashed, nothing is going to work anymore. Don't expect any problem solving. My personal experience started with ordering tickets on line. Sure enough, no problem getting ticket LAX-Tokyo. Nice options, all crystal clear. But, alas, I need to fly to Okinawa with at least one stopover in Naha. Thats not a straight line. And here it just refuses to work properly. TIme I spent trying to make things work any way imaginary would be enough to walk to Okinawa and back. Calling customer service and asking for help to handle their web site predictably ended up with statement they don't know what is the problem with web site and offering me to pay $100 fee for the privilege to buy tickets over the phone. Even that though did not work as by the time I convinced the agent that 'stopover' means Im stopping for several days in Naha before proceeding to Ishigaki, which is also Okinawa (as island in Okinawa archipelago), which took significant efforts btw, it hit 6pm and line just went dead (seems they automatically cut it at 6:00:00pm). Maybe as well too as I already started to have images of Hawaii in my head, vs dreadful images of having a day of bad weather in Okinawa and get stranded there by JAL as that would be a problem they could not solve. Bottom line - three stars - arithmetic average of great service and absence of any problem solving.",

There is so much food available, outside from your regular meals.\nThe seat becomes a lie flat seat, which is excellent.  The only downside is that the seat cushion was hard.

I get a similar type of email stating \"The ticket purchase deadline of this reservation is August 26. Please purchase your ticket by the deadline above, otherwise the reservation will be canceled automatically after the deadline.\"  So I told customer service and she said it went through you don't have to do anything anymore.   Then I argued what about the first time I went through it?  I wanted the fare of my original booking.  So I next decided to cancel the flight I jut booked because I was only trying to prove a point of what I did and what email I got.  Then next I cancelled the flight I just put in.  So happens I only get 50% of my refund back so I lost another 250 bucks!!!!  The stupid site said I would get all my refund back but if you dig down, certain flights will have a penalty.

        "review_text": "JAL had the best schedule to reach my destination from my home. I went to their website and compared their classes of service. The website showed that \"Premium Economy\" had minor differences from \"Economy\" at 3 times the price, so I chose \"Economy.\" Booking on JAL's site proved impossible because it refused to accept numerous entries including my name, address, frequent flier number, etc. All in \"wrong format.\" So I booked the same flights with Travelocity - super easy. But Travelocity didn't give me a chance to select my seats, so I called JAL to get my seats reserved. This is 3 months ahead so should be a good choice of seats. After 2 hours - yes two hours - on hold I got a JAL agent who informed me that my class of travel does not allow seat selection until check in. The agent would not even allow me to request an aisle seat, which is essential to me for health reasons. I double-checked their web pages describing the different classes of service, and there was no mention of this difference between the two classes. There is even a section on seats, which shows pictures of the seats for the two classes, but never mentions that they will not allow advance seat selection in economy, unlike all other airlines I have flown. Some airlines charge a small fee, such as $25 for advance seat selection. In the case of JAL it would cost me over $2000 to upgrade service for these flights to get my aisle seat. To me this is inexcusable. I will not fly with JAL again.",

Beyond that, my daughter was asked if she would be willing to move because the couple wanted to give the toddler his own seat, even though only the two adults had paid seats. This was easily one of the worst BC flights I have ever been on due to these reasons. Even the earplugs provided could not drown out the yelling and screaming. I definitely recommend JAL for its service, but not for the other reasons listed.\nMy hope is that some day an airline will set age restrictions for Business/First Class and that airline will likely win me as a customer for life.",

The 787 on the Manila leg was a bit newer and slightly larger than the one on the SAN to NRT flight.\n\nSeats are comfortable with decent cushioning and leg room. They're 2 abreast on the outboard rows and are wider than most. The Dreamliners are comfortable to ride; quiet and with a 6000 foot pressured altitude. I don't care for the LCD-dimming windows. While it's nice to be able to dim the shade and still see through the window, it's slow to react to the control and keeps changing even after you release the button. An indicator for the setting would be nice.\n\nThe aisle seats on the outboard rows have a vertical metal case that takes up about 1/5 of the side-to-side leg room on the SAN/NRT flights. The Dreamliner between NRT and MNL doesn't have it.\n\nOne thing I didn't expect: When I booked this particular itinerary, I booked it through American Airlines because the trip was marginally less expensive than booking through JAL. What they don't tell you is that you can't get a seat selection until you check in. That's a bit rough when you consider the possibility of seating somewhere uncomfortable for 11-12 hours.",

It included access to an airport lounge at DFW with free snacks and beverages.  Instead of 3-4-3 across in a 777, JAL has 2-4-2 across in a 787, and the Premium Economy has 2-3-2 across.  Extra legroom in front of us, leg rest and foot rest, and the seat reclines in a shell, where it doesn\u2019t lean back into the person behind you.  The food and service were also superior.  The only minor hiccup is that JAL doesn\u2019t participate in TSA PreCheck.  In the future American Airlines should issue a boarding pass in their app, or print one at the counter with our TSA PreCheck Status, and then use the JAL boarding pass to get on the plane.",

They informed us the exact time expectancy they received from ATC, and it turned out to be pretty accurate. Food was absolutely delicious and presented nicely. My favorite has to be the limited custard pudding ice cream from Haagen Dazs, which to my understanding is served on all outbound international flights. The cabin crew was, as you would expect, amazingly nice and polite. \n\nIf there is any complaint at all, it would be the entertainment system which was a bit limited compared to the average airline. I could not turn off subtitles which bothered me a little. The provided headphones produced good sound quality but were not the most comfortable. \n\nOverall, it was a great experience flying JAL.

I contemplated the Shinkansen, but opted instead for a ride on a Japan Airlines Boeing 777 from Fukuoka to Tokyo Haneda.  For the flight I opted (JL314), they were operating a tri-class configured aircraft, with economy, J Seat and First products on board.\n\nFirst Class check-in at Fukuoka is a dream.  Located upstairs, the wood panelled check-in lounge resembles a five-star hotel.  After an efficient check-in followed by a luxe private security zone, directed me instantly into the Sakura Lounge, with terrific views across the tarmac. \n\nAfter enjoying light refreshments in the lounge, I made my way to boarding where First Class was boarded as priority through a dedicated jetway.  The dedicated F Cabin is nicely configured in a 2x2x2 staggered arrangement of fourteen recliner seats in soft cream leather, with a seat pitch of 51-inches.  Cabin crew swiftly pointed out the features of the seat, including charging points for electronic devices, and offered slippers and shoe horns.\n\nLunch was served on this short, 85-minute flight.  A single tray was offered with multiple dishes beautifully presented including rice crackers to go with a drink, a steamed salmon appetizer, a sesame tofu and crabmeat dish, and a main dish of braised chicken in a Japanese pepper soy sauce, Niigata premium steamed rice, some miso soup, and Japanese sweet.  All was absolutely delicious, light yet filling, flavoursome and rich.  For those keen on lighter options, Udon de Sky was available, as was consomme.  \n\nDrinks included apple, orange or Sunshine Juice Liquid Salad (a cold pressed smoothie of sorts, unique to JAL), colas, teas, water, iced coffee and a non-alcoholic Suntory beer.  In addition to two sakes on offer, Nicolas Feuillatte Brut 2008 champagne was available, along with a Ferrari sparkling brut wine from Italy, two white wines (Chenin blanc or a white Bordeaux) and two reds (a Temperanillo and Cote du Rhone).  Quite a nice selection covering most palates, I thought.  A premium Shochu was also available, in addition to four beers and Suntory whiskey.\n\nCrew were extremely polite, attentive and engaging.  The aircraft was immaculate and remained so throughout the flight.  The chief purser, who had personally greeted each F customer, returned as we were on stand to thank us for flying Japan Airlines.  The crew gave me a small bag containing rice crackers, as I had commented how particularly delicious their rice cracker mix was...a delightful touch.\n\nThe view of Japan from my window seat was wonderful for the duration of the flight.  It put a different perspective on compared with the train journey.  I was in a taxi at HND within 10 minutes of landing.  Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable travel experience.",

        "review_text": "JAL used to have the best Premium Economy when flying to Tokyo (compared to Air France, Alitalia and BA, all tried out), considering seats, service and pricing. In that regard this flight (return) has been clearly disappointing, in particular considering that the price for one of us was 2,400\u20ac which is clearly not a bargain for a Premium Economy seat (there was Business on Korean Air at that price but we could not have travelled together). Speaking of travelling together, this has been one of the main issue when using separate bookings. In all fairness, bookings were taken via BA, but what is the point of registering a named travel companion if this is simply ignored? We were separated both on the outbound and the return flight with in both cases ground staff unable to come up with a helpful solution. It is only once on board and largely due to the proverbial courtesy of fellow Japanse travellers that we could travel together. During these permutations it was hilarious to discover that we had not been the only coupled separated despite the moderate size of the Premium Economy cabin. As for the service, it is still competitive compared with other airlines but not as good in my view as in previous years on JAL. For instance, on the return night flight there were unusually few rounds of water and beverages. \nFor a similar price I don't think I would fly JAL PE again.",

The price is reasonable , from the Airport the staff are kind. I requested them to give me a window seat. The flight used Boeing 767 and it was also my first time to ride on that wide aircraft . I was so amazed , the seats are wide enough and theres also an entertainment were you can watch and listen to the movies and various music. They served delicious foods of course Japanese food and I enjoyed it so much. I had experience Japan automatically even im still on the plane. This December I will be flying to Japan Airlines again and that was Manila- Narita ( layover ) Haneda-Itami and KIX-Haneda(layover)Narita-Manila",

I also booked through American Airlines so I could earn mileage (AA and JAL have a partnership arrangement).  Premium Economy is a very small section of the plane between Business and Economy.  Seats give you extra legroom, lots of little freebie extras (love the slippers and free alcohol) and a pretty good recline.  Of course, not as good as First Class or Business where you get your own pods, but still appreciated.  Couldn't swing First Class or Business costs when dealing with 4 tickets.  Seats themselves weren't very comfortable but not worse than regular airlines.  Would have been nice if they had a little more padding, though.  Also a nice 'extra' with Premium Economy is that we were able to wait for our plane in the JAL lounge and that had drinks and snacks and comfortable seating which managed to pass the time nicely.  Overall, a very comfortable flight.",

Check-in was initially effected but once a plane was ready it was all efficient service with respect and a smile. Check-in was excellent. With a Premium Economy ticket, access to the business lounge is included which is a definite plus when considering flying with JAL (also offered when flying Sydney to Narita). The lounge is a little 'retro' these days, and the offerings are rather basic but it is a very nice place to spend an hour before the flight particularly as shopping options in the crowded international departure area of Narita are rather limited. The plane was very new and comfortable and overall the flight experience was very good. Seat is excellent, entertainment screen is great (I watched two movies), food is good, service is great. The premium economy experience is lessened compared to other airlines as there is no dedicated toilet, the range of snacks offered is very small with nothing exciting to nibble, and no pre-take-off drink (bubbly, juice or water) as provided by some other carriers - the missing little premium economy perks which reduce an 'excellent' rating to a 'very (very) good'. I will definitely fly JAL again.",

I was surprised with the Free Wi-Fi service they had on the flight. Although, I was a bit uncomfortable with Legroom, I expected a bit of wide space for such a long flight.The flight attendants were excellent, helpful. They had provided a huge Entertainment options on board, headphones and shawl for cold.Amazing, overall my experience with the JAL was amazing, despite the legroom thingy.",

Floors, bathrooms, kitchen are are immaculate.  \n\nThat said, their PE class is not worth it given huge price difference from China Airlines, EVA, Cathay.  $1K difference is typical.  But JAL is so clean and spacious in economy that i often fly it due to cleanliness and great flight crew.  Their service and cleanliness is direct reflection of values Japanese culture.  \n\nPhilippine airlines is the worst!  Dirty bathrooms, snooty flight staff, slow clean-up after meals (like 30-minutes last time we flew). After an almost 10-year gap, we decided to try them in Feb 2018 (LAX - MNL) since it was a quick get in and get back to San Diego in 10-days and direct connection to other parts of PI saves few hours.  A 15-hour flight and two of bathrooms in economy were unusable for half the flight.  No toilet paper, dirty, disgusting.  So big line-up in business class.  Flight attendants didn't care.  My wife is Filipina and it's embarrassing to her as it reflects badly on culture and mentality of her native land.  We've sworn off PAL for internal flights.  Their domestic flights are better, but always late (Plane Always Late = PAL is well known in PI).",

Often JAL\u2019s original Fravor with ice cream makers. Those ice creams are truly frozen solid. Every time it makes me wonder how they can keep them such good shape? They serve sliverware not plastics (Plastics will snap in half because of the solid frozen ice cream lol)\nTheir sheets are quite comfortable even for economy class. You don\u2019t feel so clogged up.\nTheir economy class sheets received some kind of world prize ( Please refer to JAL\u2019s website for the details)\nThey hardly ever delay their flights. Can be arriving a bit earlier due to the weather conditions but never been late even once when I experienced.\n\nOver all they are quite established, steady company in my opinion. And the best part is they must keep trying daily bases to hold their quality up there. May be better than yesterday but never less.\nI highly recommend JAL for the long flight!

However, flying in Premium Economy you see that while you have some choice in your meals, JAL is looking to keep their costs low.  The quality is quite good, arguably excellent and worth of mention, but you will not get much of a choice or a spread, even in Premium Economy.  In some ways, the Premium Economy product was no different than some of the business products I've experienced on US carriers, except that you had excellent service from the start at Haneda at the ticket counter to deplaning in San Francisco.",

What's more, I had the most leg room I've ever had on a standard economy ticket.",

Now I got a chance to travel to Tokyo from Delhi by this airline with lot of expectations. It was an awesome experience. The cabin, the staff, the food everything was great. Above all the humbleness of its staff is something to be experienced. The flight too was smooth barring 15-20 minutes of turbulence. The check-in process is unique and very pleasant surprise as compared to other airlines. The return flight too was equally perfect. Hats off to JAL",

        "review_text": "In Tokyo/Haneda I used a designated First Class check in counter. After passing through the security checkpoint quickly I proceeded to the JAL First Class lounge. The lounge was very spacious, but crowded a bit, and offered a good selection of breakfast food and drinks. They also had shower rooms, a champagne-bar, a room with a kicker machine and a smoking room. I enjoyed the time during my stay in this lounge! After boarding the Boeing 777-300ER I was guided to the JAL Sky Suite 1A. The cabin was not fully booked, which was not too bad. The charming crew members in the First Class cabin introduced themselves with their names and offered some drinks before takeoff. The seat was really spacious and clean, but a bit outdated, which was not a problem for me at all. There was also waiting a red amenity kit from Porsche Design. Up in the air the service started with an amuse-gueule of my special preordered japanese vegetarian menu, followed by a very delicious multi-course special meal. Every time I was served a new plate or bowl the flight attendant explained to me what it is consisting of and also the meaning in japanese cuisine. I was really surprised of the friendliness and attentiveness of the airline staff, which I enjoyed pretty much! Concerning the drinks I decided to try after the french champagne a Pommard red wine, which also was from France. After meal service was over I was handed out a pyjama and I changed my clothes in the bathroom. In the meantime my seat was converted to a comfortable bed with a mattress and very soft sheets. By the way in the bathroom they had a typical japanese toilet with a lot of the famous functions toilets have in Japan. I had a very good sleep above the clouds, although I woke up and could order a noodle soup and a pot of tea. There was served another delicious vegetarian meal before arrival in London. I even could order some stuff from the regular menu at all times. Very special for japanese airlines is, that they offer a good selection of japanese drinks like different kinds of sake wines, which I also tried a glas or two from. All in all I have to say, that JAL is a reliable and safe japanese airline, which I definetly would fly again with! This First Class flight was one of the best experiences I made in this class of service not least because of the professionalism of the cabin crew members.",

As there were only three people in the cabin, the crew recommended we move to another row so we have a full row to ourselves - so we didn't even see the other passenger. Demonstrating the service and consideration we'd see throughout the flight, they made up the empty window seats as beds, so we could comfortably move between seat and \"bed\" for the duration of the 11 hour flight. The crew were incredibly accommodating and attentive, walking us to the restrooms to change into our pajamas, talking us through the various menus and letting us alternate between the western and Japanese menu (I wanted the caviar AND sushi!). The food was astonishing and beautifully presented, and both champagne options exquisite. We'd been looking forward to the flight for a while, and it was everything we hoped for!",

The children played in the aisle - often with an adult - getting in the way of staff and passengers. Although this went on for hours, the cabin crew did nothing to intervene. Given JAL\u2019s otherwise high standards, this was very disappointing. \n\nAn additional point with JAL is that the cabin temperature is set quite high.

The seats can fully lay off without disturbing the back customers and are perfectly fine and comfortable for tall people like me by the way I am 1.88 Meter.\n\nEntertainment in the plane has a wide selection but the bad point is that outbound and inbound are the same, therefore I got a little bored after a while. As for the food, wise is not fantasy but still good.\n\nLanguage is an issue to many of us as we don't speak Jap but what I have encountered is that the staff have lots of patients and even will go and look for someone who can speak English to assist us on the issues we have.\n\nAs our flight is being delayed but we reach the airport early during the return flights but the staff who can't speak well in English got a friend who is going off duty to help, this lady not only help us to change to an earlier flight and ensure all the processes in.",

        "review_text": "Booked direct flights from New York to and from Tokyo on a JAL Boeing 777.  The price of direct tickets was only a few hundred more than flights with connections, so it was a no brainer.\n\nI am a nervous flyer, but the flight to Tokyo was smooth as butter.  We flew north from New York, through Canada, over the Bering Straight down through the coast until reaching Tokyo. Magically, this 13 hour flight over some pretty active weather regions, was buttery smooth.  \n\nThere was a generous amount of legroom in economy class, and a 6\u201d 1\u2019 ,  I was able to extend both legs fully beneath the seat in front of me.\n\nThe entertainment systems were OK.  A very good selection of movies, but the music and video games were basic.  The video games, especially, were poor\u2014 equivalent to bad cell phone games 10 years ago.  Singapore Airlines has much better games, actually using Nintendo brand.\n\nThe food was passable.  Dinner consisted of a Japanese meal (rice, 3 sides, and a meat).  Dessert was pleasant\u2014- a cup of Haagen Daaz ice cream.\n\nThe return flight was a bit bumpier, but the staff told us right at the start to expect some light turbulence, and made an in flight announcement before hitting a rough patch in the North Pacific.   This really helped to settle my nerves.\n\nAll in all, an almost perfect flying experience.",

The quality and space of seat in Premium Economy is almost as good as the old style business-class (before the sleeper seats were introduced) and definitely worth the money.

The entertainment system is excellent and easy to use. Premium Economy customers can also use the airport lounge. My only criticism is the relatively poor standard of English and JAL's insistence of its staff \"squeaking\" in as high a tone of voice as is humanly possible when making announcements - extremely annoying and antiquated (JAL management need to revise this policy and move into the 21st century!)",

The inflight entertainment is very good, with touch screen functions. Food service is very good quality for economy class, and I especially liked their campaign to feature young and rising chefs in Japan to come up with appetizers, main dish, desert etc., with a touch of Japanese innovation and tradition.Cabin attendants were very attentive to passengers and take care of their requests quickly and nicely. I am not surprised they are voted the best economy class by Skytrax for the second time. Most highly recommended for those who want space and quality in the economy class.",

I have been spoiled by always flying into HND, and since this airline is a government monopoly, you would think they'd offer it to HND, but no NRT it is.  We bought Business seats since first is NOT available EVER on this particular flight.  We were excited to fly the 787, but alas JAL put \"SHELL FLAT NEO\" seats in the plane.  These are the most uncomfortable \"business seats\" ever.  They are narrow and don't even lay out a normal angle for sleeping.  They were world class business seats 2 decades ago.  Why JAL would put this crap in a new plane is beyond me, but for an 11 hour flight it was torture.  The flight attendants smile alot but beyond that there is not much communication.  On the way home, delayed yet again, we had seats 1D and 1G.  These seats should be torn out, as inexplicably there is NO storage overhead whatsoever and since its a bulkhead, no place to put anything.  Ridiculous to have to fight with other passengers to put a bag overhead.  The food was not good and service uneven.  I have never seen flight attendants drop so many things. At one point a dinner roll went careening down the aisle.  The clanking and dropping of dishes in the galley was obnoxious for like 8 hours straight.

Did not realise that one has to change airports Narita to Haneda , which involved getting transit visa and additional cost of changing airports with luggage. On adding up the costs it was expensive compared to other airlines. \n   Once I had booked my tickets it was impossible to contact the Japan airlines on phone. Also tried through an acquaintance in Japan he also could not contact the airlines on phone. I wanted to extend my stopover in Tokyo from 1 day to 3 days but could not contact the airlines through various means. \n   The flight was comfortable with good leg room. The food served was tasty, the flight experience was good.\n... Anand",

        "review_text": "We were on a Japan Airlines flight to Narita from Vancouver recently. The in-flight service in the economy cabin \u00a0was \u00a0unquestionably better than most of the airlines we have experienced in our travels to Asia and Europe from North America. The cabin crew were so polite and courteous and the meals were outstanding.\n\nDue to severe winds at Narita our flight was diverted to Haneda Airport and as a result we missed our connection to Singapore from \u00a0Narita. When we finally got to Narita, we had to line up for more than 4 hours to get another flight to \u00a0Singapore. We were tired, thirsty and hungry and only after some complaining we did get some water from the ground staff about 2 hours after we started waiting in line. Since our new connecting flight was some \u00a012 hours away, we managed to get hotel accommodation from Japan Airlines. We could take a shuttle bus to go to the hotel but we were told that the airline policy was not to provide shuttle transportation from the hotel back to the airport and the airline would also not provide any meals. After some more complaining we were given 2000 yen for return transportation but we could not get any meal vouchers. \u00a0We \u00a0finally checked in at the hotel at 1:30 in the morning and everything was shut. We had to wait till early morning before we could get some snacks\u00a0from a store outside the hotel. \n\nObviously we can only blame mother nature for the inability to land at Narita on time to make our \u00a0connection but we think Japan Airlines \u00a0could have done more for the totally exhausted customers who had to wait in line for hours.",

I rather wish I'd booked through JAL, because PE travelers have business lounge access both at ORD and NRT. I did not because I booked through American Airlines.  In addition, the gate crew at ORD was American Airlines, so of course they were abrupt, and boarding was confusing and ill-managed. The flight itself was great, other than the fact that I found the PE seat unusually uncomfortable compared to EVA, Qantas, Cathay, or Lufthansa, for example. It's one of those seats that slides forward in a shell to keep from invading the space of the person behind you, but I found that it placed the weight directly on my tailbone, which more than a week later is still aching. Food was ok but not great, and the selection of movies was fine without being outstanding.  I think in all all in all that I would not go out of my way to fly JAL in Premium Economy again, if there's a convenient Cathay or EVA flight.",

They were good in everything starting from boarding till debarkation. It was amazing to see how efficient they were on boarding, for example. They reserved 30 minutes for it and finished 8 minutes earlier. It was the same on my connecting flight in Tokyo. Both flights departed earlier thanks to it and arrived to their destinations much earlier as well. All in-flight services were very good, the aircraft were new and very modern, the crew was very nice and responsive, the food was the best I have ever had on long flights. The aircraft cleanliness deserves a special mentioning. It was outstanding. It looked like the toilets, for example, were cleaned after every visitor. It is worth mentioning as well that they were in line with Japanese standards that was astonishing to see on the aircraft. I think that a small addition to in-flight amenities would make this airline even better that their 5 star competitors. What I missed on their flights were small things like night socks, air plugs, mouth wash, skin conditioner, razor and other accessories.",

We were thoroughly entertained by the movies provided on our personal tv screen. Food was good. The fligh stewardess made my kids very, very pleased by giving them a souvenior from JAL. And before giving my kids their drinks, the flight stewardess drew a Doraemon face on their cups. It made the children feel special. We had a delay in our flight and the ground staff of JAL handled the situation very well. I did not see one grumpy passenger. We had to take a connecting flight and I am pleased to say the quality of service is the same. Kudos to JAL for setting such a high standard for flying in comfort.",

They need much more of a Japanese theme to their meals.\n\nThere was no priority queue to board the flight, but to my surprise the ticket did include access to the Qantas Business Class Lounge in Sydney, which was a great start, as we felt very relaxed and somewhat privileged!\n\nI'm not sure I'd fly JAL again, as it was clearly inferior to my PE experience with Cathay Pacific in late 2017.",

Food is a little better and you can have champagne, but the footrest of the seat is awkward. I could not find a good sleeping position at any point during the flight.

I was was told there was over a 90 min wait for the showers which put the vacant time at the same time as my boarding. With 10 mind to go I enquired again and was now told that there was at least another 20 min wait. The member of staff running this apologised but offered no alternative. So I enquired at the front desk and they suggested I try the American Airlines lounge. So I rushed over there, found their lounge empty and was able to have a shower before my flight. Why did JAL staff not tell me of this option sooner. The flights themselves were good. I found the seat comfortable. I recommend odd row seats a and K as these are the good window seats. JAL use the BA lounge is Boston which was good. Funny that the jumper was offered on the day flight to Boston but not on the return flight from Boston. Ask and it might be offered. All flight crew were delightful.",

While it's not super fast, it's nice not be charged for it, especially when flying first class.  Check in at JFK was a breeze. Very friendly staff had us on our way in less than 5 minutes. She then walked us to a special lounge adjacent to security. There two helpful airport employees helped us remove our electronic devices and carried them to the front of the security line. A special TSA employee checked our passports an boarding passes. Not sure how this works- I guess the airline pays for this service. Shortly after take off we were given very comfortable pajamas and a nice amenity kit. The seats are wide and soft leather and will be made up into a bed anytime you request it. What was nice is they lay out a soft cushion and provide a down comforter. The lie flat bed is over 6 feet and I was able to stretch out very comfortably. The Japanese set menu for lunch was delicious. There were a number of small dishes followed by the main course and a wonderfully sublime dessert. The cabin staff is always smiling and are always ready to provide anything you want. The bathrooms are cleaned each time someone uses it. Overall, this has been a very positive experience.",

They seem to actually LIKE doing things for you!  So different from surly staff encountered on other flights.  Love this airline.  Even the ground crew wait in an  orderly line and bow and wave  you off as you taxi the tarmac!  Food isn't too  bad either and plenty of it.  We love the seats at the back near where the staff sit.  It's quiet and plenty of room to stand without disturbing anyone else.  We travel a lot and after this great second flight we will always look first to JAL before booking flights.  For long haul flights this is the airline to use! The only negative I can think of is if you need to call  JAL before your flight.

For amenities i love the cabin slippers and in the washroom love the individual mouth wash packets.  Oral care is so important when traveling. The drink menu was my highlight with sake's and umeshu as options and for dining i opted for Japanese cuisine presented beautifully.  A great way to travel to Japan.",

The seats and legroom were pretty standard and I believe two of our flights were delayed but I think the good service helped me look past all of that. I loved our food on the flight to Asia and the food on the flight back wasn't bad either. They have young chefs that create the meals and they include a little bio about these emerging chefs with the meals which I thought was a nice little touch. I've flown Singapore Airline for a flight to Asia before and that was obviously top notch but I would say this is a good second place.",

Similar to my previous report - JAL cannot be trusted and don't bother trying to argue with JAL airline staff whose English is quite poor and obviously do not understand the real meaning of honouring code-share partners as part of their One World partnership. I am guessing we will have the same problems all the way home again - jiggidy-jig-rigged !  Off to have another arguement with JAL about my return flights ... wish me luck!",

        "type_of_route": "International",
        "review_text": "I hope that this review helps you because it contains information that I wish I had read prior to flying with JAL, which I have decided is the best airline I have ever flown with, despite a lot of difficulty at first concerning being seated with my spouse for a very, very long flight, from San Francisco to Haneda, Tokyo to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and back. \n\nI booked on JAL's website, full-price for two economy seats, not on a code share. At the end, I expected to be able to select seats, but I was not given this option. This is not too uncommon for American carriers. Often you have to wait until 72 hours or however long to select them online. But because my husband has a painful medical condition which required him to be on medication while flying, I wanted to be seated next to him to be able to assist him with coping. He is fine to fly, medically, but his condition does require meditation and coping skills, which I have been trained to assist him with, and again, requires that he be on medication, so he is a little \"out of it\" when he flies. We picked JAL for our first long flight due to its outstanding reputation. However, we are not wealthy people, so we had no real choice except to fly economy.\n\nJAL wound up being a FANTASTIC airline. But their customer service phone line and seat selection is horrible, and we will fly with them again in the future because we intend to go to Japan and several other places in Asia, especially after he found the flight tolerable for his condition. But I will get to the good part of the review AFTER the more negative and frustrating part.\n\nSo, after I had entered my credit card information, I was unable to select seats for us. As anyone would, I immediately called their phone number, which in the U.S. entailed waiting and waiting and waiting for many hours, dropping connection several times, and taking days to get through. I considered cancelling the flight but felt with JAL's reputation that once we reached someone, it would be resolved. Finally, I did reach a customer service person on the phone, and I was told I could check in prior to the flight, online, 72-hours in advance, and we could get seats together. I briefly mentioned a medical issue being the core of my concerns, but I did not belabor it, simply trusting in the process and reputation of the airline. \n\n72 hours prior to the flight, I logged in and was unable to select seats still. I again called JAL's customer service number, and I received the information that it was 24-hours in advance, and to be sure to log in to the moment. I queued up to log in to the website, which was extremely complicated to use, with many different pages nested strangely, but I managed to log in within one minute after 24 hours, and there were no two seats next to one another. We had been seated separately. My spouse began to have a tremendous amount of fear and to suggest cancelling the entire three-week, pre-paid vacation to Vietnam. I called again to the JAL customer service number, again waited (in total, I believe I called and waited for about 7 hours over about five months to JAL's customer service people). I finally got through to a representative who said there was nothing he could do, he was terse, and he said we should arrive at the airport early. \n\nWe live almost three hours from the airport, but we arrived four hours early anyways. There was a customer service agent at the check-in counter for JAL, fortunately, but she was unable to assist and said she could only \"make a recommendation.\" We waited in the line so that we were first to check-in for another hour, and then the next customer service agent said the flight was overbooked, and she could not assist either, but to ask at the gate. At this point, my spouse looked like he was not going to get on the flight at all, but he soldiered onwards. I was so profoundly disappointed that nothing we had done had helped us simply get seats next to one another so that I could comfort him during a painful, stressful time. At boarding, they again could not assist us, and so we boarded the flight in separate cabins. \n\nI found myself in a middle, side seat next to what appeared to be two fairly young people, perhaps college aged, and I wound up asking the young man next to me if he would switch seats for a price, and what price it would be, and I said I would with extreme sincerity that I would not be upset if he said no because it was a long (11 hour) flight. He said for $200, he would allow my husband to sit in his seat, so I gave him $200, and they switched. I think that was a fair price. I would have been happy to give it directly to JAL, but they did not allow us to upgrade or anything. \n\nMy husband found his condition considerably less painful than expected, much to our tremendous joy! And he enjoyed the flight. He loved JAL as did I. We flew from SFO-Haneda-HCMC and then from Hanoi-Narita and took the limo bus to Haneda-SFO, so that's quite a lot of flight time with JAL. We enjoyed every moment with them, and my husband found his medical situation tolerable for a flight of this length! So we will assuredly be taking more JAL flights, and we even signed up as members. \n\nI asked, finally, why we couldn't switch flights since I could not find anything online about this except for people using miles or on codeshares, and I wanted to avoid the problem in the future. The JAL in Tokyo easily explained that the economy flight we selected was something called N-class, a term I don't exactly know or understand, but it must have mentioned it to me somewhere during my booking and meant nothing to me at all since it's not a familiar code. So my review is to let you know a few things, as a traveler:\n\n1.) If you want to sit together for a flight, do not book N-class flights on JAL -- not only can you not change your seat, you also cannot even upgrade\n\n2.) JAL has serious customer service problems on their phone lines in the US and have room for improvement there\n\n3.) Take JAL anyways! I always fly economy, I always hate flying, and JAL is absolutely the best airline I have ever taken. The food is amazingly good with a wide and changing menu plus great drinks and everything is free, the staff on-board are incredibly nice and professional, the seats are comfortable and large, even in economy, the in-flight entertainment is excellent, with top U.S. films that change regularly, they give you real pillows and blankets, the captains were kind and present upon boarding, the actual boarding process was a breeze, the airport at Haneda is easily my favorite airport in the world due to the great shopping, food, and concept in pre-boarding, and Narita is also an incredible hub with a train station to Tokyo or Narita right underneath and luggage check (everyone is so kind and friendly and helpful), and the entire plane is comfortable and classy and clean, with a large percentage dedicated to sleeping seats. It felt like luxury, or maybe just civility, to be able to fly this way, as though we were flying back in the early 80's when airlines still took a sense of pride in their work as more than just cattle cars. \n\nBut I will find a way to ever avoid N-class tickets again. I don't quite understand yet what these are, but I will be Googling soon. \n\nAlso, avoid the bassinet row. That's where we sat, a few rows behind the bassinets, which is where they (wisely) offer families with young babies seating. \n\nOn the way back from Hanoi, incidentally, there was no way at all to check in online for anyone in economy, but in that case, we arrived to the airport four hours early again, and we got the best economy seats on the plane since we were first. In the U.S., being first did not assist at all.\n\nI believe that they always do put families together? That seemed their priority. A grown husband with a medical condition who was still cleared to fly seemed a little harder to explain the urgency about. But all's well that ends well. We are now JAL members! And if you can afford the lie-down seating, I would take that, although I didn't find much difference that I could see between priority-economy and economy (we flew in economy).\n\nI do sincerely hope they improve their phone customer service and website; both are beneath the status of this carrier.",

First, the service was as good as Or even better than SQ. Secondly, they were extremely caring and customer centric. Mine was a midnight flight and my experience with other airline was meal served after two hrs regardless of the timing. But JAL only served small snack after we come aboard and served breakfast two hr before landing. This allowed the passenger to get enough sleep. I must commend their seats - more spacious than many other airlines. It was comfortable but only thing is their cushion was a bit hard.\n\nWhen we reached Tokyo for a domestic transit, we just need to deposit the checked in luggage after we cleared the custom. And the luggage can be picked up at your destination airport. Very customer centric and make it convenient for us.\n\nI will go for JAL from now onwards whenever I am travelling to Japan.",

We can compare this to past flights. The flight was delayed 6 1/2 hours and we were not informed. Japan Airlines does not have it's own well stocked business class lounge in JFK. This was totally unexpected. The lounge was overfilled and we went to another lounge at the airport. The design of the business class seats were designed after a rectangular casket with a hard floor. They ran out of food. Seems as though I am whining but it was not worth the extra expense and could have done better.",

There were less English movie choices but it was interesting to watch the Japanes movies. \n\nOverall, its the little things that made this flight more comfortable than my usual flights. I liked the array of pockets in front where I can store water, gadgets and magazines separately. Service was lovely. Flight attendants were always nice and respectful despite the long flight. Best of all, bathrooms were remained pristine even at the tail end of the flight, with toothbrushes and ammenities laid out of you inside. Will definitely book JAL next time I fly west coast",

This has to go through via email and phone call to make this small change. We believed this needed to be improved in term of online application system should auto once we have choosed correct gender.\n\nNevertheless, JAL boarding check in counter was a hassle free with quick n tip top check in services.

Price wise we choose JAL due to the luggage allowance (2 pc @ 26kg checked plus  7kg carry on - a no brainer since we take our own ski gear). We like the large variety of food although the actual food service is somewhat slow due to their attentiveness of each customer. The staff are kind, friendly and helpful.",

This was particularly important on this flight as I was astonished to be just 1 of 3 women amongst more than 30 male travelers in this cabin and therefore valued the privacy.  I also thought that the flight attendants pandered to the male passengers or maybe it was because they were more demanding.\nI was thankful that the privacy factor was so good in this aircraft configuration, and I really like the personal suite entry \u201c corridor\u201d meaning there are no legs to step over.\nHaving used JAL Business many times over the years my only other disappointment is their menus which always consist of a \u201cJapanese\u201d or \u201cWestern\u201d menu.  The choice rarely deviates from fish or beef which I find monotonous.\nHowever, this airline has an impeccable schedule. It has the ability to depart an airport up to half an hour late yet arrive at its destination on time.  I also find all their schedules socially friendly and connect well.  Their prices too are good value against the top tier airlines yet seat and cabin comfort is in many cases, superior.\nExcellent comfort and value.",

Of course everyone has a right to travel but my question is whether they support dangerous seating conditions with tow. Able bodied people to now have to navigate over someone who can\u2019t move out of their seat. If there was an emergency or fire where evacuation was required we would be stuffed literally!! He wouldn\u2019t be able to get out in time and we would have to physically get over him or assist him to get out. This is a highly dangerous situation which Japan Airlines condones. Unfortunately Qantas did a very similar thing before and after complaining realised it was a fault in their system that shouldn\u2019t allow it. \n\nVery disappointed with Japan Airlines.

Although it was an 8 am flight, there was no breakfast but lunch was served 2 hours into the flight. The only other meal served  was a small snack at about 2 hours before we landed. Of course there were no lovely Singapore Girls attending to us but the stewardess were very warm, sincere and polite. Service was very good.

What we didn't realise is that even though it was clearly a JAL booked itinerary, nevetheles one section was (covertly!) co-partnered with British Airways who cancelled their flight - throwing our itinerary to buggery. What was a one stop travel intinerary has now become three stops; what was only 24 hours travel has become filled with lengthy lay-overs extending the travel up to a possible 40 hours! Given JAL's short notice and a conference committment, there was no option for us to cancel and JAL has not indicated any compensation arguing that it was BA's fault who argued that it was JAL's fault - with no real explanation. This \"corporate aerial ping-pong\" with no apology or compensation is seriously frustrating and distressing which indicates a lack of care for customers who become vulnerable victims at the mercy of JAL's/BA's corporate whims - which actually costs customers time and money having to adjust budgets, accommodation, reorganise work and meeting schedules and even family committments, etcetera, etcetera. JAL/BA it is not good enough!  We, your customers, demand that you stick to your committments, accept responsibility and the consequences of your actions (that can decimate your customer's plans) and compensate us accordingly rather than cowardly whimping and leaving your customers to pay for your mistakes!",

As usual, the Crew was very attentive, continues flow of drinks and food. Love the cup Udon, Haagen-Dazs ice-cream, and bread.  Cabin temperature was just right.  The award-winning Prawn Curry rice was good too.",

Short trip from Gimpo to Haneda but flew in a huge Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner that had lots of leg room and great meal service which was unexpected considering the flight was only 2.5 hours.\n\nFor the money we paid about double what it would normally cost but that was because we were heading to Tokyo for the cherry blossom viewing (sakura).\n\nLuckily we had already eaten at the airport lounge and did not have too much to eat on board.\n\nOn time performance and easy gate location on both ends made the flight that much more enjoyable.",

The cabin crew are very attentive to all the passengers and always smiling. Our seats are wider as compared to other airlines, the cabin smells fresh. The food they served is what i liked best, i have no complain with the quantity and the quality. They start serving the miso soup before they serve the main entree, and you can ask for more soup until you're satisfied. The last they serve is ice cream aside from the dessert included on the food tray. Coffee and tea are non-stop and i even requested for decaf for dinner. My only complain on our 2nd flight was the washroom because towards the end of the flight it was already dirty. Maybe because it was a very full flight and the attendants were so busy attending to all the needs of the passengers that's why they had no time to make-up the washroom. I hope it will not be the same on our next flight back to manila this coming august. Nevertheless, it's still our favorite airline and we'll keep on using it as long as they offer reasonable rate.",

The route traverses Russia/Siberia near the north pole and the experience and scenery itself is a treat. Helsinki is a sort of northern version of the middle east transit terminals, but much more relaxed and less frantic. There are two stops at Tokyo and Helsinki but the waiting time was short.  The trip only took an extra 2 hours compared to the middle east routes and in my opinion is worth the extra time. The business class prices were several thousand dollars cheaper than the comparable middle east routes. The planes are modern and the cabin crew service was excellent.",

There are two at NRT airport. The one next to Custom/Immigration is more crowded than the other side of terminal 2.  The only notable difference between two locations was sushi.  The other side did not offer it.  But if you like less crowded, more relaxed environment, I\u2019d recommend the far side lounge.  \n\nDeparture/arrival were on time.  As always, JL offered one of the best services in the class.  I like the mattress, availability of extra blanket, many food options, and you can eat whenever you feel like up to two hours before arrival.  Entertainment system is top notch.

Also miso soup as well. Then they even served H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream. \n\nAfter a little nap, they came around with delicious sandwiches. And then finally another meal before we landed. This time it was pasta with the most delicious creamy sauce. Totally worth not counting the calories on this flight. It surely made this long flight seem very short. \n\nOur returning flight from Narita to JFK was exactly the same, as in great.  However this time around they pulled off entirely different meals. Except for the beverages and miso soup, everything else was completely different and completely delicious. And this was in economy class\u2026 Can you imagine what they serve up in first class?\n\nThe flight attendants were cordial, kind, efficient and pleasant. \n\nIn-flight entertainment system was great as well. Dozens and dozens of movies and TV shows.\n\nIf we ever have the chance to go back to Japan, we know we will only be flying Japan Airlines.",

Also, it's a lot cheaper and quicker to travel to Haneda than Narita. Even a taxi is affordable if you have luggage. The airport is also quieter and smaller with only 1 international terminal. If you can sleep on the plane the timing is good and easier to recover from jet lag. Finally it's in the same club as BA so you still get your air miles.

Both the outbound BKK - Osaka (KIX) and inbound from NRT were 787-8 Dreamliner, but the biz class configuration differed.  The outbound to Osaka was the traditional 2-2-2 JAL shell flat seat without partitions, which I thought was dated.  The return flight from Tokyo featured their Sky Suite, which was a great deal better. Recommendation is still for aisle seats if two of you are traveling together. \n\nBoth flights were on time. On board service excellent.  Food pretty good.   Met all expectations that I would expect from a Japanese carrier.\n\nTwo criticisms. First was the limited English language capability at Narita Airport check in counter. One would have thought....And secondly, for some unexplained reason (which remains unexplained by JAL to this day), I couldn\u2019t pre select seats on my return flight to Bangkok on JAL website.  \n\nWill certainly fly JAL again, if the price is right.  Otherwise have to stick to Star Alliance for mileage purposes.",

        "review_text": "On our most recent flight from Japan to LA, we decided to fly by Japan Airlines from Narita. Transportation to Narita was quick and easy, we used the Airport Limousine bus, which stops at many hotels in the Tokyo area. \n\nWe boarded the bus at the ANA Intercontinental Hotel, the cost for the bus is less than taking the Narita Express, and frees you from having to push your way through Tokyo Station, and navigate nearly half a dozen escalators.\n\nThe bus dropped us off right in front of the terminal. The line at the check-in counter moved quickly. The staff, noticing our stroller (we were traveling with our three-year-old daughter) opened an additional terminal to get us through more quickly. \n\nSecurity was efficient and polite. When the flight was ready to board, we were allowed to get on early. We found our economy seats large and roomy, with lots of foot room, the size you might expect on \u201ceconomy-plus\u201d at another airline. Each seat had a blanket, pillow, and headphones.\n\nThe in-flight entertainment monitor had a good selection of movies, games, and music. However, the headphone jack was the kind usually found on airplanes, the two-pront variety. It worked well with the cheap airline headphones, but I had to be careful not to bump the jack when using my Bose QC headphones, or the sound would cut off.\n\nOur flight left the terminal on-time, but it took nearly 20 minutes of taxiing before we finally took off. \n\nThe larger seats and headroom were much appreciated on our 10 hour flight to LA (and even more appropriated on the 11-and-a-half hour return flight. The flight passed quickly enough. The in-flight meal was airline-mediocre, but we had brought food for the flight from a shop at the terminal. \n\nArrival al Los Angeles was painless, and we got through immigration and customs quickly. The only problem we had was our Primetime shuttle, which never arrived to pick us up (or half a dozen other people who were also waiting). We had to spend $120 for a taxi to get to our hotel in Orange County. Avoid Primetime Shuttles at all cost. A month later, they still haven\u2019t refunded our payment, though they promised an immediate refund.\n \nGetting back to our flight, Japan Airlines gave us comfortable seats, good service, and a reasonable price. I highly recommend them.",

The food is at par, exceptionally great like those middle eastern airlines, well prepared, very good presentation, sumptuous and worth the calories.  However in the amenities side, JAL lags behind, double row window seats and quad row for the aisle no privacy, despite the \"raising\" divider. Your seat sinks to the ground when you want recline you could imagine the dirt on floor near your face. I think JAL is old plane and should be retired, those middle eastern airline are much superior in comfort and price much lower.  So would I take JAL, maybe if its a new plane that offers single row window seats that doesn't sink to the floor!",

So forked out additional SGD400 to get better comfort. It's all worth the extra money as they allow to use lounge,give priority for luggage, additional amenity and significant legroom compared to economy class. However, boarding was together with economy which I thought could be \"adjusted\" in the near future. \n\nI flew other airlines but JAL has two additional features which I don't see in other aircraft: 1) tiny foothold under everyone's seat which crew used to step and reach out to overhead compartment. Normally I would just step on the seat :( 2) mirror in overhead compartment which allows you to see if any luggage was left out without the need to peak inside. This feature is very helpful for petite and short individuals. \n\nFood was good and sufficient entertainment to survive any flight. One disheartened event for me is when JAL refused to compensate my damaged baggage claim. Definitely wouldn't fly JAL again due to its high price and unwillingness to extend customer service.",

The seats were wide, the table big, the food really good and the amenity kit helped me on a couple of good hours of sleep. No problems with space for my legs (I'm 187cm) and I also enjoyed the size of the IFE screen. Only minus was that the in flight announcements cut right through the movie I was watching, at a non-adjustable volume. Which was really loud with my headphones. Otherwise highly recommended.",

Top notch! When I went to the toilet, I saw the stewardess took a big bamboo pot of rice out and mix them so you can imagine fresh hot white sushi rice. Since mine was a night flight, I went for a snack food Japanese style - it is served to me in a 3 small course bento ish with rice. Surprise to see that much of food. After 7 hours flight, they start serving lunch where I chose Japanese meal. This comes with a bento of cold sushi and other cold dishes follow by main course where I had a grilled salmon with rice and some condiments. I totally enjoyed my flight experience on Japan Airlines. The only downside for this airline is the headset - it doesn't really provide that much soundproof and I didn't like the way they packaged them up in a cheap plastic bag. Would love if they could put in a nice headset cover as if you are using the BOSE headset. Overall: I give 9/10 on my experience.",

You're spoiled for choice. \n\nThe staff are incredibly friendly and polite. I didn't get on with the food on both flights and the staff were very apologetic, and as we were departing they apologised again! Really great service.\n\nThe main downfall unfortunately is the food (except for the Soba noodles on the return flight!). There are very odd combinations and if you're near the back of the plane, the only decent sounding option is unavailable (1 choice was fried chicken or prawn curry, can you guess which one was left over?!).\n\nAll in all, I would definitely fly with JAL again, but I'd make sure to bring some snacks!",

In the air, JAL had the same high level of service as we experienced previously.  The premium economy seats are comfortable, have great leg/calf support, as well as a foot rest.  Since the seats slide forward rather than recline backwards, there is no problem within a reclining seat interfering with the monitor or tray table.\n\nFood continues to be extremely good.  Well presented, favorable, and high quality.  There are several choices in addition to snack service and a snack bar.  If you go hungry its your own fault.\n\nThe flight attendants are attentive, pleasant and appear to really enjoy serving their guests.  Yes I use the word guests rather than passengers.

        "review_text": "I was expecting refined service, and comfort in JAL business class, but found neither!!!\nCabin crew was mostly matter of fact, or indifferent ( with one exception). One does not feel welcome as on other flights from different airlines. \nMore important, six hours into the flight, I had an excrutiating pain in my right leg (not a leg cramp) and called the hostess who had no idea what to do!!! \nThankfully, one of them knew about thrombosis and got me 6 pillows to help raise my leg and drain the blood. \nSo, I do feel most JAL stewardesses are unresponsive and untrained for emergencies!\nLayout for Business Class Cabin is charmless, extremely partitioned. It felt like a cheap office building and made me claustrophobic\nSeating was not entirely comfortable as I felt squeezed, like in a cubicle\nEntertainment quality is good, but TV screens are way too big for the space!!!  It's overwhelming and you can't help being bothered by your neighbours' lit screens while you're trying to sleep!\nPoor air quality\nPoor accessories: eyemasks turn hot when you open the package which is absurd and not relaxing, especially when the cabin feels stuffy. They should be cold, if anything; so I could not use it to block the light from a TV across the aisle!!!\nAll in all, JAL Business Class was inferior to that of other airlines I've flown. \nI was very dissapointed and will not fly them again, nor recommend them to anyone!\nOn the positive side, ckeck in was fast, and the food was excellent.",

Now that is service in its upmost best...I was too much in a hurry and didnt get their names, but I wish Japan Airlines reads this review and commends the two special staff members, one lady and one young gentleman that helped me so very much!

First the pluses:\n\n1) The SkySuite seat was good for sleeping, and with a window seat provides great privacy.\n2) The plane was very clean.\n\nIn relative terms, many negatives though:\n\n1) The food (Japanese meal) was pretty bad.  Not as bad as some other airlines in business class (e.g. British Airways) but easily worse than most American carriers for a comparable length international flight in business class.  The food was overcooked, much worse than what you'd get in a moderately good Japanese restaurant in Boston.\n\n2) Service was basically on request only.  The mandatory service items (meals, duty free, etc.) were offered, but nothing pro-actively beyond that.  If you rang the call bell and asked they were happy to comply but compared to, for example, JetBlue Mint, the service level was much worse.\n\n3) The lounge in Narita on my return trip (Sakura Lounge) was just plain bad.  No food other than rice crackers and cheese balls, and very crowded.\n\n4) The amenity kit and other onboard amenities were very basic.  For example no moisturizer in the kit or in the bathrooms.  The blanket offered was very thin and not warm at all.\n\n5) No storage available at the seat at all.  The only option during takeoff/landing is storing all items in the bins.\n\nOverall I would choose just about any other airline over JAL for a business class flight, unless you have no choice on the route.  In my case they offer the only nonstop, so I don't have other good options.",

Our friends, on complaining were advised that the Flight was fully booked and it would not be possible to make any changes.\nFortunately, when I spoke to the staff requesting that my husband and I could be seated together, it seemed to take a short phone call and we were re-allocated new seats side by side and with the bonus of plenty of leg room. Needless to say our companions were not impressed.\nOther than that we had little to complain about and we did enjoy having metal cutlery to use for our meals. We did wish the plane could have been scheduled to arrive into Changi at a more sociable hour as it was not great to reach our Hotel at 2am to find we had been transferred/upgraded because of maintenance issues.

        "review_text": "I booked my tickets through British Airways from London to Tokyo and was really excited when I saw they partnered with Japan airlines for my stopover in Frankfurt on my return to London for a business meeting. I arrived early on the day I was to fly because strangely they didn\u2019t allow me to book my seats in advance like British airways does.  When I asked the very polite girl at the desk if I could sit with my business partner she couldn\u2019t have been more polite to offer two middle seats one in the front of the other thinking that would suffice. She was sneaky about it to because when I asked she implied it would be no problem, printed the tickets and was starting to load my luggage. However when I looked at the numbers I noticed they weren\u2019t in the same row and asked where these were. Again with a sweet little smile she politely said they are in the middle seats one in front of the other. I was a bit confused. Since I\u2019m almost six feet tall and needed to be seated next to my colleague to discuss our strategy and meeting agenda I asked again if she could please reconsider and give us two,seats \u201ctogether, side by side\u201d. Again she was very polite, made a phone call but only had the middle and maybe a window seat but nothing together.  I explained we were on business and asked her if we could possibly upgrade to business since I have a ton of miles and she said no. They don\u2019t take BA miles even though they are partners (some partnership). I asked if I could buy an upgrade and again was told no. I became frustrated and practically begged the woman for anything but the middle seat. She had the one window seat which I gave to my colleague and then she just got rude with me and told me to either accept the middle seat and get out or just move on and get nothing. I explained I didn\u2019t understand why she wouldn\u2019t let me pay for an upgrade but she just got more obstinate and told me to speak to British airways. I asked where the BA desk was and she didn\u2019t want to tell me. She just said it\u2019s in the terminal (which by the way is the size of six jumbo jets). The frosting on the cake was when she said with a smile and her most polite voice  \u201cis there anything else I can do to help you?\u201d.  I was floored! Seriously, what help? She made it clear she was not going to help me nor did she want to help me. Help me off a bridge maybe. She was very rude and left me feeling like a criminal. I left after that and walked around aimlessly to find BA but couldn\u2019t. I later found out that BA doesn\u2019t open until 1pm (my flight departed at 11am). I decided to call BA and explained my frustration but they couldn\u2019t help accept to say sorry and suggested to ask the Attendant once on board. I did only to be told my friend could take the other middle seat in front of me - they had nothing \u201ctogether\u201d otherwise! I saw a ton of open seats in business too but they wouldn\u2019t let me upgrade. Even when we boarded the plane they seated our section last! Really?! Last?! When my colleague and I finally were allowed to board premium we were pushed aside last minute for another Japanese woman in economy! I got the distinct feeling we were pushed aside because we were foreigners too and that just made me feel sick to my stomach.  Needless to say, vvI will never fly with JAL again. They\u2019re non-service Service, faux smiles, fake polite voices and disgusting food made me sick. I was extremely disappointed with them and will never fly with them ever again! They were the worst!",

Food options, beverages, comfortable seat, entertainment, overall service was outstanding.  The only missing piece is not offering pajamas.  Instead, they offer some jacket to wear during the flight - which is fine, but I\u2019d prefer pajamas.  Asked for extra blanket and got it without any problem.  Temperature was comfortable, and B777 aircraft was relatively quiet, although I was sitting right next to the engine.  Qantas First Lounge at LAX wasn\u2019t crowded and very comfortable.  Overall, excellent flying experience.",

J class is really a premium economy class, bigger/better seats, located at the front of the cabin.  Found out at Haneda airport, from JAL, that there was only a First class lounge, and boarding for J class was last.  Entrance to the plan was from the front, away from the coach boarding area, so it was no bad.  This must be JAL's general boarding plan, just not familiar with it.  Overall experience with jAL was OK, with the great in flight service",

In Business, I was worried about the 2-3-2 configuration on JAL 1/2, But the seats are amazing.  They are fully lie flat and extremely private, roomy on comfortable.  I slept seven hours on the flight from Haneda to SFO earlier this year and on the recent SFO-HND flight, I think I got fully eight hours.  Food is very good.  I ordered the Japanese menu and the quality and variety is delicious.  The Sakura Lounges in Asia are typically top notch.  Sadly, the SFO Lounge in SFO was quite a disappointment, but I have yet to visit a lounge at an American airport that is even 10% as good as a typical lounge at major Asian airports.\n\nAll in all, JAL is a great airline.",

I could fully stretch out my legs and the recline was enough to allow decent sleep to happen. I'm not saying it was bliss in the sky but a huge improvement. Food is the same as economy (which is excellent) with pergaps some extra drink options thrown in. Slippers and fancy headphones thrown in too. A very strong recommendation if you are flying overnight. It will be hard to go back to regular economy",

        "review_text": "I had two flights from JAL, from Gimpo (Korea) to Narita, and Narita to Chicago O'Hare, and I have nothing but good things to say. \n\nin Gimpo, the staff let me know I had an extra bag check in available, and helped me save $60 by dividing the bags under weight and made my trip easier by checking in the second bag I had as a check-in. The boarding process was very quick as well. It was a short 2 hour flight but the plane I was on had big leg room so I could store my long bag under the seat, and got food too for a short flight as well as drinks were offered at various intervals.\n\nIn Narita, I arrived 4 hours early because I wasn't sure how the check-in process when I didn't speak Japanese at all, but the staff was very helpful and let me check in my bag early. The staff helping was also very respectful and courteous when I had questions to ask. Luckily I didn't have a passenger next to me on my flight so I had plenty of arm room but the legroom was spacey for economy flight. Food was delicious, snacks were offered near the back where guests could grab at will and also were handed out (rice crackers and bread), and also got drinks at regular intervals. The back part of the seat was a little bit too stiff for my liking but they do give you a neck pillow you can use for your back as well so it worked out.\n\nOne of the best, if not the best, flight experience I had, with both flights.",

Refills were offered and staff were attentive to passengers needs.  \nImportant little touches included the provision of toothbrush and paste in the toilets prior to landing and the toilets were kept in pristine condition. \nWithout reservation I recommend JAL and would  certainly fly with them again.

The window and centre seats are totally boxed in, hard to squeeze into, and largely devoid of storage space. Japanese meal is very good, western meal so so. The pillows are Japanese style, and if you have not experienced that before, imagine a rock 3 cm thick and you're in the zone. Service is friendly but formulaic. The cabin temperature was set to 26 degrees (hottest I've ever experienced on a plane), and there are no individual air vents. Just to make things slightly comical, instead of giving out pyjamas (go Qantas!) they give out cardigans! Hardly useful as the sweat runs down your forehead!",

The teamwork of Cabin attendants were also flawless, not to be over-present but always there discreetly. As the seat cross the aisle was vacant, cabin attendant prepared the bed there, so that I can switch between work and rest with no hustle and time-loss.

The trip was lovely, but the cabin crew was far superior returning from Japan compared with the crew enroute...which is a shame as I slept a good part of the return journey. Service was attentive without being over the top. I had read blogs of several frequent travelers who touted all the special attention they received. Extra PJs to take home, FAs insisting they try EVERY menu item, etc. I believe they get all these extra services because they are somehow flagged in the reservations system, because I got none of that. However, it was a great flight using miles, but there is no way in heck it was worth anywhere close to $24,000.00 in terms of service or amenities, however, personal space was exceptional!!",

This class of service also allowed us to use the JAL Lounges in DFW and NRT to eat and drink while waiting for flights.  Both flights DFW-NRT and NRT-HKG were on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner with 2 -4-2 seating.  We were on the 2 side and the seats were comfortable with leg rests.  Service was OUTSTANDING, and entertainment system very good.  Our only small negative comment:  the food, as it was geared to the Japanese tastes.  We would have preferred more western options.  However, there were always snacks and we never went hungry.  Will definitely look to book JAL Premium Economy on future trips.",

I flew this because of my One World Emerald Status but never again.  i usually go to JFK and from now on i would rather take AA to a gateway and change planes instead of taking the JAL nonstop.\n\nYou walk onto the plane and it is like walking into a dingy and beat-up rabbit warren.  Cabins haven't been updated in years.\n\nThe Sky Suites on the 777 (and the 787) are claustrophobic at best.  Window seats are cramped, aisle seats are basically on the aisle and offer no privacy and if you are in a middle seat good luck!\n\nFood is good but the meal service itself was horrible - on this flight, the meal service took just short of 3 hours from the time we took off until the time that the service ended- and i was in the first row!  there were over 30M waits between courses.  i have experienced this type of service on previous flights.\n\nOne of the issues was that menus were not offered and orders not taken until about 30 minutes after take off - not like other airlines where this is done before takeoff.\n\nThere are only 2 TINY lavs for 42 pax - not nearly enough.\n\nAmenities are geared towards smaller people - there is one size of flight cardigan -it's a medium.  Slippers also were undersized - i wear a 10 1/2 shoe (not that big) and the slippers were too small.  it was a problem as you needed them when you went into the lav!!\n\ni can't see how they can continue this level of service when competing with ANA",

I have slept much better on other airlines. Spending over 40 hours in flight to and from JFK meant that most of the decent screen entertainment had been exhausted before arrival back in Sydney.\n\nThe food, especially out of Narita, was quite ordinary. JAL is using \"young innovative chefs\" to create new dishes. (Just what is \"burdock\" anyway?) At least the delicious Japanese beer was free-flowing.",

We have visited Japan 5 times on different airlines but have to say Air Canada wins for the best service.  Both the departing and returning JAL flights were delayed, by 2+ and 1+ hours respectively.  \nJAL's service on the plane was fine, but the menu leaves something to be desired for the North American palate.  The food was well presented, enough to eat for most women, but very Japanese cuisine, with no Western food alternatives offered.  They have a good selection of movies.  The plane was fairly late model with tinted windows rather than pull down shades and there was the average seat leg and elbow space.  The staff was friendly and accommodating, but the Japanese female flight attendants speak very meekly and quietly so we could not understand any of their instructions over the plane intercom.  On the flight to Japan we sat in the boarding area 45 minutes because they announced that the plane was \"not ready\".  Then we boarded and sat on the tarmac in the plane for over an hour.  Because we departed so late, the air controllers had to re-schedule us into another flight slot.  On arriving in Japan we descended and were a few hundred feet from touchdown when the pilots thrust the engines and we climbed steeply back into the sky and flew back out over the ocean for another 20 minutes.  We were dismayed that a 10 hour flight became closer to 13 hours.  Anyone can have an off day, so were not expecting similar delays on our return flight.  The pilot then did speed up I suppose because even leaving an hour late, he got us back on schedule.  However we have never encountered these problems when flying Air Canada, our usual airline.  The flight prices were also almost a third more expensive than AC, even though we booked 7 months in advance.  However this could be because it was Christmas season travel.",

All other rows had plent of leg room too but if the person next to you \"reclined\" you would probably have difficulty getting past them. I say \"recline\" but in fact the seats move/slide forward rather than recline backwards so you do intrude on the space behind which I believe is a great way to go.\nYou get a small pack of stuff and basic noise cancelling headphones. The only let down for me was that the meal options were the same as economy so they were average choices. there were a couple of special alcoholic beverages in PE that were over what you could get in economy. The in flight service was very good. Overall believe that JAL PE is one of the best I have flown for the extra $.",

I've never seen that done on a flight.  They keep coming at you to ask if you need anything else.  They keep the toilets immaculate.  JAL is an excellent airline/choice.  The Dreamliner pressurizes the cabin more like sea level (1 atmosphere) so you don't get the ear popping and you feel more relaxed after the flight.  Each seat has its own in-flight entertainment screen/suite.",

She could not change my seat to be seated with hubby but she put a note in the system that I have motion sickness and would prefer to sit next to hubby. I was advised to check in early.\n\nAt the airport, the staff did arrange  for me to sit beside hubby.\n\nOn both legs of the flight, a specific flight crew was designated to look after me. They would introduce themselves and check on me once in a while. Transiting at Narita, I exited the plane to find a ground staff holding a paper with my name and asking if I was ok. So much attention levied but not at all intrusive.First class service on board. \n\nIf not for the hassle about not being able to choose seats for N class tickets, I would have chosen JAL anytime.",

Interference-free boarding and de-planing. A flight as smooth as the atmospheric conditions allow.\n\nWhich is more than I can say about the airport experience at Haneda.

        "review_text": "JAL operated this 10:40 am flight from Hong Kong to Narita with a B787 Dreamliner equipped with the Sky Suite II in business class.  Prior to boarding, I used the Cathay Wing First Class lounge instead of the Qantas business class lounge that is the JAL designated lounge.  Nothing wrong with the Qantas lounge as I have used it before but wanted to try the Wing for breakfast to compare.  There was a buffet with standard Western breakfast items as well as Chinese items such as dim sum and congee.  In addition, there was an a la carte menu with Western and Chinese items.  I ordered the glutinous rice chicken which was OK but served in an odd manner with the lotus leaves covering cut open in a rectangular opening on top which made it difficult to get to the food at the edges.  Service in the lounge was generally good and there was no wait for a table.  \n\nBoarding at the gate was efficient with different frequent flyer groups separated for priority boarding so that JAL Diamond/One World Emerald members boarded first from a separate line, right after those needing assistance. \n\nThe Sky Suite II is a fully flat seat but when fully reclined, it sinks very low to the ground and the space is very narrow so that lying on one's back, there is not much room for broader shoulders or much movement.  Nevertheless, I did manage some good sleep in the flat bed after meal service.   \n\nThere is a tray table under the video screen which when pulled out, can be flipped open to a decent sized table.  There is also a slot under the screen that can fit electronics with an outlet nearby to charge up your phone or other electronic.  A new addition is a contoured foam cushion (pictured) which is quite comfortable as a seat back but less useful as a pillow.  As always, service and food on JAL was excellent. \n\nA good short haul flight with a very comfortable seat and great food and service.",

It is usually recommended to buy the air ticket directly from the airline and I had a great experience with other AA, United, Delta website before. \n\nHowever, with Japan Airline, the website keeps showing tickets that are not available for booking or the seats are not available. You keep seeing the ticket, select it, fill in the passengers information and then, the website will pop the window say \" It could not find the fare you selected\". They should let the website hold the ticket the moment passenger choose the ticket, and give time to fill info and pay (say 15mins). \n\nThe funny part is when I am on phone with a customer agent (for JL in USA- 1-800-525-3663). The agent is seeing the ticket in their system (9 seats left at the price for that flight). At the same time, I am trying to buy that ticket at the same time on my computer when she is on the other side of the phone, the same error popped up and would not allow me to book that ticket. \n\nJapan airline really needs to fix and integrate their website better with their ticket system. \n\nCustomer service is generally great inflight and through phone (if you can wait 30mins-1hr).",

It's very reliable, and these are sociable hours. JAL uses the Qantas Business and First lounges which are more than adequate and serve a decent breakfast beforehand.  I traveled with family including a toddler.\nBoarding is efficient with Business and First having their own boarding line at the gate.  Business passengers have SkySuites which regularly win awards.  The configuration is 2-2-2 but there's the added advantage of all window seat passengers having their own convenient entry \"hallway\".  \nI do have a gripe.  After they turn the seatbelt signs off, they start the lunch service which in my opinion, is far too early.  By the time they serve drinks, hand out menus and take orders, lunch is served around 10.30am.  I'm convinced that it's to fit in with the staffs' break schedule because, after this, many of them disappear.  My second gripe is that over the years, they've hardly changed the menu.  There are 2 choices, - Western or Japanese.  Western is always appetisers followed by either \"Western beef\" or some sort of fish dish.  Japanese is a selection of appetizers, then a Japanese specialty.  Whilst it is very well presented and in some cases colorful, the format never changes.  The children's meals were very unappealing and were left untouched.   There's a variety of snacks which they say, can be served \"any time\".  The service is gracious and respectful and in all instances, every effort is made to help. The standard of English varies from very good to adequate.  \nThe beds are flat and you are supplied with a mattress and a thin quilt.  The pillows are a bit inadequate however it's possible to get some reasonable sleep.\nThe passenger/restroom ratio is positive and there's rarely a need to wait.  They're always spotless.\nI always feel very safe on this flight and they're a stickler for keeping to the schedule.  Their business class fares are more than competitive when compared to other airlines. \nI find them hard to beat, all things considered.  It connects well with onward flights to Europe and the US but also arrives at the perfect time for a hotel stopover at Narita which I prefer to do.  \nHowever, their attention to children is very poor.  There are no coloring books or amusements offered although there are some childrens movies. \nApart from this, the schedule, safety procedures and value are good.",

This might have been our most impressive flight in all of our travels from the states (includes Europe, Australia, and New Zealand all in business class). \n\nFirst the staff was impeccable. They were attentive, friendly, and regularly checked if we needed anything. I realize we were in business class but from what I could tell the entire cabin was treated just as well. \n\nThe seats were plush and had a lot of space. My only reservation is the fact that the chair does not lay completely flat. Not that you couldn\u2019t completely stretch out but I am weird and can\u2019t sleep well at a slightly angled position. It feels as if I am sliding down. The tv screens were easy to navigate and the selection of movies (new and blockbuster) was perfect. If you decide to bring your own headphones make sure you have a double jack. \n\nMy one negative of the flight are the windows. I like that you can greatly dim them into a deep blue to block the sun, but we were on the side where the sun was directly hitting the window and even with the dim selection we were blinded while laying back. There should still be an option to black them completely out with a shade. \n\nFinally the food was fantastic. An American and Japanese selection was available (my palette was not advanced enough to try the eel or squid, but the soups were amazing). \n\nI highly recommend this airline.",

        "review_text": "We can't speak highly enough about JAL generally, and their business class in particular.  From the moment we checked in at Sydney airport till we walked out of the airport in Narita we had an amazing time and a lovely experience.  The flight attendants were typically gentle, beautiful Japanese ladies (yes only ladies in our section) who smiled and made us feel that nothing was too much trouble. Quite different from some other airlines (who will remain nameless) where the attendants give the unmistakable impression that they really are above serving the lowly public and that they really don't want to be here.  Not so with JAL attendants.\n\nThe seats themselves were brilliant.  Full lay back seats in their own quite substantial pods, so much better than business class seating on some other airlines where the seats are just much bigger and more space.  This we felt was more like a 1st class experience (although we haven't traveled 1st class, we can only imagine).  We chose the Japanese menu and it was excellent food, set out on a little table cloth with white linen, sometimes a bento box and sometimes plated food. Complimentary French champagne was offered frequently along with glass refills, plus other drinks of course.  \n\nThe screen was very large and down the end of the pod so the whole experience was perfect, sitting with legs stretched right out, watching the screen, eating lovely Japanese food and drinking French Champagne.  Ahh bliss. Shame it is only a 9.5 hour trip.\n\nThe toilets were clean and immaculate right to the end of the flight.  Fresh flowers in the cubicles were a nice touch.\n\nWe had heard that JAL is one of the best and we can 100% agree and say that it was the best flight experience we have ever had - the icing on the cake for 2 glorious weeks in beautiful Japan.  (Can you tell we are fans of Japan?)",

When we did try, we were not allowed to change seats for the first leg of the flight. After calling the customer service line, the staff could not help either.  She was polite and apologetic. She would put a note in the system to indicate we would like to be seated together. She advised us to go to airport 3 hrs before departure at get it done.\n\nWe did arrive at airport 5 plus in the morning. The check-in counter staff said she could not change and we would have to wait till another passenger check in, upon which the staff would ask if he is agreeable. We were told to find out at the departure gate.\nSince it is such a long flight, we were a bit anxious not to know till boarding. Thankfully, a passenger agreed to change seats.\nThe flight experience was good.\n\nWe now have to call again to request for seat change before our return flight. I hope we won't have to do the same all over again.\n\nIn short, the system was bad but the staff helped to make the experience a little easier to swallow.",

Food is culture and if you claim you are an airline that respects other cultures, the food choices and flavors should be taken care of. Despite JL has been flying to and from India since many decades, their food was bland, not filling and not satisfactory. \n\nI gave feedback and a senior member of the crew was professional and kind enough to come and listen to me, apologize and offer me a basket of snacks. It helped a bit but the flavors were light years away from any Indian palate. \n\nOver 10 hours flight without yummy food is pretty much a torturer but rest of the experience -  On-time performance, check-in, landing, luggage service etc. was great.",

I had just gotten off of the JAL SIN-NRT flight and the 777's business class was a 1-2-1 layout that featured weird seats in the center where the legs of the two center seat passengers overlap, but at different heights, making one person uncomfortably low and the other uncomfortably high, cramped, and claustrophobic. So, on the NRT-SAN flight, I was looking forward to try something different--and found the seats to be quite comfortable for sleeping.\n\nSeated in the back row of the biz cabin was not a problem, until mealtime, when they ran out of entrees that my seat mate and I had ordered. I pushed back, at business class prices, I expected to at least get the meal I wanted. (They made someone else change their mind, which I felt bad about, but why did they target us for the forced change?)\n\nThe amenity kit was a bit lackluster, but in general they are a waste, so I didn't mind.\n\nI wouldn't seek out JAL for business class travel. Their product is not at the same level as Cathay Pacific, or Singapore Airlines. But the cabin crew were attentive when you needed something and quick to pickup finished trays.",

Business Class was not filled to capacity, so if you've chosen the wrong seat, you should be able to change.

Snacks were rice crackers in a typical snack bag, on previous flights our snacks are on plates.  The group lounge in Vancouver is horrible, the food was awful and the only drinks they offered were beer.  We ended up eating before our flight.  The service on the flight was ok, the flight attendants seemed irritated that we didn't understand the menu options.  The food was awful, not one decent thing to eat.  We tried their Japanese menu, awful and then their western menu, awful!  \n\nOn the way to Narita the baggage handler destroyed my daughters luggage, they let us know our luggage would be bagged in plastic on arrival to Japan.  We had to find the JAL damaged luggage and even though this was inconvenient they were fantastic about replacing which is why I gave them 3 stars.  \n\nWhenever we fly long distance we fly business and this is by far the worst business class we have ever had.  The seats do not lay down like a bed, the feet actually go under the seat in front very low so if you have swelling issues like I do you have to sit up the entire time so your feet aren't at floor level.",

We were all pleasantly surprised. I am 6ft tall and thought the legroom more than adequate. The food was non-frills but good enough for my picky family. The snack of a Hagen Das cup of ice cream was a real treat. The attendants were all very friendly and eager to help. Boarding and exiting was straight forward and the entertainment system had all of us occupied as expected.  The only drawback for me was the seat itself. For long hauls like this, I would have liked something a bit more comfortable. I am not talking about the size but shape and or the cushioning. Passengers are expected to be in their seats for extended periods of time and this seat left me sore by the time we landed.",

You can carry on two bags and check two bags for free. In other wrds, once you pay for your ticket they don't nickel and dime you. Another great thing i thoe majority of the customers are Japanese so the flight is quiet- no drama- and everyone is polite- how wonderful on a very long flight. I love JAL.",

        "review_text": "I booked this flight using Alaska Airline miles and initially booked a business class seat but a week later I was able to locate availability for first class seats. Checkin at JFK Terminal 1 was a breeze and it took maybe 2-3 minutes in the dedicated First class line. Since JAL does not participate in TSA PreCheck we used the standard TSA line and that process took way longer than it needed to because TSA doesn't know how to get their act together. Luckily for us JAL added the Lufthansa Senator lounge at JFK as of January so we were lucky to get to use this lounge instead of the Air France one (still available and you can switch between both). The lounge was nice and the views of the runway were great for making the time pass by. We left the lounge 15 minutes before boarding and had no problem boarding with the priority section of travelers. The JAL first class cabin is really nice and with only 8 suites it feels both spacious and private. Everyone we interacted with during our 14+ hour flight was super friendly and I greatly enjoyed myself. The food was incredible and I would recommend that you try the Japanese menu as everything was so yummy. My single complain about this flight was the temperature at which the cabin was kept. I tried falling asleep but couldn't very well because the cabin felt so hot for the entire flight.\n\nThe seat is very spacious and when you're ready to sleep a mattress pad and pjs are provided along with a heavier blanket (you are unlikely to need it since it's so hot on the plane). \n\nOverall I look forward to earning more Alaska miles to redeem them for another chance to fly on JAL first.",

        "review_text": "We have flown with JAL many times. The service has always been stellar. The employees on the ground and in the air have always been wonderful. However, this trip was HORRIBLE and unscrupulous. We connected in Chicago and were on our way to Narita International Airport in Tokyo. Once we would land, we knew we had a 2 hour and 15 minute layover. Surely that would be enough to land, taxi to the gate, deplane, go through immigration, get to the next terminal for departure, go through security, and check in to the departure gate. When we landed, a JAL employee met us at the airplane door and asked if we were going to Fukuoka? We said yes and she said simply, \"late\". We didn't know what she meant. Upon arriving at the JAL connecting gate for Fukuoka, we were told that the flight had already departed. We were 30 minutes EARLY, but for some unexplained reason, they said we were late. Since we were totally exhausted from the 13 hour flight, we were in shock. We started asking why, what to do, where to get info for next flight, why our flight had departed early...etc. We were shocked that few people spoke fluent English. Over the next 45 minutes to an hour, we were sent from place to place within the airport. Finally, I almost fainted from overheating and exhaustion. My wife was standing in yet another JAL line trying to get information. The line was extremely long. I shouted to her that I needed to get somewhere to lay down or I would faint. JAL was of no help whatsoever. No one inside Narita could speak English well enough to see that we were in extreme distress. Nor could they direct us to help. We ended up taking a chance and boarding a bus that was for the Crown Plaza Hotel. The police did not help us, the taxi drivers were useless. Only this bus driver would help. We were taken to this hotel where we told the manager of our problems and they accommodated us with superb compassion. We called the ANA airlines and made new reservations to continue to our final destination. Two days later, at our new hotel, we called our booking agent, American Express, to tell her of our plight. They called JAL to reconfirm our original plans and tickets. JAL told AMEX that, since we did not report our missed flight connection to the right party, our tickets home were INVALIDATED!!!!!!!!!!! Further, to get home, JAL wanted us to pay $15,000.00 for one way tickets back to the US. In other words, our $12,000 tickets which we had paid for 6 months prior, were now invalid, and it would cost us $15,000.00 more to get home. They told us this at 2:30 am!!!!! We were totally incensed and outraged. We argued for two hours with JAL, who refused to change their position. They said it was our fault!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. My wife was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. I was about to have my fourth heart attack.  Our AMEX representative decided to get the JAL rep to get her supervisor on the phone. Our AMEX rep told us she would handle it and would call us back. Two hours passed and at 4:30 am she called us back. She was able to get our tickets re-validated and get us back on track. CAN you imagine how infuriated we were with JAL. They would have left us stranded in Japan unless we paid them an additional $15,000. They told us to read the fine print on our contracts. We will NEVER use them again. We will never use them for our company business trips again either. What a disgrace to do business in such a fashion. We are consulting our attorneys",

        "review_text": "I flew on JL domestic economy from HND to ITA in February 2018.  HND is the main domestic airport in Tokyo and it's a lot closer than NRT from downtown Tokyo.  Shuttle bus and train options are available from downtown.  Or you may take taxi (less than $100/one way from the most of the hotels in downtown).  \n\nAt HND airport, JL has a separate security line for Elite members and my Emerald status qualified for it.  Almost no one in the line and it was very quick to go through the security.  Used JL domestic business lounge prior to boarding.  Food/drink options for early in the morning (7 am) were limited.  So if you plan to have breakfast in the lounge, you may want to consider a plan B.  Coffee was very good, and many power outlets for laptop (be sure to bring Japanese power outlet adopter).  \n\nFlight was short (about one hour) and comfortable on B777.  JL offers a discounted fare, if you buy at least a few days prior to departure.  On board free wifi was also available to keep working for the duration, or to upload to SNS, if you'd like.  \n\nDeparture/arrival were both on time.  Check in at Kiosk, boarding at gate were both smooth.  CA offered blankets before departure.  A few beverage options in flight, despite the short flight duration.  Overall, a great experience.",

The flight is around six hours so it\u2019s not overly long, but it was a red eye flight so it\u2019s never easy trying to sleep, but not long enough to be uncomfortable for too long. The seats were comfortable and I found adequate leg room. The inflight service was modern and up to date so it was easy to use and the content was good. The food was light and simple and surprisingly tasty, consisting of a starter, some noodles and a yoghurt. Overall I had a pleasant flight, although it wasn\u2019t of the highest quality it was adequate and reasonably priced so in my opinion, value for money.",

I love that the flight attendants cared about my food restrictions. They gave me a ticket for each meal and asked questions, they never made me feel bad for having medical food restrictions. I love that I got a pillow, a blanket (even in economy), they had good films selection, and I listened to U2 and other music through both of the 12-14 hour flights. \nThis was the best economy (which is the only class of ticket I can afford) I have ever been on, I was treated and respected unlike certain airlines here in the US where I have felt and been treated like cattle.  wish I could take Japan Airlines again, I know they are in the Oneworld alliance.",

Due to the fog in the morning, my flight from SEA got cancelled, and AS rerouted us to OAK, then shuttled in to SFO.  It's a good thing that I had over four hours to make the connection.  I only had about 45 minutes before boarding JL001 at SFO.  \n\nThe aircraft was B777.  As always, seat was comfortable, TV screen was large, headphone sounded clear, amenities were good,  JL provided really thick mattress that made sleeping even more comfortable.  I got extra blanket without any issue. \nJL supplied a light jacket to wear during the flight, instead of pajamas - that was no problem as I dressed casual/comfortable for the flight.  .Meal was very tasty and I was able to eat whenever I wanted up to 1.5 hours before arrival.  Overall, IMHO,  one of the best business classes.",

There\u2019s 4 of us so that means we\u2019re allowed 8 suitcases of 23kilos each. We only had 3 luggage but 1 was 26kilos. Others were 13k and 17k. Even when we\u2019re way under the limit they made us move the items around the luggage to make the 23kilos on the heavier one. It\u2019s a hassle when your in the check in counter and opening your luggage in the open. \n\nSecondly, the flight we had has a special RED menu which means \u201cyour only choice or starve\u201d It\u2019s a dinner flight and just over 4 hours so yeah food is good. Unfortunately, the shrimp curry main dish, jello like dessert, spicy potato salad just didn\u2019t blend right. The butter pecan BR ice cream helped but not as much. The flight going to Narita had excellent food and taste. Hopefully not all RED menus will be like this.",

(Compared to other Asian airlines Premium Economy seats, which for the most part have a seat pitch of 38 inches) \nThose few extra inches  JAL provide, make a big difference when it comes to stretching out and sleeping. \nJAL's Premium Economy class passengers have a separate cabin as well. \n\nHowever, unlike other airlines which have the same class of travel, JAL do not allow their Premium Economy passengers the use of their lounges anywhere, not even at a cost! That, I would say was the only disappointment in my journey. As I had been told whilst checking in at Melbourne, that I would have use of their lounge in Tokyo whilst in transit. That does help on long haul flights when one has a few hours to wait for the next flight.\n\nHowever, it was the service of the staff on board all my JAL flights who went out of their way to make a very long flight as comfortable as possible!!",

I was about to start my second trip to Japan this year, when the fourth Nor'easter of March landed, and JAL sent an email 20 hours before the flight telling us our flight was canceled giving us a phone number to call.  After more than three hours being on hold with no answer, we try calling with different phones, four of them, and always on hold until 9pm Eastern time when they closed their office in California leaving us without an answer.  Calling directly the Japanese office, they weren't much help either, at least they answered the phone, and all that was offered was a two stops flight (more than 30 hours) next Tuesday. All other airlines flying the same plane re-booked their passengers, JAL got us grounded and being unable to have the dreamed vacation and the impossibility to cancel hotels before they became nonrefundable. Wonderful airline when everything goes as it should be, but if there are cancellation due to bad weather or any other problem, good luck! We are still waiting for a notice of refund when hotels.com already credited our credit card for the hotels we were able to cancel.",

Seat was an inch or two away from the Premium Economy offering of another airline and the entertainment center was very complete for coach.  Service was impeccable and food selection was great. Beverage service was consistent from pre meal alcohol to post meal coffee or ocha. Definitely worth the extra coin.",

        "review_text": "The title of this review is something of a serious question: would it be possible just to live on a Japan Airlines (JAL) flight? I can say very definitively that I thoroughly enjoyed my 11 hour flight from JFK to Narita and the subsequent 7 hour flight from Narita to Changi in Singapore. I was actually looking forward to the return flights! And I was in economy!\n\nThe flight attendants were the most attentive and courteous I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. Its silly of me to have liked this so much, but it was also completely thrilling that they all bowed to the travellers at the start of the flight.\n\nYou are almost constantly offered food and drink, and really good food and drink! The main/dinner meals I was offered were tasty, nutritious, and filling. Snacks and drinks came at perfect intervals and if you feel peckish in between meals and snacks, there's an area where you can pick up a snack on your own. \n\nFor me the seats were very comfortable and the entertainment offerings varied (for example, there's digital manga available) and satisfying. \n\nIt does help if you understand a little Japanese, but almost all flight attendants know some English. \n\nBecause I generally travel budget airlines, I'm pretty happy if I get offered a pillow and blanket at no cost (which JAL did as well). When I've travelled on non-budget flights, I've always been made aware that I was travelling in economy, but not with JAL. The excellent treatment JAL offered was above and beyond what I have ever experienced on any flight and I look forward to travelling with them again!",

For breakfast, I had the cheese and ham omelette, which also came with a selection of little side dishes. Because our return flight was at night, instead of serving dinner on the flight, we were granted access to the JAL sky lounge where we were able to eat from the buffet before boarding. I'm guessing this was to allow passengers to try and sleep undisturbed for as long as possible.\n\nThe cabin crew were terrific, at one point I felt slightly travel sick and the air hostess attending me made sure I was as comfortable as possible and checked in on me to see how I was doing.",

From the brand new 787-900 , to the sky suite III seat with extra width and pitch , the screen , the food , the service....Just perfect . \n\nThere is just 1 design error i spotted , that is the switch for the  reading light and service call is on the LED screen itself . Very often , passengers will accidentally press it . It happens very often in the flight . \n\nand 1 more thing is , the temperature in the plane is a little warm and i am just wearing summer shirt .  There is no individual vent for each seat . \n\nother then these 2 design flaws , its just perfect . Singaopre airlines now has a very strong competitor .",

The aircraft leaves after lunch, and arrives in Tokyo late afternoon for a early evening connection to Sydney. This allowed me to stay awake until the overnight flight to Sydney, so I arrived early morning after a good sleep. Made the jet lag almost none existent. The aircraft are both 787s, although the Canada sectors looked like an older interior, with shell seats, compared to the Sydney sectors which were enclosed. I must say though the enclosed seats felt somewhat cosier than the flat shell seats from Vancouver. JAL service was very good, nothing was too much trouble, and the meal selections were great. I also like the service starting not too long after take off, as it allows you to get the meals out of the way in case you need to work. My only issue the the repeated announcements after take off, they can be annoying when you have just started a movie.",

Well, that\u2019s how the JAL local ground crew did their obligatory bow-and-greet as they opened the check-in counters, self-conscioulsy. But that was the only self-conscious episode during the whole JAL flight from Manila to JFK, because everything else was done smoothly and efficiently and with an eye to real passenger service. The check-in counters readily accomodated my request for an aisle seat (their online check-in was not working that day) and even gave us the seat with the biggest legroom at no cost. I could only guess that maybe the long life expectancy common to Japanese made their society more caring to their elderly and attentive to their needs. \nThe English language skills of the cabin crew are passable and one can request and get the usual amenities for a long flight. Of course, the Filipino cabin crews in PAL can engage in better small talk and can even give you tips on getting around Metro Manila with their greater English proficiency, but I digress..\nWhat was a pleasant surprise to us, however, was the quality of the food. Although I readily confess, they had me at Haagen Dazs ice cream, standard dessert even in economy, the appetizer and the mains were no slouch either. They were tasty, or as foodie blogs always say; the flavors of their offerings are like a party in the palate. I finished everything. Maybe I am really just a man of simple tastes that a simple serving of Haagen Dazs vanilla ice cream was enough to leave me wondering: if this is just Economy Class, I wonder what First Class has on offer!\nThe layover was five hours in Narita airport, more than enough time to walk around the shops and have a snack or a drink at the good restaurants all over. Souvenir shops include wine stores selling the now trending Japanese single-malts and candy stores selling Kit Kats in various flavors found only in Japan.\nBy and large, flying with JAL was a thoroughly pleasant experience. And it starts with that self-conscious bow by the non-Japanese check-in staff.",

The professionalism of the staff during this time meant that nobody had any issue taking it all completely in their stride.\n\nPart-way through the flight, the head of the cabin crew went to literally every single one of the hundreds of passengers on the flight and, with a gracious smile, offered her personal and sincere apology again in both English and Japanese, and asked if there was anything they could do to make the flight more comfortable. Truly above and beyond.\n\nThe food was also excellent. I had never tried Tokyo Soup Stock before, but I wish I had while I was still in Japan. This soup was served in-flight and it blew my mind, shattering my preconceptions about what is possible in airline food.\n\nI will absolutely fly JAL when I return to Japan.

        "review_text": "In early March 2018 I took my first flight on the relatively new JAL 787-8 Dreamliner from Melbourne to Tokyo.\n\nBoarding was on time and well organised. The plane was in good order and service was excellent.\n\nFood quality seemed reasonably good, although I didn't eat much as it was a very early morning flight (just after midnight).\n\nThe shell style seats in premium economy are good but not great. Leg room appears excellent but there was two problems. First, I was in seat 20C (aisle) and a support from the seat in front divides the leg/foot space in front of you. There doesn't seem to be any reason why the support could not have been moved to the edge of the seat in front but, then again, I'm not an aircraft engineer! I noted that the above was the case in all \"C\" and \"H\" seats (other than the bulkhead row 17).\n\nSecond, the seat bottom moves forward and the back slides down when you \"recline\" the seat. This takes up some of the otherwise generous legroom and seemed a less comfortable position than the usual recline back mode of aircraft seats.\n\nOn my return flight on the 787-9 to Sydney from Tokyo, I was in the bulkhead row (seat 17K). The legroom here is certainly impressive. I was able to prop my feet on my cabin bag that I placed against the bulkhead (after take-off of course) and get into a good position for a sleep.\n\nOne last thing was that the toilet just behind PE on the \"AC\" side of the cabin was especially large; a good spot to change into sleepwear if that is what you do on long overnight flights.\n\nOverall, good value for money (@$2000 return) on a top class airline.",

I say hard because we were on a code share flight, and the ball kept being passed back and forth between airlines. LESSON LEARNED... The meal choice lies with the ticketed airline, regardless of who flies the plane!!\nWith attentive flight attendants, who bow each time they encounter you, to the airport ramp staff who wave as a group when you push back....you can't get mad at them!\nOur Premium Economy gave us a small private plane section, and a feeling we were somewhat special over the masses in Economy. Our recliner seat with footrest, deferred any guilt we might have by hampering the passenger behind.\nWould we fly them again? As long as the price is not crazy...yes!",

        "type_of_route": "Asia",
        "review_text": "I flew from Haneda to Hong Kong on Japan Airlines top level business class suite - Sky Suite III - on a B777-200.  Sky Suites have direct aisle access from every seat and in the Sky Suite III iteration, seats are angled out towards the window on the sides and in the center section, the two seats are angled away from each other - the same configuration as Cathay Pacific uses on its long haul business class.  The seat has a flat platform at the far end of the seat that forms the foot of the bed when the seat is reclined to a fully flat bed and below that platform is an angled foot rest that is used when the seat is reclined as an angled seat rather than as a fully flat bed.  The seat has a good size video screen and flip down table that swings out toward the passenger.  There is also storage under the armrest but it cannot be used on take-off or landing when the armrest must be pushed down to be flushed with the seat.  The recline is a bit awkward as there are not pre-sets that can quickly recline to several seat positions such as upright for eating, slight recline for watching entertainment and z-position for resting other than sleeping on a fully flat bed.  Instead you have to press the recline button which then reclines that whole seat in a pre-set path (ie you cannot separately operate the seat back and leg portion of the seat).  For a short haul flight from Haneda to Hong Kong, this was not an issue and the seat is very comfortable for such a flight.  For a longer haul flight, the lack of options might be more bothersome.  To be fair though, the fully flat seat offering is much superior to competitors such as Cathay Pacific which offers only regular slightly wider reclining seats for business class on the route.\n\nEntertainment movies selection was good.  Wifi is available on the flight.  Lunch was a choice between Japanese and a couple of Western choices and as usual for Japan Airlines, was very good.  I had the Japanese meal with a starter box of a half dozen or so different appetizers, and then two hot items with rice.  I also tried one of two sakes on offer and it turned out to be a small full glass bottle served chill and was good.  Dessert was Hagen Daz ice cream.  JAL serves a special coffee in business class which is only available on board and I always order it because it is very good, strong and smooth with low acidity just the way I like it.  Service as always is superb.  The toilets are always clean because the flight attendants never stop going in to clean them.  \n\nPrior to the flight, I used the JAL First Class lounge at Haneda airport and had breakfast.  There was a good selection of food, though less variety than at lunch or dinner that I tried when in the lounge for other flights. There was a chef on duty who made galettes - crepes folded around melted cheese and ham - to order and he was very popular with the guests in the lounge with a constant line of customers for his services.  An oddity of the lounge is that the wifi seems to be confined to certain areas whereas other areas do not seem to have wifi coverage and may be intended as quiet areas.",

The inflight entertainment is not the best in terms of selection, but the system works well. One major ciriticsm is that the food on this overnight flight was pretty bad (a lot worse than normal). Be prepared that you're not going to get much food at all because the airline works on the premise that people will sleep - which is not that easy in Economy class! So after take-off all you get is a tiny snack, and the next meal is a really bad breakfast before arrival. To be fair, the meals on the daytime return flight were better. Also, you're not given an amenities kit, which is fine as long as you are prepared and bring your own. There were some toothbrushes (in limited supply) in the toiltet though. If service, reliability and a comfy seat are your priority, then Japan Airlines is certainly a great choice.",

        "review_text": "I usually fly ANA or SQ for my TPAC flights out of LAX, but I decided to try JAL out after hearing positive reviews. Shortly after booking, I realized I made a terrible mistake. Unlike the other airlines I usually fly, JAL did not allow me to select my seats in advance, not even for an additional fee. I was forced to wait until check in, 24 hours before the flight. This is definitely not ideal for 10-14 hour long flights. Further compounding that, they do not even have a function English language app (their 'app' just contains hyperlinks to the website). This makes checking in while traveling very difficult, especially when you cannot get to a computer 24 hours before your flight. I -was able to get an aisle seat at check-in, but I do not care for suspense and drama when it comes to travel.\n\nAnother issue I had was regarding their baggage policy. My return flight from SIN to LAX was booked as a single leg, but it contained layovers in HND and KIX. The ground staff at SIN tagged my bags through to LAX, informing me that I would only need to collect them once at HND to clear customs, since the following flight was a domestic flight. I was supposed to be able to recheck them at HND to LAX. Unfortunately, after being ran around three different areas in two different terminals by the JAL ground staff at HND, they insisted on ripping off the HND-KIX-LAX tag and insisted on making me retrieve my bag at KIX. Since my flight was late at night, I did not have the option to recheck the bag or leave at lost luggage for my morning flight to LAX.\n\nThe actual service on the airplane was fine. The food was OK and the entertainment options were acceptable. The service was slightly better than NA or EU airlines offer, but not on par with their Asian rivals. The older planes had decent room in economy, but the newer planes were as cramped as any other airline.\n\nAll the hassle and stress from the trip will ensure that I will return to ANA and SQ for my annual TPAC needs moving forward.",

Our flight to Tokyo (connecting city to Bangkok) left with an initial 3 hour delay. This was ok as they contacted us and forewarned although this put our Tokyo connection in jeopardy. We arrived in Tokyo with enough time to make our connection as everything was delayed due to a snow storm (this is where things began to go South, btw it was a total of 3\"). We boarded the plane and then sat onboard 2 Hours while it was de-iced 2x. At the 2 Hour mark we were informed that all flights were cancelled and the airport was closing. We were not allowed to disembark for another 5 Hours, approx. 1-2 a.m.  I realize an airline is not responsible for weather but this is when JAL really failed. Upon disembarking we were given a sheet of paper with phone numbers to rebook ourselves in the morning. We along with thousands of others slept on the floor (not JAL issue) . However in the morning we all discovered the phone numbers given did not work, more so when JAL opened their ticketing windows they flatly refused to service anyone on a cancelled flight and informed us that they were taking care of the passengers booked for that day first. They would not help anyone (hundreds of people) . They realized the self rebooking numbers weren't working and still would not assist. We were informed that Perhaps that evening or the next day they would be able to assist cancelled passengers. In the end we booked a flight with Thai Airways for latter morning to Bangkok, at a cost of $1500+ for a one way from Tokyo to Bangkok.  Needless to say I will NEVER fly JAL again and will urge anyone who hears of our nightmare to do the same.",

For the rest of our trip we used the ANA tourist travel pass (highly recommended 10,800 JPY per sector - JAL also do a tourist pass but they don't fly the Ishigaki leg we required) but there were no travel pass tickets on the date we required on JAL or ANA. I remembered that you can redeem avios on JAL and there were reward flights available for the bargain 4,500 avios and \u00a32 tax. Yes you read that right \u00a32 tax. You can check reward availability on the BA website when logged in to your executive club account. We couldn't check in online as it was a reward booking, and there was a moment of anxiety at check-in when the agent was concerned that 'Miss' as a prefix in Japan means 'child' and this was not a valid adult ticket, but this was resolved - largely to our ignorance as we don't speak Japanese. The 777-200 had 10 seats across and was full. There is a camera on the inflight screens so you can watch take-off and landing live from the nose. Using avios made our itinerary and our budget possible.",

When we reached Tokyo, Japan, there was a snow that covered about less than 5 inches.  Both the airport and the airline did not know what to do, and decided to cancel out more than 30 flight include the one I was on.  I had to seat inside the plane from 6:00 PM to 3:30 AM.  Next morning, there were more than 3000 people stranded at the airport, and the JAL did not provide any information, any rebooking information, and any accommodations to those 3000 people.  Lots of them missed meetings, family emergency, business meetings, and even charity groups missed charity works.  I was willing to purchase another ticket, but unfortunately, it was on Saturday and no tickets available.  All other airlines also ran into same situation.  There was not much communication between customers and the airline counters either.  We were literally begging for information, communication, and tried to get on another flight by standing by options.  It was a nightmare and was not a good experience at all.",

But oddly, business boards in the last zone with general boarding. Fist zone was special needs and anyone with children, so that was already \u2153 or more of the plane. Then zone 2 is those with recognized status, I forgot what zone 3 is, but after that is general boarding. So already you don't get any special treatment. The seats were slightly larger than economy and my 52 lb suitcase was permitted. There was a lot of activity with the attendants, so I figured they were preparing some food for the 3 hours in the air, but the only thing they did was give everyone on the plane 1 tiny paper cup of juice, coffee or tea. There was nothing else. RE Entertainment. There is none, but WIFI was free (that was nice). Cost of flight was about $1,000 RT and length of flight about 3 hours each way. I'll have to try a different airline next time; it was disappointing.",

This was our second experience with their Business Class (We had flown from Dallas to Narita in Business Class as well). On both the flights the main meal was superb and the rest of the options for food and drinks were tasty and nicely served. I was surprised though that for such a long flight they only have one \"scheduled\" meal and rest is \"whenever you wish\". You almost wish they had another lighter scheduled meal.\nThe Sky Suite  gives a fully flat seat with extra cushion bed provided if needed. The planes are relatively new models and are fairly quite. Compared to our Business Class experience in other airlines this is still far better.",

I have to admit, I find it hard to sleep on any plane... but the middle seats in business are the ultimate in isolation from anything around you... just put up the adjacent partitions and voila! Also JAL\u2019s meal service is great offer choice of either Western or Japanese menu and after the initial service you can order anything a la carte anytime up until 2 hrs before landing directly from ur personal communication device.  The movie selections could be better and more numerous but not a problem on this overnight.  The service from the extremely friendly and accommodating flight attendants could not have been better!

However, this time, I found the Dreamliner, Premium Economy seats uncomfortable and the foot rest was awkward to adjust (my husband's would not lower at all). The worst aspect though, was the awful food which was served as an initiative to give young chefs an entree into the world of commercial cooking. I could not eat the thick vegetable soup  accompanied by a hard roll which was served for breakfast. The dinner was luke warm and tasteless. It seems they were trying to serve western food instead of sticking to their own specialities of noodles, delicate sauces and small dishes. I would think hard about using this airline next time on this route. The problem is the opposition has two night time flights and this only has one. Would consider for flights to UK via Japan as service is usually excellent, planes on time, clean and reasonably priced.",

Either way we got the runaround with a few different people at the Haneda Airport. Most notably was an incredibly rude manager MASAMI OHASHI. I was shocked when she said she was a manager because the way she spoke and handled this was incredibly unprofessional. So rude and I felt extremely disrespected. I was interrupted nonstop by \u201cno no no no solution unless you pay more\u201d. We spoke with other staff members at Haneda and Bangkok and they promised to accommodate us on our returning flight but then when that time came they said \u201coh sorry we can\u2019t, the flight is full for those seats\u201d meanwhile we saw open seats on the plane. Just terrible lying to customers to save the money we paid and avoid refunding it.  Very cheap. Horrible experience I will never ever fly with this Airline again.

Unfortunately, for some personal reasons, a few weeks later I had to call them for rescheduling our flights onto Feb 5, 2018 and April 27, 2018. After at least 3 hours waiting on the line, an operator answered my phone and told me that I had to pay extra $237 for rescheduling including $75 changing fee and the rest for difference in fare. I agreed with that cost because I know the ticket price was no longer the same, logically, the price must raise up day by day.\nHowever I checked the current price of my mom flights on their website a few days ago. I was shocked knowing that the price at that moment is only $947, which is $247 lower than my actual payment and even $7 cheaper than our first booking price!!!They really know how to disappointing their customers!! I booked 2 months earlier and accepted the possibility that I may have to pay more for rescheduling because I didn't want to buy tickets when the price are already raise up. However it turned out to be my silly decision. That really doesn't make any sense to me. JAL has really brought me into the feeling that my family was tricked by the brand that we has been supporting for years!!",

Considering we bought our ticket through Jal main site we didn't think much of the transit time as we had done so multiple times in the past.\n\nThough this time, we noticed there was staff waiting for us to gave us a monorail ticket to domestic terminal. We managed to get out of immigration and luggage at 6:40am around which is 20min slower than my previous trip and would proceed to interchange counter to drop my bag usually. However, this time they want us to take monorail to domestic with our luggage. We got to station at 6:42am and board the train on 6:44am. We approached the reception counter 24 at 6:50 around. And after some phone by the staff we were asked to push our checked in baggage through security to go on plane as cabin luggage. However as we got to security, our Swiss army knife that usually accompany our checked in baggage were not allowed to go through and we were asked to abandon them which we are not willing due to the price of them. And hence we do not board the 7:10am flight.\n\nTo add insult to injury, we were told we could only be put on stand by without any promise of when or if we could get on to any plane. We decided to find other way to get to Fukuoka after another attempt at their ticketing office, which result in no ticket. So we wasted more money and lots of time on our first day to Japan where JAL effectively left us in lurch at Haneda airport.\n\nThe final blow by Jal was on 3rd day of the trip (the same day I'm writing this) where I went online to check my reservation and noticed it cannot be selected and my brother reservation just disappeared (I'm with their JAL mileage club). Which makes me think our tickets have been cancelled and effectively not only leaving us at lurch in Haneda but also in Japan with no ticket to get back to Singapore. There were of course no email about cancellation of our return ticket or any form of notifications.\n\nAt this moment, we are stuck in Japan with no ticket to get back. Given that all Fukuoka seats were full that day my gut says it's Jal elaborated way to seat bump passengers for their more prestigious members (unlike David Dao incident), if we were allowed to check in our baggage we would be on plane, if Swiss knife army an issue the staff could keep hold of them till we alight and we could board the plane. \n\nI'm currently reaching our to Jal on my 3rd day to check on my flight status before I escalate the situation accordingly. My advice is Avoid JAL at all cost, the slight edge of their company recently over ANA (due to ANA silly baggage policy few years ago which they have since fixed) had made them complacent. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.",

JAL loaded up our plane and then several hours later unloaded us at midnight with minimal explanation (the Captain was almost unintelligible) and then washed their hands of us at Narita airport.  \n\nOnce we were hustled back to the check in part of Narita there were literally no JAL staff there to offer and advice or assistance to the thousands of their customers who they had unceremoniously tossed off their planes.  The only \u2018help\u2019 we received was the advice that there were no hotel rooms and a poorly worded piece of paper which gave a range of phone numbers for us to call - none of which worked because they were closed for the night.\n\nApart from sleeping on the floor of the airport (which I get) - the bit I don\u2019t get why the next morning should have been bedlam and chaos.  The few JAL staff who turned up after their refreshing night\u2019s sleep had no idea (they were clueless) about what we should do next.  They kept referring us to a reservations number which wouldn\u2019t answer.  It was a farce, and everyone was openly laughing at the incredibly poor service that JAL provided.  I am convinced that JAL lost many many thousands of future customers that night.\n\nI finally got through to that JAL number almost 18 hours later and was offered a flight back a week later via Singapore.  I just laughed and asked whether it was an early April fools day joke.\n\nBy that stage I had given up on JAL.  \n\nMy experience with Qantas was the complete opposite.  They were at pains to help and got us on a flight the next day home.  In short they were fantastic - the complete opposite to JAL.  Still haven\u2019t heard a peep from JAL....and if course never will.\n\nIt makes you wonder about the culture at JAL.  That they literally abandoned their passengers at their home base for half a day without any help points to the fact that the airline and its leadership have severe problems.\n\nThe reason I am writing this is in the hope that someone from JAL reads this and understands that their performance that night was completely unacceptable.\n\nFor my part I will NEVER EVER FLY ON JAL AGAIN!!!",

Near the end of a 9 hour layover in Toyko, my husband\u2019s name was called from the gate while he was away taking a walk.  When I grabbed all of our bags to run over to find out why, I mistakenly left my brand new iPad on the chair (black cover on a black chair; I didn\u2019t see it while rushing). I only realized it was missing right before the plane took off.  I told a flight attendant, who was VERY kind and helpful throughout the flight to work on helping me find it.  I cannot thank her enough. Another airline person met me when I got off the plane to get my information, and I soon received a follow up email (and several after that to follow up).  We arranged for the item to be flown to Ho Chi Minh City where I was able to pick it up a couple of weeks later, again with the help of a very nice employee.  I hope we get to fly Japan Airlines again - between that, and providing my husband with a very nice gluten-free meal (he has celiac disease), it was an exceptional experience!",

        "review_text": "Our family of 2 adults and 2 children flew Premium economy from Sydney to Paris via Tokyo. Excellent service by onboard crew, great access to airport lounges, limited movie options, ordinary food but quite comfortable. Inconvenient transfer from Sydney to Paris via Tokyo as overnight stay required and 1.5 hour bus to change airports which we had to arrange ourselves.\n\nOur last flight from Tokyo to Sydney was cancelled due to the snowstorm on 22/1/18. Promised hotel and food vouchers when disembarking after 5 hours on the plane. Instead, all hotels were full - understandably with 200+ flights cancelled. Left with a sleeping bag, water and crackers to spend the night in Narita airport. I wasn\u2019t too concerned and was willing to put up with a sleepless night to avoid unsafe conditions. I assumed we would fly out in the morning on the same plane, it seemed logical.\n\nAtrocious communication and follow-up service. Nobody to speak to for 8 hours. We were told that our flight was cancelled (obviously) and we\u2019d have to call a number to book another flight(on the public phone or use for those without international roaming). Hours of waiting, no answer on the number given, no ground staff to talk to. We were fortunate that we booked through Flight Centre who were excellent and got us on a Qantas economy flight 2 days after our original flight (which JAL covered). They wouldn\u2019t, however, cover our accommodation or other expenses. We also had to get from Narita to Haneda - another saga of 4 train changes (with 50+kg of luggage) due to more delays and cancellations.\n\nOthers at the airport who booked online directly with JAL were left with no assistance and hours of waiting without information or food. I am unaware of how they managed after we left the queue of hundreds of people (with no one attending the desks).\n\nWeather issues are an understandable force of nature, being dropped by an airline like a dirty dish rag is disappointing and unacceptable. This airline is excellent when all runs smoothly but terrible when things go wrong. I\u2019ll never fly with JAL again.",

We took off from Hong Kong International Airport runway 07R at 11:04 (local time) and arrived Narita International Airport runway 34R at 15:19 (local time).\n\nI was sitting in seat 7A, the bulkhead business class seat located in the first row of the second compartment. No welcome drink was provided prior departure (it was standard procedure in HKG <> NRT route). Lunch was served at around 45 minutes after take off. Overall the service is just average. It is definitely not up to par. \n\nThe flight was smooth, however, the cabin of Boeing 787-9 was relatively noisy when comparing with Airbus A350-900 or Boeing 777-200/300.",

New Boeing 787-9 aircraft completed an excellent experience.  Premium Economy also gets you access to the Qantas lounge in Sydney.  If there is a negative, JAL flies into Narita which is much farther from Tokyo and the queues in Narita on our arrival lasted over an hour.  However I am guessing that this is not a regular occurrence.  JAL is the best airline I have flown in a long time.  Highly recommend Japan Airlines.",

The seat seemed more comfortable than most economy and the food was excellent served with proper cutlery. Then the best part, the toilets! Very clean and attractive and they had some gizmo that sprayed your private parts with warm water and I think it also dried it. I made sure my husband went to use this awesome toilet!  I know they have them in Japan but I didn't expect to see it in economy! I would fly anywhere they would go, unfortunately, not that many places from where I live.",

My second leg was a five-hour flight at night so I knew the crew would have some downtime as most passengers would be asleep. During the two-hour layover at Narita, I purchased a box of Chocolates for the flight attendants to share and gave it to them when boarding. They at first thought I wanted them to store the bag for me and I said no, it was for them to share with each other. Now I often do this because I am usually traveling as a backpacker and I am not especially well dressed after weeks/months on the road, on this occasion it was jeans and a Great Wall tourist tee-shirt. Foremost I like to do it because I know how hard they work and I want to express my gratitude for their efforts, that it also removes me from the category of just another person in cattle class in their eyes is a nice bonus. I am not sure if bringing a gift hit a Japanese cultural button but the reaction was like nothing I had ever experienced before. At different points of the flight, each attendant stopped by my seat to personally thank me and chat a bit, asking if I was a pilot or at least an airline employee. I literally could not pay for a drink, the Champagne flowed all through the night! Even when I insisted I had not done it for any kind of reward and would like to pay after the second one their response to this was to give me a diecast B777 in JAL livery, and more Champagne! When you fly your three biggest tools are, don't be a jerk, show appreciation and empathy to the cabin crew, express your gratitude before that moment at the door when deplaning!",

        "review_text": "One of the best parts of flying with JAL are the flight attendants and their professional demeanor. I was on a recent flight where some of the passengers were sick and they still kept their composure and smile. They are excellent in working with children and infants to make sure they are comfortable and safe. My only itch was with a flight attendant that took issues with one person standing up for a few seconds or two people heading to the restroom in what seemed like an emergency. Hopefully, she  had a glass of wine or two to decompress and calm her nerves. \n\nThe economy seats from SFO to Haneda were the most comfortable, but the economy seat that was assigned from Narita to LAX would have been tight on my knees had it been a middle or window seat. I traveled with my much shorter spouse which made the trip a lot more bearable. I highly recommend the premium economy seats if traveling from Japan to the US, since they often make offers to upgrade to premium economy at a reasonable price.\n\nI'm not sure what happened to JAL's in-flight dinning. I made sure to eat a full meal before entering the plane on my way back to the states. In-flight dining was much better years ago when I flew JAL. What they served recently even my kids refused to eat. They preferred lunch food than JAL In-flight dinning. They couldn't stand the smell of the soup that they served. The only thing that saved the day was the little cartons of  Haagen-Dazs to make up for the terrible in-flight meals.\n\n I miss the days when flights to Japan served bento box style Japanese food and my kids actually ate the airplane food and never complained.\n\nAnother negative about flying with JAL is that if the flight is operated by Japan Airlines, you won't be eligible for TSAPre for that flight. JAL is not a TSA Pre participating airline. I didn't mind since my children were of the age that allowed us to go through metal detectors instead. In the future, we would have to book through a participating airline.\n\nIn spite of the negative, JAL offers some really good international flight deals. If you want to fly with JAL, I do recommend premium economy seating and flying one stop to and from Haneda if you're going to Tokyo. Flying through SFO makes for much smoother traveling than flying multiple stops to LAX from my experience. Flying with Japan Airlines really depends on how you customize your traveling experience. It could be a 3 star or 4 star flying experience. \n\nFlying through JAL was much better overall than Delta or American Airlines in my opinion. However, JAL needs to work on their horrible in-flight dinning selections and participate in TSA Pre. I would give my flight experience with JAL a 3.5 overall.",

        "review_text": "I'm used to expecting, perhaps wrongly, that flying economy on an international flight will be a step above flying domestic economy. This is the first time I have felt that this was not the case. There were many substandard moments once we got on the plane (service prior to boarding was quite good!) ... but I will highlight that the saag paneer that I was eating turned out not to be paneer at all -- but chicken! I've ordered countless Hindu meals in the past -- and they've always been vegetarian. But, when I brought this to the attention to the head flight attendant, she wasn't at all concerned. When I asked about the next meal coming up, she said mysteriously, \"We'll talk then.\" Well, there was no talk ... she simply gave me the next meal saying that she feared it also had meat in it. When I tried to give it back to her, she said I could eat the fruit and the zucchini/tomato ... So, I left a ten hour flight not only hungry, but also will my digestive track acting up (I had not eaten meat in about 30 years, and my system was reacting to it.) Doing some research on-line, it turns out that Japan Air offers a vegetarian Hindu and a regular Hindu -- but no such distinction was clear to us when we placed our special meals. \n\nIn general, though, I found the on-board service quite mediocre, and will think twice about flying Japan Airlines again once this whole trip is over. \n\n(The woman who checked us in today onto another Japan Airlines flight was much more understanding -- I made an attempt to change today's meals. Whether she succeeds or not, for us the important thing is she made an effort. No such effort was made by the prior flight attendants. They had a tired and removed attitude to their jobs. \n\nOn a positive note, the in-flight entertainment was varied and engaging ...",

There was a mug of rich broth with some pasta, pickles & fruit in separate little bowls. A few people including me didn't eat the pasta. It looked Italian & there was no sauce.\nThe plane was a Boeing 787 & those aircraft are quite nice & quieter than previous Boeing I have flown in.

The food was actually very good. The touch screen was of a good size and very responsive with a wide film selection. Service was excellent. Having gotten engaged over the winter period, we mentioned it to the staff just during conversation on the plane. Towards the end of the flight two cabin attendants came over with a model plane and a signed postcard wishing us a happy future. A small but very thoughtful touch. \n\nAll in all a very good flight and 12 hours passed relatively quickly.",

        "review_text": "We were taking a 14 day cruise departing from Singapore on 12/06/2017. We booked a flight from LAX to NRT (with a connection to Singapore). While at LAX, the Captain announced that the flight would be delayed by an hour in order to facilitate a cargo transfer. Unfortunately, they were unable to make up the loss time during the flight. So towards the end of the flight, a stewardess came to my wife and I and informed us that they were going to hold our connecting flight to Singapore (Flt 711), so that we need not worry. When we disembarked in Tokyo, we observed a display board with the names of approximately a dozen passengers (of which our names was amongst them). A very polite young female JAL employee handed us an envelope. She didn\u2019t speak fluent English but she was able to communicate to us that there were boarding passes and bus vouchers inside the envelope. She further explained that we would need to claim our bags and catch a bus for Haneda Airport. By using our cellphone, we found that there was another flight leaving from NRT to Singapore in less than 2 hours. She then informed us that this flight was already filled. We then attempted to explain that the delay of our flight was not the result of a mechanical or weather issue, and that it was actually caused by a decision of the Airline to wait for delayed cargo. It had now been 22 hours since we left Las Vegas and we were quite exhausted. Were we now expected to retrieve our bags, go thru customs, somehow locate where to trade the vouchers for bus tickets, then find the correct bus stop, wait in line for the bus to load our luggage, and wait for the bus to make 2 other stops before arriving at the Haneda International Terminal?  We explained to the young lady that we were very tired and that we held Executive Platinum Status with \u201cOne World\u201d (and that we were currently traveling in Business Class).  We pleaded \u201ccould you please arrange for a taxi or airport limo to make things easier for us? Apologetically, she said there was nothing she could do to help us.\nAt this point we insisted to speak with a manager. When the manager arrived he was very polite, professional, and spoke excellent English. He also informed us that he was unable to arrange for private transportation to the Haneda Airport, but that he would personally escort us thru baggage claim and would obtain the bus tickets and show us where to catch the bus. This was a huge help, and we truly appreciated his efforts. Just out of curiosity, I asked him if we had been flying 1st class instead of Business, would they have arranged for private transportation. He replied \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say, No\u201d. This is actually very good to know. My wife makes several 1st class trips per year to Asia (as does her employees). There are always going to be occasional issues when taking long trips (this fact is entirely unavoidable). However, it all comes down to how well the issues are handled. Frankly, we believe this situation could have been handled far better than it was. It just seems to me that it\u2019s counterproductive and ultimately self-defeating for JAL to treat their VIP travelers in this manner.  JAL made the decision to wait for a late cargo transfer which caused us to miss our connection. JAL also made the decision not to pay the $175 it would of cost to minimize our inconvenience (which was also their fault).\nOn the way back, we flew on Cathay Pacific. I found their business class to be superior to JAL. The Cathay\u2019s seats are larger because the rows are 1-2-1 as opposed to JAL which were 1-3-1. Cathay also has a significantly larger library of movies and TV shows. However, the inflight service on both airlines was truly outstanding.",

The crew serviced lunch pretty early (before 11am Singapore time) before dimming the light for passengers who would like to sleep. Surprisingly, slippers (disposable) were provided for a relatively short day flight. Light snacks were provided about an hour or so before landing. The seats were clean & could be flattened completely to sleep; the entertaining choices, including some Japanese and Asian movies, were adequate. Overall, this was a solid business flight. Passengers flying business on this flight should note that the JAL lounge was not opened before the flight and they have to use a commercially contracted lounge. where the coffee was good but not the food.",

Excellent service and the food was completely edible, which is not something you can say for most flights nowadays, even in first class seats.  \n\nI have to add that I think there was only two classes of service on this flight--business (=first) and economy.

Good entertainment choices and movies thru the flight. Have to pay for WIFI.\nMy party of 3 was interested in upgrading to business class but recent upgrades to their computer systems only gave us a choice to do so at the airport. Upon checking in their systems were down so it took some time to find out how much more for the upgrade. Once price was obtained  and we were going to proceed with the upgrade we were told if we did there would not be any food for us. 5k per person and no food? The staff said they didn't have any extra available for the upgraded seats. We stayed in economy and food was just ok so I suggest for you to bring snacks or food for the long flight. Rice crackers and chocolate offered as snacks. Japanese beer, wine and drinks made up for it but we were starving by the time we arrived at our destination. On our way back we were better prepared so we loaded up on snacks and food. Overall convenience a plus, service a plus but food just ok.",

Our last international flight on United left us with a bad taste, as our seats were even smaller and narrower than ever before, and the \"friendly skies\" didn't seem as friendly as they used to be. So when we compared flights to Jakarta, we found that JAL had a direct flight and was comparable in price, and we decided to try them. \n\nWhat a breath of fresh air to fly JAL. The attendants were amazing. They were friendly and very helpful. They even put an improvised vegetarian meal together for us after they found out that we had not eaten anything because we had not ordered a veg meal on time. Not only that, but during the flight they got in touch with JAL ground crew and were able to get us a vegetarian meal for our next leg of the flight. That is real service!\n\nThe food is so much better than the stuff that the other airlines offer. And instead of plastic utensils they use real flatware.\n\nAnother thing that makes JAL stand out from the two American airlines: they keep the toilets clean in flight. When we are on an international flight on the other airlines, by the time we are half way to our destination the restroom is filthy and smells like an outhouse. In contrast, JAL's restrooms are maintained by the flight crew so they are clean throughout the flight. \n\nWe were were very impressed that even in economy we were treated with respect and like human beings. Thank you, JAL and your wonderful flight crew!",

I actually never like their Japanese meals so much. The standard of Japan Airlines is high and the service they provide is excellent. Good entertainment system and they don't just service ice cream, they serve Haagen Dazs!\n\nCheck in and departure were very easy as I am very familiar with Jakarta Airport. In fact check in was exceptional as the service was so nice.",

Breakfast was unappetising, with the main hot dish consisting of only a soggy omelette egg and a sausage on the return flight and some cold side dish. One of the criticial issues I encountered was that they changed my preferred seats twice and did not notify via email about the change even though the website stated that they will inform passengers of any change. On one of the changes which was due to a change in aircraft from a 767 to a 777, they even separated passengers that had chosen to seat next to each other, something which must have been done alogrithmically by backroom staff which showed they lacked service consideration in mind. Another seat change was made by the airline about 2 weeks before the flight without warning, and they rearranged our seating again, this time supposedly due to a new reservation system which they were rolling out between November and December 2017. Had to constantly log-in to their website to frequently check that our reservation and seats were in order. Other than that, the actual flight was uneventful.",

The one in NRT has showers, massage chairs and even a masseuse!! Food is also pretty good at the lounges. \n\nSeats inflight don't go all the way down, but at least it props up the dangling ankles. Incline is good too. Not bad for those with back problems. Food is also good. Service is always excellent. They even celebrated my birthday enroute! Thank you HK CREW!!!!!\n\nWas upgraded to business otw back. Nothing like attentive service. and free flowing of food and drinks.  The flat seat for sleeping definitely helps.",

It makes such huge difference for us, with the comfort of seats and other benefits that comes with it. The seats are wider, softer, and it comes with some goodies like slippers, toothbrush, eye mask and several other items.\n\nThe food and drink options are also better, and I do think we get treated better than in regular economy. Well, the food is not excellent, but it is airplane food, they can do but so much... From my experience, I prefer their food much better than food served on other non-Japanese airlines like United or American.  \n\nOne of the greatest benefit for us is the access to Airport Lounge. I call them the oasis at the airports, and it is such a nice way relax and enjoy some complimentary food and drinks while we wait for our flight. \n\nOne negative thing is that their website and mobile app are not user friendly. It takes so much time and effort to check in, compared to any other airlines that I flew with. The app only comes in Japanese language, and it really is completely useless if you are not using it from Japan (if you don't reside in Japan). I with if they can change their website and app design so that it is easier for us travelers to process online check in... \n\nTrips to Japan is a long flight, and with more comfortable seats, we can rest better, even thought the seats does NOT become a flat bed like in business or first class. It is still comfortable enough to get some sleep and rest. I would continue for fly with JAL, in Premium Economy for sure.

We were kept up to date with our place on the runway via announcements. The plane made up some time on the trip with the help of a tail-wind. Although we arrived only 22 minutes late, after landing, the Captain made an announcement that they were humbly sorry for the delay of 22 minutes (I love Japan, they are so respectful & considerate).\n\nI would definitely fly JAL again.",

I had flown JAL many years ago & at that time, it was nothing out of the ordinary (in the days when Qantas was exceptional).\n\nThe process to book was extremely difficult as it was during the period of the JAL major IT upgrade \u2013 I ended up using a 3rd party (for the 1st time - & probably last) to book the tkts. Having said that, I did phone JAL to sort out our seats (after the Agent had us sitting apart in different rows & then gave me the JAL ph number), after waiting 45 mins the person I spoke to was extremely helpful, sorted our seats & was very polite & patient.\n\nThe plane was clean, well-maintained, good leg room, good food, good in-flight entertainment, great service.\n\nWe usually fly SIA (have done so since Qantas went downhill) however I will look at JAL & compare for our next trip as I would fly with them again.",

JAL used to be \"over the top\" in amenities before the realities of competition forced them to rethink their business model.  This flight was efficiency itself from boarding to in-flight services.  I flew Business Class and the design was was different than I have experienced before.  On my flight you had what might be called an individual cubical where you could raise or lower a divider between yourself and the next seat over.  This would be nice if you were traveling with a significant other, or a colleague.  The food was good as was the service.  A nice feature is that you can order from a set menu throughout the flight. The seats fold out flat, and I arrived more rested than usual. \nOne thing I like is that JAL is accommodating on stopping over in Japan as part of your flight plan, something that can be difficult with other airlines, in my experience.  An added bonus is that Japan has to have among the world's best organized airports.  Getting through immigration and into town is made simple and if you get mixed up, there are people to get you to the right service.  I mean it is really quite pleasant, for a change.\nIf you have dietary needs. let them know well in advance.",

Let me say I did it all on the phone and perhaps the system works better on line but it was a nightmare! The usual wait time on the phone was close to an hour, they wouldn't book the flight till they sent me a form to fill out and made sure my credit card was accepted and you didn't even know if you had a ticket or not. For the departure from Bangkok we never did get a printed confirmation and there was a problem with which day the flight left.

I had a middle of the plane aisle seat and needed every relaxation tool available to avoid claustrophobia. \n\nThe food was forgettable.  But the seat did have personalized entertainment with both Japanese and English language programming. Crew did their best, but I got the feeling that there were not enough lids to cover all of the pots.",

The lounge in NRT on the other hand was amazing and we took advantage of it whilst we waited for our next and final flight (different airline unfortunately).\n\nOn boarding the flight we were greeted by the staff and took our seats. Moments later we picked our breakfast choice and were given the option of a polite prod to wake us up gently when it was being served.\n\nI wish I'd taken photos of the food because presentation was excellent. The service was great and they have the only lie flat seat - that I know of - that I could stretch out on, and I'm almost 6'3\".\n\nThe only thing I thought missing was a high armrest but it wasn't really needed.\n\nAll 6 of our very heavy suitcases arrived in perfect condition. We don't think that they were dropped or thrown either because there weren't any evident scuffs or bumps so I'd say they care there too.\n\nAll in all we thoroughly enjoyed the flight and can't wait to fly them again.",

Tip for those who have very picky toddlers bring your own food, like for us we bought Popeye's and brought it with us in the plane. totally worth the carry-on. Then the same thing from Manila to the US,(Jollibee). Entertainment was awesome. Lots of new movies.  The only thing that I can suggest is maybe more english speakers for the flight attendants. Other than that Overall we enjoyed flying with JAL and will fly again with them.",

Then I told the male crew about my destination and flying class. He allowed me to go the check in counter. I felt frustrated and disappointed about the airline for unequal treatment for customers. It seems that JAL to become a 5-star airline should consider the issue. \nGenerally, all other crews were polite and professional. the flight was operated by Boeing 787-8.The JAL sky suite was contemporary, spacious, state-of-the-art controller and a large TV mon.

I was so impressed I joined the frequent flyer program, I will fly with them again for sure.  There is something about the Japanese service, just first class no matter where you are sitting.

Cabin crew are very friendly, courteous, helpful and really pay attention to passenger's requests. The seat is private and comfortable though I wish it could be a real 180 degree reclining seat. But that's ok. It has a decent amount of leg room. In-flight entertainment is worth also mentioning. They are superbly categorised and well organised. You can't get bored while flying. The headphones are decent, with noise cancelling alternative. The cabin is on par with typical Japanese standards: super clean and well maintained. The food on this flight is awesome, given the late night departure. I love the way the airline communicate with passengers about the meal options. Cabin crew would ask you to choose your breakfast (Japanese or Western style) or you could write it down in a form they provided. If you follow this option, they would politely wake you up (when it's time) and serve you the meal of your choice. To sum it up, I'm impressed by services provided by Japan Airlines. I have few things to complain about. What's not to love?",

Great range of movies and entertainment on a large touch screen. Only thing I was not keen on was the food but that was probably just a personal taste thing. Totally recommend JAL.",

We chose round-trip business class flight  Bangkok - Kansai Airport. \n\nAfter checking-in at Suvarnabhumi Airport, we got a premium lane to go thrugh security checked and immigration formality. We had visited Miracle Lounge and Sakura Lounge. There were lots of foods and drinks, staffs were helpful and polite. I think it's a japanese standard that I heard before.\n\nThe really touching japanese culture, it was happened after boarding. Cabin crews were very polite, nice, smily and excellent service. I tried japanese alcoholic drinking (I didn't remember the name) and japanese breakfast. That's great!! I'm very impressive.\n\nThe Boeing 787-Dreamliner business class seat was angle-flat seat , so sometimes I slided down. \n\nFor Sakura Lounge at Kansai Airport, it had relaxing, quiet zone. But less choices of food. No toilets in lounge area, we had to use toilets in gate area instead (I think it was under renovated).",

The other reason was my expectations of a much better food experience. I was terribly disappointed by the food and the whole meal service. Neither the Asian food selection or the western food offered were desirable AT ALL,this also applied to the beverages offered. I did not eat anything they offered I ate anything over the 11 hour flight except what I had in my backpack ( this reminded me the lack of any food on the US domestic airlines) \nIf it was not for the airplane I would have give JL an even lower rating.

My expectations were met: the crew and staff were very courteous and helpful. I had to transfer in Tokyo and I mentioned that to a staff at the counter in NYC. When I landed in Tokyo, an airport staff was waiting for me to help me with the transfer (I had to go through customs, get my luggage and then re-register for a domestic flight-all within 1 hour). The food was nice and seats comfortable. I saw the crew leaving notes for passengers, who were sleeping during the food service, in case they want to eat later. A practice apparently common for JAL and ANA, but something I've never seen on any other airlines (in US, Britain, Spain, France). Considering that flight from NY is 14 hours the comfort of seats and service were very important.  Overall, recommend.",

From Tokyo to Jakarta is about 7 hours.the food great along with the service by the cabin crew and their attention to detail and to peoples' needs. They are and have been consistently less, money wise, than the other comparable carriers; from several hundred to sometimes near a thousand less. We have booked them them the last three trip to Indonesia, all very good and on time. They are worth a look!",

However, I had a window sky suite seat which was very private (with the divider up) and the 787 was much newer without the privacy, but still lay flat seats. \n\nIt is the service on JAL that was impeccable. Both flights were on time with boarding done in an orderly fashion and included bowing from the gate agents as we entered the jetway. The politeness and eye contact of every employee was impressive. \n\nThe prepared meals were good. Although a bit too sophisticated for my tastes, with a salmon salad and amuse bouche. But the quality of the steak and flavor of the sauces was superior. There was also an anytime menu with a few options. \n\nThe seats are comfortable and the in-flight entertainment system had plenty of options. The lavatories while small, contained mouthwash and toothbrush/toothpaste (get them while they last). All business class passengers, receive an amenity kit which was adequate but not stellar, slippers and wireless headphones. \n\nApparently, there were mattresses that could be placed on seats to make them feel like beds in the overhead bins. However, I was not aware of them until my return flight. \n\nAll in all. This is a great product and what distinguishes it is the service and attentiveness of the staff. The price of the ticket was lower than the carriers I priced (Cathay, Qatar) and I liked the connection through Tokyo. How many times have you seen ground staff line up and bow toward the aircraft during pushback???",

You don't need to \"throw\" a cardboard box at your paying customers.  I didn't even experience that on US airlines - truly an Australian \"tradition\" food in takeaway containers.    Well done JAL!

Also the flight crew station area seemed to provide a little relief.  \nI guess the one good thing was we flew way up - passed Midway, which was pretty cool to see. Also flew right by Mt. Fuji - As close as one can get, i guess.  That was a pretty awesome sight to see.  \nCheck in at HNL a little long but that's almost everywhere.  Other than that, it was ok.  Just cool the jets !",

The flight attendants were all very nice and attentive. They have class (elegance) and good manners as well as respect for their passengers, who keep them employed. I enjoyed both the dinner and breakfast, which was Gyudon made by Yoshinoya!! The Gyudon was quite a surprise, and it tasted really good in the cabin where the air is circulated and very dry.   A cabin attendance came to my seat, and she apologized about the cancellation of my flight from Chubu to Narita earlier that day. She said she wanted to make sure that everything else went fine with my transfer at Narita. It was very nice of her to do that. I enjoyed watching a few movies and listening to music on board.

The headphones provided were not noise-cancelling, or provided very little, as it was difficult to clearly hear movie entertainment.

First of all, unlike a lot of other airlines, they really take the spirit of honoring OneWorld status (I have status on American).\n\nCheck in was easy and we were able to get our seats changed to sit together. The flight was comfortable with decent food (never expect \u201cgreat\u201d food in economy on any airline)  and a lot of good entertainment options in terms of a movie selection.\n\nWhat really set these guys apart was, on the way back, I didn\u2019t realize that I needed an eTA (electronic travel authorization) to fly back into Canada - it\u2019s a $7 form that you fill out that normally gets approved within 72 hours (note - non US passport holders now need this while flying to Canada)\n\nThe staff at JAL went into a helpful overdrive, showing me how to get to the website and apply and then bringing chairs etc for us to wait while it got approved (and the supervisor came in and called some special number that airlines have to contact Canadian immigration to accelerate the approval). \n\nThis is the most polite and helpful ground staff and flight staff I have ever seen across any airline. Definitely added them as an option for me anytime I fly to Asia. Heads and shoulders above the service you get on any domestic North American airline!",

Both meals were western type meals, the first being a tomato based pork dish served with rice, veggie salad, yogurt, etc.  It was not appetizing.  Red and white wines were good, beer and sake too, but not like how I remembered with a refreshment service cart being strolled down the aisle.  Return trip meal was a hamburger w/egg, rice, etc.  I took a tiny bite of the hamburger...yahk, salad was just lettuce with tiny slivers of bell peppers, yogurt was warm, but I enjoyed the sweet roll.

The only caveat about a window seat is that if you are a larger person, the little alley to get to your seat is quite narrow. That is the only negative I have to say about this airline product. The service was impeccable. The food delicious. The seat/bed was wide, long and comfortable. The TV huge. The partition screen moved up completely and provided me total privacy.

        "review_text": "Flying Business Class across the Pacific Ocean is a big deal to myself as it doesn't happen often.  I had booked my flight from LAX to Osaka with business class and unfortunately I had done all my research assuming that JAL had the same kind of seat in their LAX to Osaka run as LAX to Tokyo (Sky Suites). Definitely not the case. Which had me somewhat wishing I had just booked LAX to Tokyo.  \n\nThe Shell Flat Neo seats DO NOT LAY flat, they are at a downward angle so you slowly slide out of your seat and it just feels odd.  The Shell Flat Neo seats are also not as comfortable as the Sky Suites on lots of other JAL flights.  You also will not have as much privacy with Shell Flat Neo seats as they are much more open.\n\nI had a middle seat which in this case unless you know the person next to you is better than a window seat. Simply because if the person is sleeping or relaxing in the aisle seat and you have the window and you cannot get out of your seat without asking them to sit-up or re-position their bed every time you wish to use the restroom or move a bit.  Not great.  Still far better than coach of course but not a great choice by JAL to put these in.   One other note about comfort and I had read this before about JAL flights the cabin is kept extremely warm for westerners, so be ready!  \n\nAs for the service and food, the service was great, I will not say excellent because my travel companion and I many times felt like we were a bit overlooked vs Japanese passengers likely just because of our lack of speaking Japanese so they tended to get more service.  But extremely friendly service and helpful whenever they could be.\n\nFinally the food as I skipped most of the Japanese meals since I do not love eel and other delicacies was not bad as I choose a \"Western Meal\".  In this case steak.  The steak on the way to Osaka was wonderful but that is about all I cared for.  If you are a foodie that likes fancy food then this menu is for you.  If you are more simple in your taste, well best of luck.\n\nGiven that I went on 5 other JAL flights after this all business class, if its a choice I would go LAX to NRT just to get the more comfortable seats and privacy.",

        "review_text": "Today my husband and I flew back to Vancouver by Japan Airlines.  During the eight hour flight, they served us two meals: dinner and breakfast.  The dinner was designed by six red seal chefs and showed something creative and different.  We completed the full meal.  The breakfast was a Japanese gyuudon/ meat and rice package by a famous chain restaurant Yoshinoya.  I brought it home to share this comic like meal with our kid.\n\nBetter than the good food service was the attentiveness of a flight attendant.  My husband by mistake left his i Pad under his seat.  The professional and friendly, Ms. Inoue, brought it to us personally while we were picking up our checked-in luggage! I was awed by her service way beyond her duty.  It would not have happened if we had flown with any other airlines.  I possibly flew with 20 airlines in the past, but Japan Airlines service quality is incomparable.",

They served one hot meal and some snacks along the way.    Landed in Hong Kong about 20 minutes ahead of  the schedule.    All in all, you just can't seem to go wrong with all Japanese carriers.

There are some light snacks and a meals available on the upper level as well.  A good start to a long day. \n\nI had a bulkhead seat which offered spacious legroom, search for this option on Seatguru when booking.  While the seats do not lie flat, there is a decent enough recline with footrest that will enable you to get some need shuteye.  The 787-900 is the way to go on long haul flights with better air quality and dimming windows.   I ordered a kosher meal for the flight which was OK, but there are snacks, soft drinks and tea available throughout the flight.  Bathrooms were clean and service was generally very good. \n\nThe only weaknesses were the inflight entertianment and wifi.  The inflight entertainment is a little thin on interesting material in English.  Better to download and bring your own.   Wifi service is spotty,  on the flight over it did not work north of the Arctic Circle.\n\nOverall excellent service and a very comfortable plane.  The price difference between premium economy and business class is significant, but you are mostly paying for the lie flat seats.  This makes premium economy and good value.",

        "departure": "Tokyo",
        "destination": "Bangkok",
        "type_of_route": "Southeast Asia",
        "review_text": "I took the 12:40 am flight from Tokyo Haneda airport to Bangkok and found the schedule to be very efficient and effective. The flight departs late at night and arrives very early in the morning lessening the risk of delays due to airport congestion.  Also by arriving so early in Bangkok, traffic time into the city is substantially reduced.  I normally allot 1 to 1 1/2 hour to get from the airport to my Bangkok city hotel in the Silom area but was told by the hotel car driver that before 6 am in the morning, travel time from airport to hotel is only 1/2 hour since there is little traffic. \n\nThe flight is also well designed for sleep onboard.  The seats are older shell flat angled-flat seats without direct aisle access for window seats but as I had booked the first row aisle seat, my seatmate in the window seat could easily step over my seat even if it is in the bed position as there is plenty of room between the seat and the bulkhead in front.  The plane used is an older B777-200 with a 2-3-2 seat configuration in business class so if you are in the middle seat in the center section, access would be more of an issue.  \n\nAs the flight departs past midnight, meal service is breakfast 1 hr 45 min. before landing rather than shortly after take-off.  On boarding, each business class customer is asked to fill in a form indicating whether he or she wanted to be woken up for breakfast and whether the Western or Japanese breakfast is chosen.  As a result, lights are kept dimmed from take-off until about 2 hours before arrival, I and most other passengers in business class immediately switched to bed position after take-off as soon as the seatbelt sign was turned off and managed a bit over 3 hours of sleep on a less than 6 hour flight.  Also because it is such a late departure, pretty much everyone on board goes to sleep after take-off so it is quiet in the cabin and there is little to disturb your sleep. \n\nThe Western breakfast served prior to landing was impressively full in offering.  There was a duck salad and a mushroom omelette, really good bun and/croissant, fruit and Greek yoghourt.  As always, JAL services its special brand of coffee in business class which is among the best coffees I have had on a plane.  My only criticism is that the coffee is not available for purchase and only served in flight. \n\nOn landing, getting through customs and immigration was very quick as there were not many other flights arriving that early in the morning so the usual long lines at Thai immigration was non-existent and luggage delivery was quick.  From landing to getting into the car arranged through my hotel to arriving at my Bangkok hotel, it took only about an hour which is incredibly quick for Bangkok. \n\nOverall, this flight is a good choice for an efficient arrival and to get full use of your first day in Bangkok on arrival.\n\nPrior to departure, I used the Haneda JAL First Class lounge as I have OneWorld Emerald status.  The lounge is truly superb.  Lots of room in the lounge, outlets at all seats, good view of the planes docked at the gates and a great dining area with plentiful food options.  There was even a cook to order section where a chef made grilled special Japanese cut of beef with either a Japanese sauce of a truffle sauce.  There were two soup offering including a lobster bisque, a Western hot food offering of multi-mushroom pasta, two kinds of dim sum, Japanese udon and curry, and a selection of bite size cold appetizers including foie gras on toast.  I arrived very early on a connecting flight that had landed in Narita airport and took the limousine bus between the two airports arriving more than 5 hours before my flight.  The lounge actually is very quiet until about 10 or 11 pm when it suddenly fills up as Haneda airport has a number of long-haul international flights that depart late at night for an early arrival at their destinations.",

        "type_of_route": "International",
        "review_text": "JAL continues to use an angle flat bed seat in Business Class on its B787 Dreamliner flights from Vancouver to Tokyo in a 2-2-2 configuration with the window seats not having direct access to the aisle.  Normally this is not a problem as I always select the aisle seat next to the window seat, and the typical JAL business class customer is a Japanese man who is not very large and can get in and out of the window seat by stepping over the aisle seat without too much problems.  This flight though, I had a Caucasian larger gentleman in the window seat next to me and he was not familiar with the JAL seat configuration.  He had to ask the flight attendants to help and to wake me to fully convert my seat to upright before he could access his window seat as he was not used to the step over concept and as he was probably not too coordinated having consumed at least 4 or 5 whiskeys within the first couple of hours of the flight.  This need to convert my seat from bed to seat position each time he had to exit or return to his seat made sleep difficult, so really given this is an overnight long-haul flight, it is time for JAL to upgrade this route to a plane featuring one of its more recent business class seats with a horizontal flat bed and direct aisle access from each seat. \n\nDifficulties with my neighbour aside, the flight was fine and featured JAL's trademark superb service.  The flight attendants were most polite in asking me to adjust my seat to accommodate the ingress and egress of my seatmate, were constantly cleaning the toilet after each use by a customer, and even paid attention to really small details like always turning the water glass each time they brought me water so that the JAL logo on the glass exactly faced the customer!\n\nI had the Japanese meal for both the lunch and the prior to arrival snack and both were very good, featuring numerous little small bites with interesting seasonal flavours. \n\nOne relative weak point is the entertainment system, which has a much smaller selection of movies than for example Cathay Pacific has on its Vancouver to HK route.  Also, many of the non-Western movies from Japan, Korea, Hong Kong, India etc. were only available in their native language and then maybe Japanese so that an English only speaker actually cannot take advantage of much of the movie and TV programs lists. \n\nThe plane is new and the service is superb, but the angled flat bed and lack of direct aisle access from each seat makes this business class offering a bit behind the times for an overnight flight where undisturbed and good quality sleep is a prime measure of \nsuccess.",

We had 8 hours in LAX before our flight so we tried checking in online to get our seats reserved, the mobile site would not allow it, so we decided to wait at the gate until an attendant arrived so we could check in. 1 hour before the flight started boarding the attendant arrived and when we checked in they put us on opposite ends of the plane (it was our honeymoon) so we were not pleased to spend 14 hours apart for the start to our vacation. Luckily the airline was able to make some changes and put us together moments before the airline began boarding which we greatly appreciated. At the end of our vacation we didn't want this happening again, so 24 hours before our flight we attempted the mobile check in again. This time it let me put my information into the check in services but could not locate my name or reservation number. Highly displeased that we are having so many issues with our check-in with this airline. Hope it gets resolved.",

They just paid so much attention to detail.\nThe aircraft, a B787 on both flights, was new, clean and extremely comfortable.\nThe meals were delicious and they provided a selection of western and Japanese choices.\nI have flown a lot over the years and on many airlines, but JAL was, without any doubt, the best I have ever experienced.\nI have never recommended any airline on social media before, but I had never flown JAL before either.",

I find their business class fares competitive, and their service is great, but there are some caveats and that probably explains the competitive pricing. \n\nOn the Vancouver Narita route JAL flies the B787 Dreamliner. Business class is a 2-2-2 layout. There\u2019s no staggering on the window side so it presents access issues for anyone on the window seat. You need to jump over your neighbor to go to the washroom. \n\nAside from the layout the other big letdown is the angled flat bed. Seriously what was JAL thinking? Why put angled flat bed. They have a much better Sky Suite version which flies on the Narita Sydney route, among others. \n\nThe service is very good. Organized. Punctual. Always with a smile. \n\nMenu is limited for business class. Pretty much a choice of Japanese or Western food. Wine selection is okay. \n\nThis flight is a decent one for a daytime journey but not ideal for a nighttime flight.",

(By all means this is our fault in our part and we don't blame the airline what's so ever). This caused a delay on their flight. \n \nI called JAL customer service directly. The man that I talked to didn't sound friendly all but I told him the situation I am in. He reviewed my confirmation and told me that he couldn't help me out because I bought my ticket through a third party(like a person that doesn't want to deal with you kind a way).\n\nI called Priceline.com, a person by the name (Tris) was such a great help. I told her the situation and exchanged information to JAL represented. I wanted to rebook the 3 tickets but JAL was asking $4100+, (Tris) advice just to purchase new tickets. I asked how much to cancel the tickets, according to JAL it's $600per/tickets for \"no-show\", they don't have proof that it was a \"no-show\". I told that my (sister in-law, nephew,niece) did show and were on time which and we have proof. I was supposed to be charged $300per/tickets because they did show during departure but just couldn't leaves due to documentation. \n\nThe conversation wasn't getting nowhere, I was already late to work. I told (Tris) to just cancel all reservations and I can't deal with this airline any longer. JAL charged me $1800 with a refund of $300. \n\nThis was my first and will be my last to book for JAL.\n\nAccording to their Fares Rules and Restriction: PENALTIES\nFARE RULES TEXT\nUNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED NOTE - RULE PS05 IN IPRG\nAPPLIES\nGENERAL RULES TEXT\nFROM/TO PHILIPPINES\nCANCELLATIONS\nBEFORE DEPARTURE\nCHARGE USD 300.00 FOR CANCEL/REFUND.\nNOTE -\nIN CASE OF NO SHOW -\nCANCELLATION CHARGE USD 600.00 APPLIES.\n--------------",

She took me to the customer service area from the ticket counter.  It was unbelievable how awesome she was.  I was also trying to upgrade by cash to business class.  Without going deep into it, she found my bag and said i can go in through security.  Once i was at the gate waiting on boarding, she came into the waiting area with my bag to confirm it was the right one.  I was amazed..  i said yes and she walked me down the concourse to the plane and said \u201ci will personally put it on the plane\u201d. I was like great and she apologized since she was unable to upgrade me due to \u201cAA\u201d rules of course on code share.  I said oh well, we tried..  after i boarded she came to my seat and said how is it?  I said if i knew it was going to be roomy and nice like this i wouldn\u2019t have worried about the upgrade haha.  She smiled and said thank you and thank you for flying with us.  Truly first class service even in couch..",

The food -- even in Economy -- is excellent and immaculately presented.  The wifi service is bombproof and there is no restriction as to how it's used (as there is on most airlines).  \n\nWhat I don't get is why some of these Asian air carriers are so so so much better than our domestic airlines in the USA.

Apart from the friendly, efficient service I received, JAL was honest and sensitive in a way that I have not seen on other airlines. Soon after I boarded the airplane an announcement was made that our meal would be served early because the pilots were expecting serious turbulence later in the flight. As it turned out I didn't eat anything when the meal was served because I didn't feel hungry. Much later, a flight attendant asked me again if I wanted a meal. By that time I was hungry and accepted the offer. The flight landed a little later than expected because the pilots had to take a detour to avoid a storm. This, however, was explained to us in a very gracious, professional manner. I was so impressed with JAL.",

The employee at check-in at the Hong Kong Airport Express location in Central was the best airline employee I've ever come across...I had some ticketing issues that he had to call in and resolve for me, and then come find me at the nearby Starbucks to tell me he did so.  What a guy!  So for the good...attentive and classy personnel, good food quality (for a plane), wine, great entertainment options, cleanliness, on time and the 787 was quiet and has large windows that dim electronically.  The downside is the legroom...I would rate this flight much higher, maybe 5 stars if the legroom was decent, because everything else was great.  Unfortunately JAL has not resisted the urge to cram as many seats onto a plane as possible.  At 6'4\", I notice more than others the difference in legroom.  I came into HKG on a Garuda Indonesia flight on an Airbus A330 (similar sized plane) and they are massively more gracious with the amount of space given in Economy class.  Also the fact that you cannot reserve your seat easily during ticket purchase or prior to the flight departure is another downside for Economy class.  Would I fly them again?? Maybe...but only if there weren't similarly priced options available on more spacious carriers (Cathay Pacific, Garuda, Singapore, etc.)",

Check-In was fast and easy as I had arrived early to the airport and as a One World Sapphire member was able to use the Business Class counter. JAL uses the Air France lounge which is fine but the food was not replaced on a regular basis. I got the feeling the lounge was doing the bare minimum as there were not any AF flights departing at the time. Lounge access for all Premium Economy is a nice perk not provided by other airlines.\n\nThe seating was great and the configuration of the Premium Economy section works well. There are two toilets in the front that appeared to be for Business Class but were also used by the Premium Economy section too. This layout is much better than the Cathay Pacific layout that results in passengers walking over people in the bulkhead row or going to the back of the plane.\n\nWhile I prefer a seat that reclines vs. \u201csliding down\u201d the combination of a larger than normal pitch and the fact that the person in front is not reclining into your space makes the hard shell seat a winner!\n\nThe food was fine, nothing great and the service was very good throughout the flight.

When I woke up 2 hours later, I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. I still saw tarmac and grass. Turns out we have been waiting for the weather to turn for the better and haven't budged. While we were in the air, I realized I might not make my connecting flight to Akita. I asked the flight attendant about it and she did her best to give me updates. Even she didn't have more information she came back to tell me she is waiting for an answer. Turns out I only had 1 hour to get past customs, collect my luggage which I was planning to ship because they were large and awkward (I was carrying 2 instruments) and get to the other terminal and board. When I got off the plane, a JAL employee met me and helped carry my luggage all the way to the other terminal. Unfortunately the carts were not allowed so he carried them by hand. I felt very badly for him but was so grateful. Thanks to all the staff, I was able to make my flight and see my parents the same day. I was so concerned I would have to wait until the next day. I couldn't be more happy. My reason for not giving 5 stars is because the food really could be better. There is fruit on top of somen and other odd combinations. I usually bring my own food. Despite the food I will continue to fly JAL because of the amazing service.",

Row 5 is also in it's own private cabin between first class and the galley so not many people and much more private than the main business cabin.\n\nWith their mattress it was very comfortable for this very long flight.  Service was very attentive with frequent and generous refills of wine.\n\nA big disappointment for me was the food.  A choice of Japanese of western menu I opted for the western as some of the Japanese options were too adventurous for me. The squid for the starter has very little flavour and was very tough.  Beef fillet was ok and cooked well considering but on small side.  I had better luck with the Japanese Beef Curry which is on the snacks menu you can order anytime, tasty although a little cold.\n\nIf the food was better, this would have been best business class flight I have ever taken.",

When the seats in front of us were put back it was almost impossible to get out of the seat. The flight from Sydney to Tokyo was very comfortable with more keg room and decent seat recline. We are sitting at the airport now waiting for our flight back to Sydney. It is an evening flight so it will be interesting to see how comfortable an overnight flight will be.

Then noticed the windows can be tinted electronically and you can choose how dark the window you want to be as opposed to most aircrafts where you can only block the window. And lastly, the space between seats are decent compare to other airlines",

JAL are one of the best. Their in-air service is friendly and attentive. You feel like your service is personalized and that they are genuinely interested in making sure you have the best possible experience. On top of that, on my last outbound flight, one of the cabin attendants accidentally returned to me the wrong suit jacket. I didn't notice until I arrived at my hotel. JAL ground service and lost and found were amazing, sending me multiple emails, checking with cabin crew and genuinely trying to track down my jacket. On my departure, at the Narita check-in desk, one of the lost and found staff met me in person to sincerely apologize for this error. I was left with the impression that they had gone above and beyond what you'd expect from an average airline.",

For toddler, they served the rice cracker and banana immediately after boarding, which was a good surprise. That ensure the toddler won't go crying because of hunger. The proper meal served was mainly assorted blended vegetable like mashed pumpkin, spinach etc. Not to my toddler liking though. But still very good effort. For kids meal, very nicely done up with lots of choice. Big serving. \nSeat was comfortable. Flight was punctual. The only complaint that i had was the aircond. The only flight that i felt warm in the plane compared to all the other airlines. It's probably good for fuel consumption and energy friendly, but slightly too warm for passenger as we ended sweating in the plane.",

        "review_text": "I've had the privilege to experience different J classes of various carriers and I have to say JAL tops the cake. From the gracious, helpful staff, sumptuous meal and comfy seat, JAL has really created a high bar when it comes to business class. \n\nI originally started my trip from Seoul to Narita on a 737, but my review is about the flight from Tokyo to Los Angeles on board the 777. \n\nTransiting at NRT was pretty painless - just had to go through security. Make sure laptops are out and no liquids more than 100 ml. Once past security, I made my way to the tranquil Sakura Lounge. Definitely try their curry with rice! I prefer the design of Haneda with its open floor and plenty of natural lighting. Narita is a bit of a dungeon compared to Haneda! But I digress\u2026\n\nAfter some r&r, I made my way to the gate. JL boards families with tots and those that need assistance. Afterwards, First Class (FC) and Diamond members are welcomed on board. Then Business and Economy. I soon settled into seat 10K (window) in the primary business section. There's a forward biz section just behind FC. A flight attendant came by to introduce herself and served champagne and offered reading material. \n\nThe SkySuite is exemplary. Once the partition goes up, it's like you're in your own cubicle - in a good way. Although there is a seat next to you, you still have aisle access. For comparison's sake, British Airways has a similar layout but you're not afforded your own aisle access and (gasp) have to hurdle over your facing neighbor. The screen is quite large and there is also a handheld remote to control content. The seat is upholstered, comfortable and has a massage feature. The seat also changes to a full-flat bed and an AirWave mattress topper is provided. The inflight entertainment (IFE) is quite extensive and contains new releases as well as classic movies. \n\nOnce airborne, the smiling FA s quickly commenced service. Unlike US carriers, I feel like FA s on most Asian carriers like their jobs and want to provide utmost service. I describe it as a \"white glove\" touch. They never seem hurried and pay attention to the detail (like ensuring the JAL logo on the wine glass is facing you). \n\nIf you're keen at all, definitely go for the multi-course Japanese menu. Our menu started with tofu and a dish of tuna, followed by a bento of Japanese appetizers. Then the main course followed (beef tongue and cod) along with rice and miso soup. My FA kept offering wine I had to politely decline. \n\nOnce dinner wrapped up, the FA advised me I could order anything off the handheld device. I think it's really great you can order anytime and not have to flag an FA or ring the call attendant button. The snack menu is quite extensive as well. Go for the ramen and pork cutlet sandwich. \n\nSadly, before I knew it, I could see the California coastline and we began our descent into Los Angeles. \n\nOverall, I was quite impressed with the whole flight. From the crew, food, bed and IFE, I will certainly consider JAL for my next trip to Asia.",

Sitting in aisle seats we could do nothing about this, apart from spending much time at the back where there were a couple of tiny windows.  The point of choosing a day flight is to have a normal night's sleep before, have a very long day travelling, then go to bed at the destination, resulting in minimal disruption to the body clock.  Passengers do not need to sleep for 12 hours during the day.  Westerly flight to the USA do not adopt this procedure.\n\nWhy on earth does the airline act in this ridiculous way?  My cynical guess is that it keeps passengers from making too many demands on the cabin crew.\n\nAlso, the in-flight \"entertainment\" consisted of a few children's films and some awful science fiction.

The meals were tasty & filling, often having choices between Japanese or western food & snacks. Personally I was happy to dive straight into Japanese flavours & cuisine. \n\nService was fantastic with nothing being a problem for the extremely professional staff. I found the choices of movies & entertainment good as well. The dimming of the cabins after our meals was great allowing a peaceful rest if so desired. Staff assisted me in learning some key Japanese phrases & pronunciation, which I was really grateful for. \n\nWe look forward to travelling to Japan again in the future & will not hesitate to go with JAL.

Unlike others very generous baggage allowance too and usually connect well for domestic flights or other international connection flights. \n\nIn flight service: great selection of movies, games, music from personal screen in front of your seats. Good selection of complimentary beverages are always helpful for long flight. \n\nBusiness Class: seat is exceptional and personalized attention to detail service is fantastic. They even come to your seat and make a bed with real good quality pillow and comforter, not to mention food & drink selection, quality, quantity are perfect! \n\nEconomy Class: \nFunctional well designed seats (USB charger, bottled water holder, etc), good polite service (not like many of Nothing American Airlines....there are no bad attitude to the guests). However, I feel quality of service and quantity of food has gone done slightly  compare to previous years (I use this airline 4+/yrs for last 20+yrs).\n\nThere were few incidents that encounter over the years with them, but at the end they usually make it right for the guests and overall still consider good flight experience. \n\nI have no hesitation recommending this airline.",

The flight from Sydney to Tokyo is under 9 hours and a Business class or premium economy ticket gets you into the QANTAS lounge in Sydney and the Sakura Lounge in Nikita (Tokyo). After a good night's sleep in one of the airport hotels, and a leisurely start to the next day, the Nikita-Paris flight is 12 hours, flying with the sun, so you arrive in the afternoon Paris time and, if you can force yourself to stay awake for a few more hours, usually you can get another good night's sleep and wake early to start your holiday. JAL offer both western and Japanese meals and the food is excellent, portion sizes are just right (not too big) and you can eat as much or as little as you want as they do a set meal, and then have an anytime menu. The staff are all lovely - so polite and charming. The seating pods are comfortable and, if you're lucky enough to score a window seat, they are completely private when you raise the screen between seats. In business class they stretch out completely flat and there are mattress pads, blankets, cardigans etc available. They usually have a good range of movies and games.",

They\u2019d probably commit seppuku before being portrayed in the media in any of the above incidents I kid you not.  Just look walk into a Starbucks, McDonalds, or any store, supermarket in Tokyo.  Excellent service is common in Japan from the low to high end.\n\nJapan Airlines comparatively is more than competent.  Boarding and exiting is well organized in a low key manner.  The staff greet and thank you as you embark and disembark.  The seats are not squeezed in to maximize profits as it cuts off circulation for people over 6ft.  Food is awesome with some local flavor dishes minus the third meal on long flights that is a more a snack (99c hotdogs for me), the attendants are all smiles and attentive asking if you need blankets pillows, extra snacks & drinks.  Long periods cooped up in a confined space is much more bearable with good movies, tv selection or just play games on your own iPad or Nintendo Switch.\n\nOverall Japan Airlines is a rare beacon of light in today\u2019s airline industry one that still treats its customers well coupled with the Japanese propensity for service it\u2019s a win.",

The first leg to Narita took about 6 hours, with a 3 hour transit which was perfect to get down and stretch our legs, and it was another 7 hours to Honolulu.  Narita airport is a fun place to walk around, do some shopping for snacks and have a delicious meal.  But the food in the plane was high quality as well and offered Japanese, of course, as a choice.  Most importantly, I found the service by the air hostesses to be excellent.  There were no male stewards (I'm not complaining), and I'm thinking perhaps it's a Japanese culture reason.  Inflight entertainment was good, with decent choices of new movies.  No problems at all checking thru our bags to our final destination and upon arrival our bags arrived at the baggage claim without issue.  Overall, I would definitely fly JAL again.",

Changing flights we were only charged A$100.00 each, but this was our choice, so considering what some of the \"low cost\" airlines charge, it wasn't too bad.

Qantas' cutlery worked like toys that could not cut anything and the serviette was just slightly larger than a tissue paper. For Air Canada I became hungry 3 hours after the main meal (luckily I got a lot of snacks with me). \n\nBut you need to be careful about one thing with JAL - do not choose the flight with connecting domestic flight provided by Jetstar. Not only you need to pay for everything (drinks, snacks) on board of Jetstar, the choices were limited and the service was below satisfaction.",

I didn't quite like the way the seat reclines in comparison to the conventional seats on the 777 apart from the wider seats on the 777.\nMuch have been said in forums about the less dry cabin conditions but on this approx. 7 hr flight it would not have been an issue. However I have to say the dreamliner is a much quieter plane and more high tech. Although the 777 is obviously older the condition is  still good.   \nIn terms of person to person contact experience I would say JAL is very good from the word go - checking in was pleasant enough on both ends.  Cabin service was also very good.",

We also know that Asian airlines are noted for better service, and it proved true again.  We had a code-share flight ELP-LAX, a six-hour layover (it's good we had United Club coupons from our son and his wife), 9.5 hours to TKO, 2 hours in TKO, and 5 hours to HAN.  All the reservations, check-ins, and flights went very well.  In TKO we took a break to make block prints of Hiroshige's famous wave picture.  On the way home, ee retraced our route, this time with a 10-hour layover in TKO (Oof!  Again, we had United Club coupons).  We had one interesting episode, trying to get from what I recall was terminal 3 in TKO to terminal 2, to get to the United Club for about 6 hours before returning to terminal 3.  Were we officially in transit on the inter-terminal bus and not entering Japan?  It took about 4 officials of various levels to figure out that it was OK...and it was the shuttle-bus driver who made the decision!  Again, the flights were all fine.",

Worse, as I was flying Business class on an almost empty flight which was delayed, I could not believe when reaching Haneda airport (although being the first to leave the flight and reach security) I witnessed lots of people (could not understand if they were Japanese or from nearby countries) who were joining the security queues together with friends, thus coming in front of me from what was originally an empty queue.  I moved queues 3 times, as this kept occurring, and I did not want to travel at midnight in a new city which I did not know.\n\nThe security guys kept asking people to open their suitcases - as if expecting to find diamond rocks!!!!!!! - and asked me the same then kept patting my 10kg suitcase (as I tend to travel very minimalistic everywhere) and only stopping when he reached my underwear bag!!!!!!  I could not believe these people are so intrusive, and worse, the security guy (a very tall, slim guy in his '30s) asked a tiny Japanese girl to check my body.  I said that I do not mind to check my there, in front of everybody, so she decided to pat my body absolutely EVERYWHERE!!!!  I was shocked as this did not happen to me in any other part of the world - worse than security people in third world countries!!!!\n\nI told this story to so many people and not one single person told me of a similar experience - clearly this show that 'important security guy' wanted to warm himself up by telling this kind of story and 'what he is capable of doing at work'!!!!\n\nThis was truly shocking and sickening to me, no wonder it put me off from ever returning to Japan.  Should this airline move their hub to a different location, I might consider visiting Tokyo again as no woman would want to encounter such rude, un-civilised and primitive people with such huge issues at work affecting people who simply travel the world thus contributing to the economy of that country!!!",

The flight attendants were very accommodating and spoke excellent English. The seats in the economy class were comfortable and spacious. It was nice that JAL gives their passengers free pillows, blankets, headphones, and complimentary meals, considering most other airlines make you pay for such things. The in flight movie selections were excellent. They had wonderful vegan meals provided to my boyfriend and I at no extra charge. Overall a very positive experience, I look forward to flying with JAL on my return to Japan next year!",

Her backward steps took her to the end of the galley where another female attendant appeared.They spoke in their native tongue , with the initial attendant voice being high pitched and indicating by arm and hand gestures ,a  person injecting themselves into the arm joint .I was distressed ,what had I done ? Here am I , a 68 year old bald short man who has a history of blood clots and I had just injected myself with clexane ,a blood thinner in accordance with medical advice, on long distance flights .I recapped the needle in the toilet ,stepped out and asked the flight attendant whether they have a needle disposal container , with the capped needle lying in the palm of my hand. I couldn't believe it.Another  flight attendant also in the galley , then looked up at the fuss, responded very politely that they cannot take needles , would I like a plastic bag .I  declined but told him I am a long term recreational traveller and am really distressed at how the attendant responded.\nI put a comment on JAL face book page but they have deleted it .This could be a safety issue .The attendant's  training or the attendant needs to be reviewed- how would she react in a real crisis! \nWhen I said I would report the matter and wished to left alone for the last 4 hours of the flight .This was not complied with- I was approached in my seat , whilst in the aisle waiting to disembark,I said leave me alone but another attendant approached me dispite my protests  walking up the air bridge with me .when I ignored her and again said leave me alone ,she approached my travelling companion who is Japanese about my concerns- shocking.  This is both a possible safety issue as well as the manner a passenger  was  treated and thereafter in my opinion harassed when I said I would report the matter. Really really disappointing and distressing at the time.I went to JAL comments/ complaints section .They say in effect , they may not reply , they may reply after a short period , ,if they do reply the reply is copyrighted to JAL  so here is my experience of JAL business class",

        "review_text": "This was my first experience of both JAL and premium economy. It covers 4 sectors - SYD-NRT, NRT-JFK and return\n\nCheck-in: priority bag drop for online checkin, but PE has priority itself\n\nThe Aircraft: 777-300 (3 sectors), 787-8 (one sector - NRT-JFK). Overall the 787 was quieter and more comfortable than the 777. The dimming windows on the 787 didn't block light fully, a problem on the south facing side of the aircraft trans-Pacific. On the 777, I understand PE is meant to share toilets with economy, but PE travelers used the Business class toilets immediately in front of PE. JAL has switched to 787-9 for SYD-NRT since March 2017\n\nThe seat(s): legroom is good (although still not quite stretch out and sleep for my 6'3\"). Plenty of adjustment. Large tray table, although this is reduced for bulkhead seats due to the seat arm storage of both it and the video screen. 777 is 2-4-2, 787 2-3-2 seats across (economy is 3-3-3 and 2-4-2 respectively)\n\nLounge access: a real selling point for JAL PE. Access to quality lounges in Sydney (Qantas), Narita (Sakura Lounge) and JFK (Air France) in order of preference\n\nFood and drink: interesting and tasty if you enjoy Japanese food. Certainly a cut above most economy offerings, even though PE is only a couple of add-ons. Champagne and shochu are PE specific, wine offerings average. Good range of soft drinks and beer. Normal barely drinkable economy and black tea as hot drinks, but also green tea and miso.\n\nService: Overall polite and attentive. Personal welcome by name as \"head\" of our family. My wife and I chose to sleep from boarding our final sector, and awoke to handwritten notes that our main meals were still available if wanted.\n\nEntertainment: \"JAL Moove - new sky entertainment\" is the musical sting at the beginning of every.new.entertainment.episode. Aaargh! The selection is quite reasonable for adults and teens, less so for younger. Not extensive, but reasonable quality.\n\nSummary: A very enjoyable experience. I've already booked JAL PE for SYD-NRT-BOS and return later this year :)",

        "review_text": "We had a good experience in the Air France lounge at CDG with good quality food and beverage. My husband had a nice shower prior boarding to freshen up after the ordeal of returning the car hire. BTW, please check the exact return location at CDG before driving there, as it's in terminal 1 and all international flights  depart from terminal 2, which requires a train transfer. An interesting observation of the flight was that all cabin crew were female on both legs. They were very polite, sweet and carried out their duties with charm and grace. I've fallen in love with the Dreamliner the first time I flew them on Royal Brunei a few years ago. The seats are so spacious and takes up the length of 3 windows! The monitor is large and the noise cancelling headphones are effective. The entertainment options were somewhat quite poor comparing to what Qantas and Cathay Pacific offer. The PA also is another area where they can improve on. I'm used to listening to Qantas, CX etc. cockpit crew more comprehensive announcement, and to struggle to hear a minimum need to know basis announcement was inadequate for me. Having said that, the food really made up for the shortcomings! This was by far the best Business class food we've had, and we have been flying BC on a few different airlines every year for the past 4-5 years. The Japanese menu offer, which I took came in a beautifully presented Bento box and everything was delicious! I would not normally eat twice when I fly, but I made an exception for this one after having read the menu. I was happy to wake up to the second offering, again from the Japanese menu. We also suffered minimal jet lag coming home, and I would attribute that to the Dreamliner environment, with extra amount of Oxygen, soft lighting and the light Japanese food. Will look forward to flying them again, perhaps on the direct route to and from Melbourne!",

The food is very good and there is plenty of it. The Flight Attendants leave out snacks and juice when they are having rests. The entertainment variety is not as good as other carriers but is adequate. I watched 5 films on the way out to Japan and on the way back I watched 5 films plus some short features about Japan. I had almost exhausted the film selection by then. The flight ran out of Diet Coke and they only gave a small plastic cup of drink at a time so make sure you take plenty of water on board. The crew are very friendly and helpful on board but the bag drop was very slow despite checking in online. One of the best airlines I have used but doesn't top 1 or 2 others.",

Was a bit of a hasdle having to pick up our luggages, clear immigration before heading to the domestic terminal. \n\nAnd I wish that the airlines website could be more user friendly. The look and feel seems a bit dated for a reputable airline.  \n\nFare was affordable and I managed to get a good price even though I booked my tickets quite last minute. \n\nNo doubt JAL is the best economy class airlines!",

        "review_text": "I travel often between USA and the Asia region and have had a few opportunities to take flight with JAL, member of the Oneworld Alliance. I purposely chose JAL over other air carriers serving between Tokyo-Narita Airport and Taipei Taoyuan Int\u2019l Airport due to the positive experiences I had on-board its flights. From the time I was at the check-in counter to the time I waited at the gate for boarding and the use of its airport lounge, I observed that everything was carried out in orderly fashions by its highly trained professional and courteous staff. There was hardly any rush or chaotic moments observed at the JAL boarding gate area. In one occasion I observed in ICN (Seoul), the JAL staff workers were waiting behind the check-in counter for the clock to strike 12 noon, the scheduled time to open. Immediately after the clock reached 12, they all stood up, bowed to the queued passengers first and then started serving them. I was very impressed how much staff workers take their jobs seriously. My experiences with their services on-board have been extremely pleasant as well. For each flight I had taken, whether I was sitting in the main cabin or in the business class cabin I was treated like a VIP. Flight attendants always use both hands to offer their service items and then bow and thank you before they move on to their next tasks. In some occasions the flight attendants even got down from their standing positions to talk to me while I was sitting. For paying attention to the details: they kept themselves very busy, offered service items and checked frequently for the comforts of each passenger on-board. They checked and cleaned up the lavatory after each passenger has used it. They folded and shaped beginning roll of toilet paper to pointed down triangle and prepared the facility for the next user. The choices of the foods served are always at the high standards and presentations are elegant and artful. In my own opinion: the levels of the customer services, the professionalism and the attention to details by JAL are almost flawless. There are many ways to run a good business; JAL certainly knows the most important element is not about how to make profits; but rather, about how to provide utmost services to the travelers who choose and trust the company. TripAdvisor\u2019s reviewers picked JAL as the 2017 Traveler\u2019s Choice Award for many good reasons; but most of all is its commitment to serve at the highest satisfaction level. It has earned customers\u2019 loyalty and reputations by ways of perfecting its services.  I salute to JAL for earning TripAdvisor\u2019s prestigious award and felt honored to have been served by its flight crew and ground crew several times in the past 7 months.",

        "review_text": "I've travelled this route many times with JAL but noticed that the service and hospitality has slipped..  They now employ Thai cabin crew who are not as well trained, gracious nor are they as attentive as the Japanese.  Many times I wished they'd pick up my meal tray so I could read/sleep or just move about. They did not make any special arrangements for our child.  No child's meals were offered (you have to pre-book them) nor was there anything given to the child to make her journey more interesting. (No colouring book and pencils).\nOn this flight, our entertainment system didn't work and my husband's tray wouldn't fold away. As the flight was full, he could not change seats. Poor maintenance.\nHaving travelled this route many times, I've been looking forward to a menu change.  It's always \"Japanese\" or \"Western\" but with very little choice in either style.  I crave a change!\nNevertheless, their flight schedule saved the day.  I've never known an airline to leave late yet manage to arrive early, every time!",

At the end of the flight, the flightstaff came and thanled each passenger for choosing JAL.\n\nTwo meals and a handful of snacks were very adequate and filling. The meals were served warm and fresh with a good assortment of dishes.\n\nThe flight entertainment system had recently been upgraded. A good selection of videos both new and classics,  games, tv, radio. There was a usb plug for charging and a few pockets to hold charging items.\n\nThe seats were comfortable enough. Good leg room and cushion.",

When she requested more she as it wasn't nearly enough she was told there was a shortage of milk which i found quite unbelievable. \n\nAlthough the majority of flight attendants were smiling and very helpful the senior attendants, noted by their brown jackets seemed jaded and completely disinterested and provided the bare basics when it came to customer service.  \n\nI must add that the check in was smooth and efficient.  Also the boarding procedure was just as smooth and efficient.  \n\nThe best part of the experience was the new dream liner.  It's a fine plane and the journey was quick and smooth.  \n\nThe return flight was the most disappointing aspect of our three week trip to Japan where we had amazng experiences in Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka.

        "review_text": "This airline is doing so many things right but for someone with a decidedly western palate, like myself and my kids, the food is just inedible. We had an overnight stopover in Narita en route to Helsinki.\n\nCheck-in on both outbound and return flights was very good. Staff were polite and efficient. Again on the plane, staff very friendly and efficient. I do wish they would have considered walking the isles offering coffee more than once - on all flights, the coffee was almost impossible to get.Other times it was only offered down one isle and not the other. Plenty of green tea on all flights though, so again, I am maybe a bit out of step with expectations.\n\nAs for the food, the first regular meal out of Australia was ok, the others on all the flights were almost impossible to eat. My kids have eaten the food on Thai but they refused this food. They were almost without food for the duration of two 10 hour flight and the same happened on the way back. Please drop the rice burger, it does not even sound like a good idea and, surprise..The vegetarian meal was also refused and when I tasted it, I must admit it was quite inedibly awful, I admit I didn't dare to taste everything on the vegetarian meal because it either looked or smelt foul.\n\nI tried to pick up some snack for the kids from the free basket they have on offer. How wrong can you go with potato chips, right. Well, they tasted dried fish.\n\nEntertainment system is reasonable and quite standard, better than Finnair but not as good as Emirates.\n\nI was once told my a professional in the airline industry to never expect anything from the entertainment system so to plan on something else and to bring my own food. Best advise ever.\n\nJAL does a good job of getting you from A to B and they have nice staff.\n\nThe overnight stop over worked out well. Staff ask you at check-in whether you require your bags for the stopover. Bus transfer is easy to find. Hotel check-in is quick. The only draw back is that all the three restaurants in the Marroad hotel have very japanese food (surprise!) and not of the kind easily identifiable by naive westerners. It maybe would have been ok if they could explain the menu but as nice and demonstrably helpful as they were, they did not speak a word of English between them. I was looking for japanese ramen/noodle/miso soups, japanese rice bowls of some kind, gyoza, sushi, sashimi. This left it very hard to satisfy three kids for dinner. I did still appreciate the stopover and the chance to sleep in a bed. Needless to say, we skipped breakfast. My nerves were just not ready to find out what we would get.\n\nI would fly JAL again but would then take some sandwiches. The overnight stopover and the full day return flight stopover makes it worth it. Japan is really such a nice place with the loveliest, most helpful people and they actually have very nice food as long as you can avoid anything that is not to your taste of course. The airport has a wonderful free stopover program with guides that will help you. Our guide really went over and above and made the stopover a really nice experience.",

Long story short, I work in South East Asia and travel back and forth from the States often. On my last trip back to America, my family and I used JAL/ Japan Airlines for our round trip tickets. They seem to have good reviews and ok prices, so my family gave them a shot. Everything went well on the trip to the States but on the return flight we had a family emergency that cause us to move our flight back one month. When I called JAL to see what the \"fee\" would be to move my flight, I was told that because of their policy, we would be charged almost the same amount as our round trip tickets! Of course our family didn't have the budget for that so I spent the week on the phone with their \"slow\" customer service team. After speaking to multiple managers, it became clear my best/cheapest option was to cancel our JAL tickets and only get our taxes back from the thousands we spent on the round trip. I was forced to book new one way tickets for my whole family, with a new airline company, just to get back to my job. I won't be using JAL again.",

We did both end up with aisle seats which we needed for 14 hour flight, but we were in the back of the plane. Other than that snafu would highly recommend JAL, the service was great!",

I did and don't regret it at all.  \nHaving flown nearly every major domestic airline I can confidently say that they are all a joke.\nFirst, the food.  The food they served me in economy is better than first class meals I've had flying domestically.  The food that was served on JAL was tasty and fresh.  It also looked good which is something that is hard to do.\nSecond, the service.  Attentive and pleasant.  \nThird, the flight attendants were all dressed impeccably and anyone that has flown on international airlines knows what I'm talking about.  US airlines can't compare.  \nFourth, the seats are more comfortable and even have footrests.  What the heck?  When was the last time domestic airlines thought about a small thing like that?  Oh, I forgot, they don't give a crap about their customers because they've got a captured market.\nFifth, no fee's.  Yup, domestic airlines continue to rip customers off with fee's but not JAL.  I think domestic airlines don't charge either for international flights but that's only because they probably wouldn't be able to complete if they did.\nSixth, I can't confirm but I swear they handle baggage with care.  Not a single ding on my suitcase.\nSeventh.  Cost.  About the same as it would have cost me to fly to the West Coast or Vegas.  I'd rather go to Japan.  No tipping (save 20%), food in general cheaper, and you won't find crappy food in Japan.  \nEighth.  Clean.  The entire plane was clean.  Even the bathrooms!\nThis was my first time to Japan but not my last.  I'll definitely consider JAL again, or ANA or Korean Air or pretty much any airline that isn't US based!!!",

The leg room is enormous; I could get out without disturbing the aisle passenger. Plenty of overhead bin space is available. This is important when sitting at the bulkhead. The seat was wide and comfortable.\nThe service was precise, polite and attentive, what you would expect in Japan. The food is good and nicely but efficiently presented. Teas and all other manner of drinks are offered throughout the flight.\nOverall a great travel experience and introduction to Japan.\nThe flight departed almost an hour late due to late arriving plane. We ended up landing within minutes of schedule so there effectively was no delay. I received an email and message a few hours before the flight informing me of the delay and apologizing. When I checked in for the flight, entered the Sakura lounge to wait, was waiting at the gate lounge and upon boarding announcement, apologies were given for the late departure. Once seated, the flight attendant addressed me by name to apologize for the delay. \nYes, the service is that good.",

Although I am reviewing based on a business class seat, I have tried enough business class seats to know that this was one of the best I have flied on. Before flying, they give you these eye masks and earplugs and they also have slippers on the seats which you can take home.\n\nLeg room: Perfect. It even has a little area off to the end of your foot, for those like me who don't want to put their bags on the carry on over head.\n\nSpace: This plane has a LOT of space. From little nooks to stick your phone while charging, to the little side cabinet you'll have where you can stick your bulky headphone case, or sleeping masks or whatever it is, as long as it's within 2kg, you're good.\n\nFood: Food is good. All through out, I ate the Japanese style, and my only problem there, is that I did not know that the wrapped cube was my rice. I thought it was dessert or something, and I was finished with my food before I knew that the wrapped thing was my rice.\n\nDrinks: They were very generous with drinks. I have been on flights where they don't give you a bottle of water, so you don't have to feel bad calling for them, whenever you're in the middle of the flight. They were abundant with coffee and tea as well.\n\nStaff: These ladies were SUPER helpful. My uncle's cane got stuck under the seat, and these 4 ladies were very helpful, to the point that they had to remove all of the seat's padding just to be able to reach under it.\n\nRestroom: Toothbrushes and mouthwash. I love these, since I forget to bring my own when I go to the restroom.\n\nMy only problem: Flight home from our layover (Tokyo - Manila) for some reason, the air condition was REALLY HOT. And I mean sweaty hot.\n\nBut overall, would recommend. Again, I am reviewing based on business class seats, do not take my word if you are flying economy.",

That leaves just a little more flight time before landing at 6:10p in Boston.  This is absolutely perfect as you're then tired by 10p Boston time - so that you can go to bed at a regular time.\n\nThough I definitely was a bit tired over the next few days, I never had the annoying issue of incessantly waking up at strange times once I was back.\n\nI highly recommend this flight - JAL has solved the jet lag problem, as far as I'm concerned!",

Boarding process was calm and very orderly.   Our B777-300 was almost brand new and immaculate.\nSeats were comfy and had lots of leg rooms.     Meals and snacks were pretty decent and crews make water and juice runs every 30 min or so to keep the passengers hydrated.     All in all excellent trip.    I think they are almost same level as ANA but ANA seems to have cabin crews that are a bit more cheery and enthusiastic.  North American carriers have a lot to learn from these high quality Asian Airlines.",

Boarding was a bit of a scrum with everyone diving at the gate once an announcement was made so no real separation for first/business. On board the cabin was very nice and secluded, it felt like we were the only ones on the plane which was great and the seat had a phenomenal amount of space. Service was very attentive throughout however only one of the cabin crew spoke English well enough to understand any questions which caused issues with the food for my wife. The bed was very comfortable (as was the seat) with lots of space and the TV screen was massive despite being quite a way from you (the bose full noise cancelling headphones were also excellent). The mattress was very comfortable but (with the pyjamas) made it quite hot as the cabin temperature was high on this flight so I didn't sleep that well due to being uncomfortable. Food and drinks offering for me were superb and I had the Japanese menu which was great, as well as a couple of the wines, sake and suntory 17 year old which I tried. My wife had issues with the food as we had call in advance to book her meal due to dietary requirements which had been noted (as the FA came and check with her at the start of the flight about them) but not taken into account (for example she can't eat fish which they acknowledged but then they brought out the starter of lobster), subsequently she didn't each much at all which was a shame. They also didn't have any flexibility to find food from another cabin that she could eat so we were disappointed with that part of the service (she had the same issues with breakfast). I tried the al a carte and had a couple of things which were nice and brought very quickly - the attentiveness of the staff is indeed good but their flexibility or ability to deal with anything non standard is not. I felt that like other airlines they should have more of the senior staff in this cabin rather than junior member (all senior were serving business on our flight). The arrival was very good and the flight overall was comfortable and the nice surroundings made the long flight time fly by. The pyjamas and amenity set by Porsche were very good. The snack bar (well I say bar, every time you got up to get anything from it the attendants dived up and got it for you!) was good. The best bit about the cabin is the exclusive part of it, on this flight it had 7/8 seats full but I felt as if i barely saw another passenger the whole flight, it was very quiet and nice and relaxing. Downside was the food for my wife who had fairly simple (not overly fussy) dietary requirements which, for the cost of the ticket I'd expect JAL to cater for especially as we called in advance to let them know.",

So I'll focus on what those minor points was ... because everything else really was excellent.\n\nCheck In at JFK\nDespite checking in online, the check in at JFK seemed a little chaotic, with the line snaking all the way back to the entrance when I arrived. There was no clear signage (or staff on hand to ask for assistance) in determining where the bag drop line was. So, I stood in line for at least 30+ minutes before deciding to break out of the line (at the risk of losing my place as I was traveling alone) to find a member of staff. The bag drop line was then pointed out to me (it was totally clear) - the signage had been blocked by fellow passengers standing in orderly single file (I guess my first exposure to the Japanese queueing). My bag was checked in and marked with a 'priority' label. \n\nThe Lounge(s)\nThis for me was the big benefit of traveling premium economy with JAL. You get full access to the lounge (Air France's lounge at JFK) and the JAL flagship lounge at Narita. At Narita I took a shower BEFORE boarding the 12 hour flight back NY, which felt really decadent.\n\nSeat\nThe JAL Sky Premium seat is excellent. This is a very well designed product. Fully adjustable footrest, power, holder for a full bottle of water, great seat slide, privacy screen, great width and lots of legroom. Comfortable enough for me to sleep both on the way to and from Tokyo. And the best thing about it, is that the seat in front does not recline into your space. I couldn't offer an improvement here.\n\nService (including F&B).\nThe in-cabin service was flawless, with ample food and beverage being served (or being made available throughout the flight) all of a very good standard. Where a minor point gets deducted is in that some passengers with totally Western palates may feel as though the options are limited. \n\nEntertainment\nThis was the only 'average' thing about the flight for me and is the only area that I felt was lacking. But the plus side was that a lack of great entertainment meant that I had no option but to sleep, and sleep in that great seat was easily forthcoming.\n\nI intend to travel back to Japan and this airline will definitely be my first choice for my return trip.",

Their Inflight Meal was very filling.  As for Entertainment, their Screens were fairly Big and the Choices were sufficient for the trip. As a Bonus, Japan Airlines offers 2 (23KG) Baggage Allowance vs. 1 (20-23kg) Baggage Allowance for Others.

When we arrived to await the JAL check in counter to open, the agents and their manager formally greeted the passengers in line, announced they were open, and thanked us for flying JAL with a bow. Was so humbling and grateful. Once checked in, we were taken to the JAL Lounge and the lounge was well set up with shower facilities, sandwiches, pastries, soups, salad, curry, rice, etc. In the back of the lounge they offered asian foods; dumplings, noodles, veggies, rice. Great assortment and choices. Drinks included juices, coffee, wine, beer, soft drinks. Variety of multiple language newspapers with a nice window view of the airplanes. When it was time to depart, the JAL agent came and drove us on the little \"golf cart\" to the gate. JAL had already reserved special seats in front of gate for wheelchair passengers. I've not seen this with other airlines. Once we pre-boarded, the plane was 788 and spacious. Offered slippers, warm cloth, First class kit, casual jacket to change into, newspaper/magazines, two meal services, snacks, movie/audio, and headsets. When your plane pulls from the gate to takeoff, the ground crew are lined up and all bow to the plane and wave! Choice of western or japanese meals on menu. Japanese meals were excellent presentation and delicious.My husband gave the staff several boxes of Hawaiian Chocolate Macadamia candy. Each of the flight attendants walked over and personally thanked us and in return a gift bag of Japanese snacks and personalize written thank you card! We were so relaxed and enjoyed our long flight. The restroom was spacious and provided toothbrushes and mouth wash.  JAL really know how to provide customer service and we will definitely be flying again.",

They even offered Miso Soup before every mealtime.\nI would definitely fly with them again.",

Instead of a dinner and snack prior to arrival, they served two full meals, both of which were tasty (remember - this is airline food at 33,000') and filling and plenty of alcohol was available .  We departed on time and landed on time - what more could you ask for these days.  In flight entertainment was \"meh\" and the lounge at SFO was less than stellar, although the lounge at Haneda was excellent.  Would not hesitate to flight Japan Airlines again.",

The numbers refer to the loooooooooong flight (13 hours) between Boston and Tokyo.  Premium economy seats are not much more than regular economy ($300 if you upgrade at the airport) and well worth it (though even the economy seats are pretty good since this route uses the gigantic dreamliner planes).  On this trip, you leave Boston at about 1pm; eat a big meal a couple of ours after takeoff, and either sleep or watch movies or work for the next 8-9 hours, then they feed you again, then you land in Tokyo.  A comfortable 2-3 hour layover and then on to Ho Chi Minh City.  You land at about 10pm HCMC time, by which time your system is mixed up enough and traveling has been tiring enough that going to bed when you get to your destination is just right.  JAL service is terrific; the flight crew is lovely.   I like the food a lot, especially the ice cream.  the Wifi is the best ever; I always use it for work and it's never failed me - totally unlike the lame gogo inflight nonsense on US domestic flights.",

I wanted to write a positive one for an airline which is exemplary.  \n\nI flew on the 787 Dreamliner from YVR to NRT in October, 2016 roundtrip.  The #1 sign that JAL actually cares about their passengers is they are one of only a handful of airlines that followed the recommended 2-4-2 seating arrangement in the 787 plane. Most airlines greedily have shoved in 3-3-3, making the cabin and aisles very cramped.  With the 2-4-2 it's really a nice in-airplane economy environment, especially combined with other Dreamliner features.\n\nMy only real complaint with this craft is that the space in front of you was quite small, and cramped, especially if the person reclined.  I know JAL has retro-fit a lot of their planes with a larger economy seat and legroom, so look to see if you can snag a route that has it if you fly them!) This plane wasn't updated just yet at the time, so personal space was a bit tight. \n\nThe food was really solid for airline food as they basically prepared you a little bento meal with real silverware and little plastic boxes for each food.  \n\nService was good.  Lots of extra tea/water/soup if you wanted throughout the flight.\n\nAnyway, if you're going to Asia, would absolutely recommend JAL.  One of the few airlines left that actually cares about their passengers from top to bottom.",

        "review_text": "After arriving at Haneda airport last April 2017, we cleared customs and immigration and rechecked our bags with JAL at the ground floor desk and were directed to another security checkpoint and then down to the ground where we caught an airport shuttle bus to the domestic terminal. We then had to get to the farthest gate away from the bus station (go figure..) and the plane to Misawa Japan eventually arrived and were boarded in less than 10 minutes. JAL does not fool around when boarding folks. Everyone gets on and sits down right away with a minimum or folks trying to put bags in the overhead compartments. In just a few minutes we were being pushed aaway from the gate and I watched the ground crew stand at attention and salute the pilots then wave at the passengers on the plane. Wow !!\nWe were in the air in no time. Arriving at Misawa was fun. Came in over the ocean to a one gate terminal on the Air Force Base @ Misaawa. Everyone deplaned in an orderly manner and in just a couple of minutes, were were off of the plane. Talk about efficient. \nOur bags came in to the carousel in less than 5 minutes and we were on our way to visit with family. \nReturning was even better. We checked in at the desk where there were 4 ladies working and our agent was able to give us boarding passes for the next flight but because of an equipment change in Tokyo, she could not do the boarding passes for that flight. \nWe went to the second floor and thru security in a breeze and sat down to wait. About 30 minutes later that same desk agent came up to me and said that she could now give us boarding passes for our remaining flights. Wow! She had come upstairs past security to find us at the gate and then took our passports and paperwork with her back down to her desk and returned about 10 minutes later with everything including the boarding passes. Holy Cow, that's just amazing. \nWe boarded again in less than 10 minutes and as usual everyone sits down right away and buckles up and in no time we're being pushed back from the gate. Again, the ground crew stood at attention - in the rain I might add - and saluted the pilots and waved at the passengers. I believe that the employees of JAL are really happy people and they must really love their jobs. Their smiles and attitude is infectious. \nWe took off quickly and landed at Haneda in Tokyo.\nAfter gathering our bags, we took the airport shuttle to the International terminal and had to pass thru security and immigration again and then we sat down to wait for our flight. This was a good time to get a bite to eat. There were lots of places to get food there. \nThe airplane that had been scheduled to fly to L.A. had a problem and they substituted an older model plane and it was just O.K. but not great. Every seat had a pillow and a blanket and headphones on it as we boarded. This flight was full. It was a \"Red Eye\" and I don't sleep on airplanes. Oh Well. \nService was excellent. The food seemed to be never ending. It was hot and tasty and the beverages (free) were easy to get when you asked for one. There were toothbrushes available in the bathroom in cellophane  so you could brush after eating. I've never seen that on any other flight I've ever taken. And again as usual, all of the crew were smiling and seemed to be very happy. \nSo other than the less than super airplane on the flight from Tokyo to L.A., JAL was tops. I'd fly with them again in a heartbeat. I actually booked my entire flight thru JAL and they code shared with American Airlines for portions of it. PHX to LAX and then LAX to Tokyo and then from San Francisco to Phoenix. Everything else was on JAL.",

        "review_text": "This was our first (and long overdue) really long-haul flight, so we wanted to have the best chance for comfort.  Hence, we used awards to get two F class seats, and we are glad that we did!\n\nThus, our experience is only with the First Class experience, but we expect to use Business class in the future.\n\nOne very special \"touch\" was that the Flight Attendants appeared to clean the restroom after every use.  In one case, one of us went to use the toilet, and someone else had just left... and a Flight Attendant hurried over and asked that we wait a moment while she cleaned up.\nNeedless to say, this was THE cleanest airline bathroom ever.  It was probably the cleanest bathroom we've ever encountered in a public/semi-public space.  And airline bathrooms/toilets are generally not known for their ongoing, uh, cleanliness as the flight continues...\nYes, F class has a lot of advantages, but we wouldn't fly F without using awards, given the cash price.\n\nWe had read that the shared F lounge at JFK left much to be desired, and that was definitely true.  (We haven't flown JAL outbound from Japan - we used CX - so we can't speak for any F lounge in Japan.)\n\nThe food was quite good.  The Flight Attendants kindly arranged for us to share (using the companion seat) a \"noodle tasting\" with the 3 types of noodles.  They also spent a bit of time helping to teach DH how to use chopsticks a bit better.  Nice \"extra\" ;-)\n\nThe F seats/beds were great, and that was a huge reason we chose F class, in an attempt to get some sleep on such a long flight.  When we were younger, we could have slept almost anywhere, but... no more...\n(We flew out of Japan via Hong Kong on Cathay, as we wanted to compare the two F class products.  CX definitely has the more comfortable seats/beds, especially with the nice width.  Otherwise, both F classes provided a remarkably nice way to travel long haul.  And without awards, the price would have been commensurately high.  We'll continue to save our awards for F class!)",

They staff and crew member were all courteous, polite, helpful, and so respectful. A special mention to the crew of JL723/03JUN. From the moment I stepped in there was not a moment that the crew did not smile. Every passenger was treated equally regardless of your nationality or class of travel. Throughout the 7 hour flight, the crew were always visible, vigilant and ready to attend to your requests. The one thing that makes the JL crew stand out from the rest was the fact that their service was genuine and it definitely came from the heart. They actually loved doing their job, This I must say, is a very rare sight on any airline. The crew represented their nation, their culture and their airline very well. It represents a truly warm Japanese Hospitality. The seats on the 787 were comfortable. Food choice was also far better than any other economy class selection. The inflight entertainment was awesome. the crew also spoke English well enough for anyone to understand. I have no complaints but instead I have nothing but praises for this airline.  Its my first time on JL and will definitely not be my last. This airline is highly recommended especially if you are travelling with children and elderly passengers.

After 45 minutes of discussion with supervisor of supervisor, they finally said we could change to a direct flight to LA from Haneda at a cost of $200/pp.  We said no and requested reimbursement of bus transfer costs but they refused.  Will be writing to company.

I was on Japan Airlines for the legs from Vancouver, CA to Narita, Japan and then on to Ho Chi Minh.  \n\nService on the planes was amazing!  On the tarmac in Narita, takeoff was delayed by a thunderstorm.  The attendants were reassuring and very present in the business cabin.  Reading materials and water was offered to everyone.  The actual flight was great with wonderful food and comfortable sleeping conditions.\n\nThe problem I had was with gate agents in Narita.  Before boarding, a gate agent approached me and told me she was checking my bag.  I only had a small carry on bag.  My handbag and computer were inside of my carry on.  I asked her why she was checking my bag.  She kept asking me if I agreed with her checking it.  I said I would comply if it was required but I just wanted to know why.  I looked over at the people lined up in the business class line and they all had between 2 and 5 bags with them (yes, 1 guy had 5 including a laptop bag, portfolio, suitcase, over the shoulder bag and shopping bag).  Why was I being asked to check?\n\nAnother gate agent came over and asked to see my ticket.  She then told the gate agent who had been trying to check my bag that I was in business class.  The original agent replied that she had already asked for my bag.  The other woman walked away.  So I took my bag, laid it on the floor, opened it and took out my handbag and medicine.  She put the checked ticket on the bag and reassured me it would be prioritized to come out first in Vietnam.  She then took the bag away.  I lined up to get on the plane, clutching my med bag and handbag like a character from the Beverly Hillbillies.\n\nOn the plane, business class was less than 1/2 full.  I was in a row of 6 seats (2, 2, 2) with only 2 people in the row.  There were no bags in the bins over my head.  After I was seated, another woman boarded.  She was in the row behind me and had no bags.  I asked her about it and she said the gate agents took her bag.  We were the only 2 women in business class that night.  I don't know if that was the reason our bags were taken but I did think it.  \n\nWhen I got to Ho Chi Minh, my bag came out last, despite the agent telling me it would be priortized to come out first.  I was thankful that I got my bag and for the wonderful in flight service.",

        "review_text": "We travelled on JAL in April 2017 from London Heathrow to Tokyo Haneda and back.\nI booked tickets via expedia as there were some problems with the JAL website in July 2016.  We called JAL to choose seats and special meals, which were all confirmed by telephone and documented by myself.  I tried to call JAL several times before we were due to depart but I could not get through on the phone.  Upon check in at Heathrow it became apparent that our seats were not those we had been promised and our special meals had not been prepared.  We were not pleased with this additional stress on a 12 hour flight.  The staff member at Heathrow was very apologetic and wasn't sure why the problem had occurred.  In the end our seats (6 travellers) were still together so this was not a problem, but our meals would be standard which we did not want.  We were given \u00a350 cash to spend in duty free for meal replacements to take on the plane, they were very apologetic about the error.\nThe lady who helped us, made sure that our meals (halal) for our return flight were booked correctly.\n\nBoarding was straight forward.  We could board with priority due to having children with us which helped a lot.\nWe were sat in rows 25 and 26 A, B and C which were reasonably close to the toilets, without being too close that we would be disturbed.  We also seemed to have an extra overhead storage compartment due to the way the seats were in that section of cabin.\nLeg room is generous in economy class on JAL with their SKY wider seats.  I am 5'8\" so was comfortable with leg room.\nThe seats are reasonably comfortable, perhaps slightly on the hard side for a 12 hour flight.\nEntertainment selection was very good in terms of international films and language options.\nMeals were served in good portions in my opinion, plus I had the benefit of eating my childrens left overs haha!  On the way out, luckily the regular meals had a fish option that we could eat which was very fortunate, as I was not looking forward to cold sandwiches the whole flight.\nWe packed plenty of snacks too, so we didn't ever feel too hungry.\n\nI found it very hard to sleep on the flight as I simply couldn't get comfortable, with having little legs strewn across my lap, and not wanting to move for fear of waking the little one.  All our fellow passengers were well mannered and there were no disruptions.  \nUpon arriving at Haneda we were greeted by a member of staff with my husbands name on a placard.  She wanted to apologise for the problems with our meals.  We thought this was a wonderful touch from JAL and it was much appreciated.\n\nThe return flight was pretty much the same as the journey out, except this time we had our halal meals as promised.\nWe would certainly fly with JAL again.",

My 7 yo loved all her food, as it was presented beautifully!  There was so much food she gave her food to her 12 yo brother, who preferred the children's meals, go figure.

The only downside was that my son was not fond of the food that they served.  He just ate bread with butter and the ice cream that was served as dessert.  Good thing that I didn't choose a direct flight knowing that my son might get bored in the plane.  During our lay over, that was the time that he ate.  What I loved about their service was how concerned the flight attendants were when they see that my son wouldn't eat.  They would always check on him.\n\nOur plane from MNL to JAP had a bigger leg room, which unfortunately wasn't the same from JAP to CAN.  Going back, we were lucky that we were seated right behind the Business class area since it had a bigger legroom.  I also noticed that their lavatories (i forgot what route it was) were more spacious.",

Wonderful polite and helpful staff, and even the ground crews bow when you depart and arrive, good manner still exist here, one of the last places on earth! JAL leave on time, tell you how long to departure and are very clear about boarding procedures, all too often a sharp contrast to Australian airlines. One of my favourite airlines.",

They have slippers/eye masks/toothbrushes/blankets/pillows/gaming/delicious food/eye refreshener/hot towels/alcohol/hot tea and on and on and on. The attendants are top notch and very helpful. in every way The plane is so very clean. There is a plethora of shows/movies/games and etc to view while on a long flight. The lounges are fantastic as well filled with delicious food, drinks and alcohol. They were so great with our luggage.  The restrooms were always clean. The staff for JAL is so helpful that even when they are not on the plane they assisted us. It is completely service oriented.  Any chance I get, I will take JAL and I will certainly recommend JAL to anyone.",

Neither flight was 100% full and crew were attentively moving passengers once boarded to ensure everyone had a spare seat next to them that wanted (very thoughtful!).",

It's not an offensive colour but it does make the cabin look a tad dated.\n\nI didn't find the seat anything like as comfortable as BA's equivalent, which I find to be one of the best. It's not awful but I found towards the end of the flight, it felt a little firm. I'm also not a fan of the vinyl material they use for the seat covering. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't have liked to see leather seats but I think a fabric covered seat is better for a long flight.\n\nThe's a lot of space around the seat and loads of cubby holes to keep your stuff in. They also give you very nice amenities, which are much better than on other airlines. Additionally, you can relax in a the Porsche Design PJs they give you.\n\nSleep comfort was good and the cabin temperature was ok but perhaps verging on the side of being too warm. A choice of mattress topper is offered (firm or soft) which is a nice touch, although I found the pillows to be much too soft.\n\nFood was average, wine excellent. I'm vegan, so I'm used to being disappointed by airline food and this was no different. I don't know why the fancy chefs these airlines hire for their premium cabins can't come up with some more creative vegan offerings.\n\nBest part was the service, which was simply outstanding. The crew were very friendly always immediately on hand to help.They really couldn't do enough and anticipated my every whim. I think it was probably the best service I've experienced in the air, rivalling even CX, who I rate pretty highly.\n\nOverall, a very pleasant flight. If the seat was a little better, it would be up there with the very best.",

A large TV screen in the seat back offers many entertainment choices including recent Hollywood movies, etc.  The food was delicious too; although I feel they could've put less rice and more food in the main dish.  But I understand that rice is the \"main dish\" for Japanese so that's how it goes.  The restrooms are kept very clean throughout the flight.  They also provide disposable tooth brush for you convenience.  I think on JAL flights most of the passengers are Japanese and they tend to be more polite and quieter so you will enjoy the flights even better.  I will definitely fly JAL again!",

Not expecting they would drag people of the plane here, ever!  Quite the opposite!!\n\nWe also had a child with us and had requested a kids meal for the flight.  This was honored without even having to ask the attendants.  As we boarded, the attendants had my son's information and had confirmed the request.  He was served his meal before the general distribution.   Really helpful when traveling with a young child.  The adult meals served were good.  Had a selection of two meat options.  Bonus was the Haggen Dazs ice cream served after one of meals.  Passengers are able to go to the mid or rear of plane to get snacks, if the choose.  Assortment of chocolate, cookies, and crackers available.\n\nEntertainment available on the flight was great.  A great mix of current and relatively recent movies.  Also had option to customize audio, monitor flight plan maps, play games and purchase merchandise.  \n\nRestroom facilities were clean.  Assuming the attendants perform a sweep through every so often as the toilet rolls were always full and folded in a point.  Also, didn't smell bad from over usage with a 12+ hour flight.\n\nThe planes arrived and left on time throughout our various legs to final destination.  Now I'm spoilt and will be expecting this level of service from U.S. carriers.",

        "review_text": "As typical of Japanese service, check-in and boarding was efficient and courteous. The sky-wider seats in economy were the best of any airline I have ever experienced, with more leg room than needed and a wider seat. Also loved the folding headrests to nestle my head with neck-styled pillow. Although I used the pillow and blanket as lumbar and bottom rests as the seats can be deemed a bit thin on cushioning after 10 plus hours. The inflight entertainment was on one largest screens I have ever experienced including premium economy on other airlines with a nice selection of movies from Hollywood and beyond.\n\nMeal service was pleasant, with a snack of rice crackers and drink of your choice of beverage (sodas, juices, beer and liquor). Dinner was served about 2 hours into the flight with choice of fish or chicken, minimally Westernized Japanese entrees. It came with 4 sides of a soba, salad, seaweed salad, and a fruit mix, all very high quality and crafted with care (unlike those of American based airlines, this was on par with meals of BA and AF from Europe). Choice of beverage including wine was served with dinner. As usual with Trans-Pacific Asian airlines Haagen Daz was provided shortly after dinner. After lights out, was self serve snacks and drinks by the galley, this included juices/water, various crackers, cookies, chocolates and candies. Toothbrushes are available in the restrooms midway through the flight for those wanting to freshen up before breakfast. The last meal consisted of a warm pasta salad, yogurt and fruit. Overall the flight was very well serviced including flight attendants walking throughout the duration of the flight checking on any customer needs.\n\nWhat happened next was extraordinary and confirmed what I believe to be outstanding of Japanese service/culture. While deplaning in HND, we had left a small cloth satchel containing cosmetics, chocolate and a toothbrush, we did not realize this until we were settled in our hotel a few hours later. We naturally assumed it would be disposed of along with all the other things that people leave on board airplanes so they could get it turned around for the next flight. Fast forward 6 days during our check-in from HND - SFO. After we were handed our boarding passes, we asked by chance if they found our satchel on the plane from a flight a week ago, after a brief description and confirmation of our previous flight information, the agent said someone would be out with it in 5 minutes. WOW and in 5 minutes??? While waiting I walked by the money changer and notice a JAL employee burst our a door running by with the satchel we misplaced earlier. Much to my wife's delight she go her bag back. This is very Japanese, where honor and customer service are of the upmost importance executed with respect, efficiency and grace.

On the plane it clearly is available and with my back injury (demonstrated to the flight crew with photographs and my obviously swollen feet) was told \" So Sorry\" by Chief Cabin Attendant Kyoko Ono after my offer to purchase this on the plane, Not sure is this is stupidity, racism (Japan's history) or insensitivity to handicapped people. I have requested a call from their management twice now and have got nothing back so far. If not today this gets posted in my LinkedIn profile with ove 1,000 contacts that travel extensively.Good service from JAL over the years are erased by this blunder, his flight commemorated my 1,000,000th miles actually flown for business on their Partner American Airlines, This is a good chunk of my 4,500,000 actual flown miles with various carriers over my 40 year career span. Still awaiting a call from JAL or American Airlines,,,\n\nIt's now been over 2 weeks and I'm STILL WAITING to hear back from JAL Management. yesterday I sent a message to management  through their customer service contacts (very weak trained) that said I must wait without any commitment on a due date for their response, This is to be considered my official notice that the due date is May 1st (AKA Mayday : Universalr Term for Distress) by 12 noon Cebu City , Philippines time or before for appropriate apologies and financial consideration. If someone has contact info on the firm handling the United Airlines Fiasco, please share this in case I need to take action I sincerely do not want to take. My preference is to update and remove my Facebook post yet they drag their feet and show further disrespect towards white people and handicapped Americans,This will now go on LinkedIn with the same sincere request for professional resolution...

Compare that to the ~17 inch wide seats on the same plane on American Airlines with only ~31 inches of pitch. The food was also very tasty and dessert was Haagen Dazs ice cream! In terms of inflight entertainment, each economy seat had a pretty big screen on the back of the seat containing a good selection of movies and TV shows in both Japanese and English. There probably could have been more Hollywood blockbusters included, by that's just nitpicking on details. Overall, it was a great flight.",

The entertainment panel and the programmes were \nbehind the the newer competitors - fundamentally old.\nAnother old positive is the Japanese service which was good. But the linguistic skill of the announcers were similarly like before. English pronunciation remains old Japanese standard.

The seats are 18.5\" (compared to 18\" for domestic flights) wide and have an extra 4\" of legroom (due to increase pitch and a slimmer seat design).

Japan hospitality is the best compared to Australian airlines.\n\nOn top of great service you can check in twice as much as most airlines.\n\nAt Narita airport I had a connecting flight to Osaka, however the staff realised for me that I actually needed to be at Haneda airport! Quite a shock for me, but the check in lady took me to the correct bus counter in the airport to get to Haneda. She even knew when the bus was leaving. Good luck getting that service from Australian airlines.\n\nSmall tip: if you plan to buy a data SIM card in Japan for your photo, you can do buy it from the flight attendants during your flight  (check the on-flight shopping section on the entertainment system). It's cheaper than buying at the airport.\n\nFlying domestic from Tokyo to Osaka is also a pleasure. I was really worried I might miss my flight as I had to bus it between the two Tokyo airports, but in Japan you can check in with less than 30 minutes from flight departure. Again good luck checking in on an Aussie airline with less than 60 minutes before the flight.\n\nIf you are flying to Japan, JAL should be your top choice.",

It beat every domestic airline I have been  \n   on in the U.S.  \n   I see they made the top ten airlines in the world on tripadvisor, after my flight.  I did  \n   not see ANA like I read other reviews for.\n\n  I did like row 26 in front of the bathrooms.  Behind us was a crew storage I believe.  I could put my seat back without feeling offensive.  No extra noise or smell.  It fact most foreign travelers did not get up but usually once on the 13 hour flight.  I got up 7 or 8 times.  I'm not a well sitting person.  \n\n  Smooth flight and landings were without any bump on the runway.  That impressed me.  I liked the crew before boarding, looking at the travelers and bowing and smiling at them, then turning to man the aircraft.  I felt comfortable as I am usually stressed before any flight anywhere.  \n\nI would recommend this airline to a friend and take it again myself.",

I boarded in Narita, and thought I might want to sleep part of this leg, as I was exhausted. But I'd see how the flight went. (I generally wouldn't have, but the first leg of the flight from LAX to NRT was brutal. In business class, but the seats in front of me had passengers who insisted on talking to each other across the aisle, the person behind me insisted on using my backrest as a leaning device every time he got up, and there was a screaming child three rows over. I couldn't sleep but a half hour all the way across the Pacific.)\n\nI wasn't sure I wanted a middle seat on this flight, but I was assured I was the only one in the middle seat. When I boarded the plane and saw that seat? Oh my! Little tables on both sides of me, the lay flat seat in the middle, fully featured set up in front of me (power outlet, pull out drawers and ledges, screen, etc). I settled in and...\n\nI think I was asleep before we were even 15 minutes into the flight. I missed meal service, but didn't really \"miss\" it. I think I woke up once, and headed to the lavatory, and when I got back to my seat, the \"flight angels\" had fluffed my pillow, reset my duvet, rearranged my slippers... and vanished. I never heard a single sound the entire flight but the light whisper of the flight attendant's skirts and they whisked past down the aisle. The other passengers? The most polite passengers I've ever seen on any flight anywhere (and remember, this was just coming off of a flight with some of the loudest and rudest passengers, so oh my gosh, heaven!). A full seven hours of utter silence. I didn't even really know there was anyone there, unless I pulled a \"gopher\" and popped my head up over my little seating area.\n\nAbsolutely the best service anywhere. Bottles of water were replaced before they were 1/4 empty, and I had two bottles put into my hands before I left the plane. Most polite flight attendants anywhere. And the bit of food I ate was truly lovely! I felt like I was in first class, I think the only thing missing was a shower and bathrobe!",

On the way back we had a stopover in Tokyo and I guess JAL would have a lot of business class passengers and didn't offer the fast track service.\nPlane was a bit worn and not the new planes they've been operating eith previously.\nWas expecting the Japanese food offering to be better and although the presentation was good overall quite bland and was slightly disappointed on the quality. Steak on the way back was wonderful though not enough in my opinion. Wife didn't even want to share her steak, as I had the Japanese option.",

        "review_text": "Caution!\n\nI purchased 2 tickets (for me and girlfriend) to fly from New York to Tokyo on one of their 787 Dreamliners.  We were extremely excited about flying on a Dreamliner.  It was a big reason why we chose to fly on JAL.  We elected to stick with economy seating because the 2-4-2 configuration allowed us to have a section to ourselves, with no middle seat.  \n\nBefore our trip, however, the airline made two unilateral changes:\n\n1)  Delayed the flight to Tokyo by 2 hours, which impacted our plans upon arrival.  They called to tell us this, yet made no mention of a plane change or moving our seats; and\n\n2) With zero notice, the airplane swapped out the advertised Dreamliner to an older model with 3-3-3 economy seating.  Additionally, they separated the two of us on the 14-hour flight, and we no longer are seated next to each other.  The flight is fully booked, so we were stuck.\n\nOverall, we are extremely disappointed and frustrated with JAL, and would advise caution when booking with them.  JAL advertised a certain plane and seating chart, plus specific flight times, then after they received our money, switched us to a worse plane, moved our seats apart, and shortened our vacation.\n\nAs others have noted, JAL's customer service is awful.  They don't even pretend to care, and make no effort to address travel issues they have created.  We made phone calls and emailed customer service.  The only option they offered us was to cancel our flight just weeks before we were scheduled to depart, when other airlines are booked or super expensive.\n\nAnyways, if you are going to purchase tickets on JAL, be prepared for disappointment.",

The AA plane going from LAX to Tokyo had an actual plug so I could plug my Kindle in [not a USB port but they had that as well] so I was able to read up until the time we landed. The return trip [JAL} had the USB port but I had about 3 hours left and my Kindle ran out. Otherwise, the food was good and the staff extremely accommodating.

JAL is also one of the very few airlines providing pyjamas for a 7-hour day-flight, it was a nice touch. However, compared to few months ago, they didn't provide the face masks and eye masks for the passengers this round.\n\nThe monitor is of HD quality, and the earphone is great.

I was amazed at the food, comfort and best of all, service through out the flight. My economy class seat felt like first class. \n  Now, to the staff at Narita on my return trip to Boston. Because of delays and traffic conditions we were arriving extremely late to the airport. We called ahead and informed JAL of our situation and they told us they would do everything possible to get us on the plane. When arriving I was sure there was no possible way I would make the flight. Arriving at the desk with two large bags to check in the staff quickly sprang into action checking the bags and expediting my way through security to the plane where I made my flight. I salute the employees at Narita airport and throughout the company for being the pinnacle of airline service and professionalism. JAL will be my first choice wherever I go. Thank you",

This caused a misunderstanding, (later overcome) about usage of the Business Class lounge at CTS, and no application of Priority labels for luggage that we had to pick up and transfer to the bus for Narita. The answer is one should check in at JAL Global counter, (as there is no Business Class counter at CTS for domestic flights).

Seat folded flat into a comfy bed with an additional pad available and a fluffy comforter. The flight attendants were impeccably dressed, neat and extremely polite. They were very attentive without being intrusive. Whenserving they even wore aprons with the BB-8 robot on them...it was so cool. The food and snacks were varied, very plentiful and delicious. Breakfast choices included either a traditional Japanese breakfast or a traditional American breakfast. Will fly them again!",

This was our first international flight in First (as opposed to business) class and the difference was very noticeable, both in terms of service and seat quality. The privacy afforded by the seats on the 777-300ER we were fortunate enough to occupy was lovely. Most of the time one could relax and imagine there was no-one else nearby. Until, that is, one wanted a drink refill or something to eat, when the staff would immediately appear.\nI was mildly annoyed by the fact that our party of 4, including 2 young children, were not seated together on the return flight, instead seated at the four corners of the 8 seat cabin. I was concerned that our children would not be able to remain quiet without a parent seated next to them (something the airline had been helpful in arranging on the initial flight) and that I would need to apologise to other passengers for noise or crying. Fortunately, as the flight was a night one, they slept nearly the whole flight (a testament to the comfort of the beds!), but I was rather surprised that the airline would not have grouped us together, given that our booking was made 10 moths in advance and the ages of the children clearly noted.",

I cannot even begin to tell you how much better this airline was to fly. First off, their coach seats are as roomy as extended leg room upgrades on American...maybe bigger. And you don't have to pay more! That alone makes me respect them, because they treat people like human beings instead of sardines! \n\n The video screens were on then back of the seats, and they were a nice size, more like an iPad rather than a large phone like on American. Plus, there are little stretchy pockets on the back of the seat where you can put your glasses or a water bottle or whatever you want to easily keep within reach. SUPER convenient, and smartly planned. \n\nThe food was amazing. I was stunned, actually. They kept us well fed throughout the flight. And the flight attendants are incredibly sweet and attentive. \n\nI actually enjoyed our super long flight.  We are going to Indonesia in October and planned our trip in such a manner that we will be flying with Japan Airlines the whole way, even though we are American Airlines mileage members. We got lucky that we could use Japan Airlines for the whole trip! I'm actually excited to fly because of this great airline.

I didn't get this much room paying extra on AA and I never did on United because the upgrade to \"economy plus\" price is ridiculous.  \n\nEach seat in economy had its own power port and USB port to keep you electronic device going.  There was a larger than average screen to watch movies that you could start or resume at any time.  The food was good and beer and wine were free.\nJAL has made the 12 hour economy flight bearable.  I'll shop with JAL right from the start next time and forego any of my AA miles because they only gave me half on a codeshare anyway.",

JAL's airplane was clean, comfortable and thoroughly enjoyable. JAL also included slippers at no extra charge.I would rate them #1 - outstanding!!",

        "review_text": "Pleasant enough flight.....and the flight attendants are outstanding.  There is a discernable different between how these flight attendants treat passengers in coach versus what most other (and especially US based airlines) flight attendants do.  Lots of smiles, very polite, very respectful.  A breath of fresh air.  However, there are some distinct drawbacks to JAL.\n\n1) In certain lower cost fare classes, you cannot secure a seat assignment until, generally, 72 hours before departure.  This is annoying.  Then, to secure the seat assignment, online, you need to know the JAL booking reference code.  Therefore, if you book a JAL segment through a travel agent or through another partner airlines, call that provider and get the JAL booking code - and it will be different from the partner airline's code.\n\n2) The legroom is significantly less (I'm guessing 6 inches less) than say AA's economy \"extra.\"  For short hauls, okay - for long haul's it would be torture.\n\n3)No frequent flyer miles, for example, for most economy fares in the AA frequent flyer program - even though JAL is a partner airline.\n\n4) Finally - announcements are NON-ENDING and say the same thing time and time again.  Very hard to watch a movie in JAL with all there interruptions.  Having said that, their selection of entertainment options is quite good.",

We had really good memories of the last few times that we flew JAL on pacific crossing flights. This time around, it wasn't as good. The service was good, but the food has fallen a little from our previous flights, though they still serve hot udon soup, which I enjoyed. The seats, however, were not lay-flat (it was my fault for not checking the plane before booking, as I expected all pacific crossing flights.) On the other hand, the angle-flat seats were still better than AA's angle flat seats on those flights from LAX to PVG.  We don't recommend this flight unless JAL changes the configuration on its planes; alternatively you should look into flights from LAX to Narita instead.  One good thing about flying JAL instead of AA out of LAX is that as Executive Platinum member of AA, we have access to the Qanta's first class lounge, which is probably the best lounge that I have ever used.  Had we flew AA, then we will be out of terminal 4 and only have access to AA's Admiral Flagship lounge, which is not nearly as good as the Qanta's lounge.",

I was slightly disappointed with the seat arrangement in business class...but found the seat to be rather comfortable, nonetheless.\n\nJAL has two versions of the Boeing 787...the larger one has the JAL suite in business class that comes with a more private fully lie-flat seat (flies to Narita Tokyo from LAX).  I flew on the smaller version from LAX to Kansai airport in Osaka).  The seat appears to be the older type business class seat in 2-2-2 arrangement and has an angle lie flat seat.\n\nAs expected of any Japanese airlines, the service was spectacular.  The stewardess are very attentive and courteous.  Prior to takeoff, the chief stewardess goes to each passenger and introduces herself.  She does the same at the end of the flight asking for any suggestions or comments.  They are always cheerful and seem to really enjoy their job.\n\nThe food is spectacular.  They offer both Japanese style and Western style food.  I can't say anything about the western style, as I ordered Japanese style on both trips.  Food is tasty, and they give you ample amount of it.\n\nThe seats were comfortable.  But as most airlines now offer lie-flat seats in Business class, I was surprised that JAL didn't do that for all their airplanes.  But the seat was comfortable enough.  good thing was that the flight was not full, so the stewardess changed my seat to a row all to myself.  Hence, I got a window seat, and I didn't have to jump over another person to get to the aisle.",

The seats were comfortable, personal entertainment options plentiful, and many amenities provided. The flight attendants provided professional yet friendly service for the duration of the flight.  \n\nSince neither of us eats meat, we ordered a vegetarian meal, normally of good to excellent quality on every international flight we've ever flown. In this case however, the food quality ranged from poor to positively inedible! On our flight to Tokyo our main meal consisted of curly egg noodles with a tablespoon of thin tomato sauce while on the return flight we were served rice, a TVP \"burger\" with a speck of ketchup that was as rubbery and tasteless as it appeared (it was returned uneaten). \n\nOverall, the flight was very good and while we had no complaints except for the food, we were quite surprised at just how bad it was! If we fly JAL again we'll remember to bring along a plentiful supply of our own food!",

Everything was smooth. It is so amazing and convenient that you don't need to check in or get a boarding pass when boarding JAL's domestic flights!\n\nWhen we entered the cabin, I found JAL was providing the cover bags for passengers to wrap their carry-on baggage. It is such great Japanese hospitality! Every time when I fly with other airlines, I try not to put my bag on the floor to avoid getting dirty.\n\nOur seats were at the economy class section. All seats are leather seats and clean. The legroom is wide enough even I put my bag under the front seat.\n\nDuring the flight, free drink was offered. We liked to try something special, so I chose \"cosome soup\" while my husband picked their original juice \"SKYTIME\". Not bad choices.\n\nAs the flight time was quite short, we didn't try to sleep. My husband read the in-flight magazine. I was excited to try their free in-flight Wi-Fi! On the day before, I found on JAL's website that they are offering Wi-Fi for free on domestic flights. I registered the Gogo account before the flight as the website suggests.\n\nIt was so easy to get connected than I imagined. The speed was fine. I just browsed some recommendations on restaurants in Okayama.\n\nThe flight landed smoothly and on time. The weather in Okayama was nice!\nIt was really an enjoyable trip with JAL.",

My seat has a leg rest and it reclines, leather seat, my own lamp, a couple of chargers and outlet. The seat is spacious and I still have the space to place my jacket, headphone and neckrest. The temperature inside the plane was warm. No blanket needed.  Bathroom is relatively wider than the other airlines that I had taken. The airline offers toothbrush, toothpaste, and slippers.  This is the cleanest airline bathroom that I had seen even though it was used by a lot of passengers.\n\nThe food was okay but I wish the airline would offer ramen and tofu (ha!).  For a premium seat, I was offered wine before and during meal.  It was a good wine, though. \n\nThe only thing that I did not like was, the plane that flew us from Manila to LAX was an American Airlines.  I know that they are partner airlines but I wish it will be JAL again.  Tickets are not cheap though but I wish the airline will offer a one day tour of Japan.

(See the pic I posted) Ask for the \"window stickers\" to black out the windows- they do exist- there aren't any actual pull down window shades otherwise. Only window dimmers. \n\nFood- wonderful! Watch out for shellfish if you have an allergy. Scallops and lobster in several meals in both the Japanese and American meals. \n\nThe Japanese noodles with seaweed are pretty good- a bit salty from the seaweed but if you want to try your 1st noodles now's the time and juts push the seaweed to the side if you aren't up for the green slime! :)\n\nThe chocolates are divine.",

This time I had the opportunity to fly on JAL's new Dreamliner plane on my own from NY to Tokyo business class. \nThe plane was magnificent in its internal set up in that despite the seating arrangement in business class in pairs the arrangement was such that the seats were set with a slide up screen between each pair of seats, thus providing you with your own private area.\nInitially you were provided with a pillow, larger than the standard pillow provided, and a light weight cotton doing. The seats lay completely flat and you were provided with a mattress to put over the seating once you were at a particular height so you could go to sleep.\nEach individual unit had all of the standard business class goodies - remote control TV with a multiplicity of channels, comfortable headphones, your own personal lighting system so as not to disturb others. \nThe menu provided was amazing, allowing you to provide from Japanese or Western style menu.  You could order when and what you wanted from the menu at any time during the flight.  At no particular time were you required to eat, but at the mere press of the attendant button you could order food or drinks, which were extensive, at will. \nThe staff, right from the moment you joined the check in queue to those who farewelled you at the other end were amazing.  Nothing was too much trouble for them and you were never left to feel like your request was too much to ask for or unnecessary and were answered promptly and graciously.  \nAll in all the airline and its staff were absolutely wonderful.",

        "review_text": "I have flown on many airlines all over the world and have experienced business and premium classes on some of the finest, but JAL has eclipsed all of them! The cabin, restrooms, and personal space were all immaculate and restful with attention to such details as to make a very long flight feel relaxed and brief. A supplemental mattress for sleep and earphones that actually cancelled out noise and allowed me to hear the films clearly, were just two of the welcome appointments. \n\nThe meals were of gourmet quality. I chose the Japanese menu, and found it varied, delicious and completely satiating -- almost a part of the entertainment system as I explored the diverse offerings. The two brands of sake offered were both of top quality and nicely complemented the repast. \n\nBut by far, the best part of the trip was the hospitality offered by the gracious flight attendants from the moment I boarded to the time I almost reluctantly disembarked. Though all were faultless, I must single out one. Okubo was absolutely splendid and went above and beyond any expectations I had of gracuoius hosting on an airline. It is one thing for an attendant to smile and exercise politeness, but for that hospitality to be utterly genuine and emanate from a truly warm person is quite something else. While all of my interactions with this caring young woman were highlights of an already exemplary trip, I was really touched when she brought me a little package of gifts for my 5-year old step daughter Okubo learned I was visiting. \n\nI wish I could travel everywhere on this airline with this attendant; I'm afraid that JAL and Okubo have left me quite spoiled. \n\nI would not hesitate to recommend any of JAL's international flights, particularly for any who might be reluctant to travel so far.  Oh, and lest I forget, the flight was among the smoothed ever encountered, even when we hit a bit of turbulence that would have gone unnoticed had the pilot not told us. And lest I forget, part 2: the check-in woman in Boston was also top-notch.",

The collected our luggage from AC and WJ and forwarded it to our hotel in Bangkok the next day.\nWhen we left ko Samui, Bangkok Airlines flights were suspended due to rain, so we were 18 hours late leaving, barely made the JAL flight home and they located our luggage from Bangkok Airways for us and arranged for it to come to Calgary-something they were not responsible for as i wasnt their fault or responsibility.\nThey did help, they earned my respect for sure.\nThe flight itself was amazing, staff were terrific, service phenomnenal and the food outstanding. WIll definately fly JAL again overseas.\nCannot say enough great things about them",

The best among the attendants during our flight was Mami Ito; she was very polite and made us feel like customers are kings & queens indeed. There was another customer who was next to us who was not feeling well and Mami treated him very nicely. I could tell that the whole staff - flight attendants- worked non stop to assure the customers were well served. We were definitely satisfied with this service and would book ticket from Air Japan again. On the flight back from Tokyo to San Francisco (on United airlines) the service was not comparable even though we were on the same (business) class.",

Excellent space for storing items that you want at hand (as well as overhead storage). Large screen for movies, videos, etc, with great earphones. Blankets, slippers, and amenity kits were waiting in our seats when we boarded, and cardigans were distributed shortly after takeoff. We reserved Western and Japanese meals ahead of time, but my husband and son easily switched to Japanese meals for the flight home once boarded. Also an amazing array of dishes (such as sandwiches, udon, bento box, even ice cream) available on demand during the flight up to two hours before landing. The bathroom was kept spotless with toothbrush kits and mouthwash available at all times.

        "review_text": "When Boeing's Dreamliners first arrived, JAL jumped at the opportunity to fly directly from Tokyo to San Diego, which has a small airport incapable of handling the big passenger birds of yesterday. But JAL really screwed up. The interior they chose places entertainment equipment boxes under -- as far as I can tell -- 75% of the economy-class seats. In other words, JAL went out of its way to cause its passengers on this route 12 hours of pain. For tall people, it is impossible to sit behind a seat with an entertainment equipment box under it without pinning one foot behind the knee. This causes me pain that lasts for days. There are other problems. The seats themselves are the most uncomfortable seats of any kind I have ever sat in. They are worse than bar stools. They cause me hamstring and back pain that also lasts for days. Also, the jet's interior is beginning to age and look dirty. While these flights are an absolutely miserable 10-12 hours, they are still convenient. They save time in two ways. You do not have to make a stop at another airport and wait around for a connecting flight. And San Diego's airport gets few international flights, so customs and immigration is a breeze. Plus, it's San Diego. The airport is right along the harbor; it's a beautiful place to step off a plane. And the customs and immigration people are San Diegans -- friendly, helpful and genuinely happy that you are visiting their city. While I can't recommend San Diego enough as an international destination for anyone living in Tokyo, JAL really needs to remodel the interior of its NRT-SAN Dreamliner and make it not so painful. One more note: Since JAL has a monopoly on this route, it's super expensive. If you have the time, you're much better off taking United and transferring in SFO.",

This is about a seven-hour flight that leaves Haneda Airport at 12:05, just after midnight. The airplane's interior is brand new. Seat pockets fit more stuff inside them. There seems to be more leg room. I saw no entertainment equipment boxes under seats. These hard metallic, immovable boxes can ruin a flight by pinning your foot behind your knee. If you are tall, you will feel the pain for days after disembarking. So cheers for JAL getting rid of these damn boxes on its midnight HND-BKK route. But why ruin the effort and all that added comfort by turning up the lights two hours before arrival to feed us a meal of flapdoodle airline food? Let your customers sleep on overnight flights, JAL. Don't force us to eat unneeded carbs at 5 o'clock in the morning Tokyo time and cause all kinds of commotion on a previously quiet flight. One more note: The new seats are mostly great, but the bottoms curve up in the back and jab your tailbone. The seats also seem to angle downward, which keeps passengers sliding forward. This runs from being unpleasant to annoying to painful.",

IMO the most useful benefit when traveling with JAL was the free wi-fi connection in Japan, provided by NTT-East and Wi2 Wi-Fi. To use this service, you need to register on JAL website and provide your ticket information. The wi-fi connection can be accessed easily by using the Travel Japan Wi-Fi app.",

A year ago I booked flights from CVG to ORD on American Airlines first class and then on to NRT First from ORD JAL 9 and then on to Bangkok JAL Biz.  The leg from Chicago to Tokyo was one of the high points of my flying experiences.  There are 8 suites on the 777-300 and only four, including my wife and I, were occupied.  Since it was New Year's Eve the whole plane was only about half full.  The FAs were fantastically attentive.  The food, especially the Japanese items, was over the top great.  You could order what you wanted, when you wanted.  Each passenger got one of the other suites made up into a bed so there was no inconvenience of having to transition between bed and chair.  I know, I know, FWP.  We did have to spend a 19 hour layover at Haneda at the Excel Airport Hotel after a 45 minute shuttle bus ride, but what the heck.  Today we flew from Haneda to BKK Biz on a 777-200.  The service was also great, just not as luxurious and over the top as the 13.5 hrs in First.  The food was very good, Salmon and pasta with one of the best deserts I ever had, a Green tea custard with white chocolate hollow balls filled with some kind of green tea syrup. Wow, knock your socks off good.  The whole trip was booked with 67,500 AA miles each before the AA devaluation early 2016.  We used Mile Value booking service for $125 each and worth every penny.",

        "review_text": "Flew JAL Vancouver to Narita round trip (JL17 & JL18).  Both were on the B787 Dreamliner which is a very nice newish plane with mood lighting, larger windows, very quiet, generous overhead bins and toilets with the sprayer function common in Japan.  Unfortunately JAL opted for angle flat seats on these overnight flights so sleep is not as comfortable as most other major international airline business class. I find I do tend to slide down the angle flat bed but width and comfort of the seat was generally good.  Entertainment is OK but there is slightly less selection of movies and programs than for example on Cathay Pacific.  The real strength of JAL however is in the service.  The flight attendants are constantly working, go about their duties quietly and with elegance and make you feel truly well cared for during the flight.  They are also constantly cleaning the toilets which on a long-haul flight makes a big difference to the comfort of using the washrooms.  Food is also very good on JAL.  I tried both the Japanese meal and the Western meal.  Both are very strong.  The Japanese meal typically starts with a box containing 9 different little appetizers - always intriguing and interesting but difficult to remember which is which after reading the detailed descriptions in the menu.  The Western meal that I remember was shortribs and it was succulent and tender.  Japan Airlines also serves a special coffee in business class and in its lounges which is really delicious - probably the best coffee I have had on any airline - but unfortunately is exclusive to their flights and lounges and not sold (I asked and it is not available as part of their in flight sales).  \nI also used the lounges.  In Vancouver, it is unfortunately just the Plaza Premium lounge which is open to membership subscriptions or drop ins and is crowded and not very nice.  However in Narita, I used the First Class lounge as I have One World Alliance status and it is a superb lounge - elegant and understated as is the Japanese way, with two sushi chefs making sushi to order, a buffet area with Western and Japanese/Chinese food, massage chairs and also massage therapists for quick 10 minute massage treatments.  The lounge also served high quality Suntory whiskeys which are very enjoyable.     \nWhen one flies Japan Airlines, whether on the ground or in the air, the one thing that you can rely on is superb attentive and elegant service at a level head and shoulder above Western airlines.",

Economy seats comfortable and more spacious, plane and all the facilities were very clean and frequently cleaned. Meals served efficiently but with a personal service.  Snacks and additional drinks available throughout the flight. \n\nReturn flight I bought an upgrade to Premium economy at the airport, the seats have more space between them and foot rest, seats don't recline backwards so you are not being crushed by the passenger in front's seat.   Also a larger TV screen.  Special thanks to Colin and Federico for service on return flight. \n\nBoth flights great experience, I will definitely be choosing JAL again.",

Great take off and breakfast was above average for airline food. Inflight entertainment was extensive and good, showing a good range of movies and TV shows. Crew were very friendly and cheery. When we landed we forgot our passports on the plane, and the crew kept hold of them and waited outside of the plane for us to return (which we did). We are flying with them again in JAN and would highly recommend them to anyone.",

We only had 1-way tickets since we were staying abroad for 10 months and did not have solid plans on when we would return.  I was able to check in fine and had to run back to the gate to see what happened.  Luckily we had data connection on our phones and quickly purchased cheap plane tickets to appease the rude attendant.  It was all very stressful and we almost missed our international flight.  Seems absurd as we were flying business class and they didn't ask me (a male) anything about my onward travel plans.  Asian cultures are known for female inequality, but this was absurd.\n\nThe plane was comfortable, but this whole ordeal ruined our experience.  I contacted their customer support and received some canned apology which seemed very insincere.",

Unfortunately, we had seats next to an arrogant person who was demanding and felt very entitled.   He couldn't stop yelling/complaining to every flight attendant on the plane about how the movies didn't work and how he wanted a refund for him and his family.  Felt horrible for the flight attendants to have to deal with a person like this, let alone him waking us up every time he would raise his voice to try and get something for free.",

On the 1st flight from Dallas to Narita, we had chatted with one of the flight attendants Annabella about our son's upcoming 2nd birthday that same weekend. Later on she surprised him with a little gift bag filled with goodies and small toys and a personalized note wishing him a Happy Birthday. That was sweet beyond words and meant a lot to us. THANK YOU!! \n\nOh, flying on the magnificent Dreamliner is amazing! More room in general for the entire cabin and leg room at the seats and not filling like we're cramped sardines in a tin can. :) As long as we can get great deals, we will definitely be flying this route with JAL again.",

        "review_text": "I flew JAL business class from Tokyo to Helsinki. The staff were very attentive and friendly. The plane felt new, and the interior was clean. The cabin was kept very clean during the entire flight.\n\nMy seat was an aisle seat in the middle section, in 2-2-2 seats. The layout is such that the window seat has its own little passageway, so it would have been just as good as an aisle, but with more privacy. The access to my seat was wide open on the aisle side - too wide - so it felt a little too exposed. There was a retractable blind blocking the other person next to me, so it was private on that side. There is also a foam mattress for every seat that the flight attendant will prepare, so it is really comfortable to sleep and then you don't feel all the usual cracks and bends characterizing today's business class seats. \n\nI had pre-ordered a vegetarian meal, and I was happy I did that. The main course otherwise would have been beef tongue (!) and something more Western, but the fact that beef tongue was the headline meal was a little shocking for me. Anyway, my meal had the best salad on-board I have ever had, both in presentation and quality, and the attendant tailored the offering to consider other food sensitivities and preferences I had. In addition to the wines, fine sake was offered, so it was interesting to try those. \n\nThe inflight entertainment is much more limited than other airlines, there were not so many films to choose from. Screen and headphone quality was good. \n\nWhen we arrived in Helsinki, this huge plane was parked out away from the terminal. We had to walk down portable stairs and board a bus. That would have been really miserable in bad weather. I didn't like Helsinki airport at all or the connecting Finnair flight. JAL business class passengers had to queue for the security check in line with everyone, there was not any express or priority line.",

So we switched.\n\nService starts at the check in.   Upon seeing a dent on one of our luggages, the check in staff offered to wrap our luggage in a plastic bag, something that not all airlines will do (even for business class).   We were offered access to the Qantas lounge but we used the new CX lounge instead.    It was busy but staff was efficient.\n\nService on board was great.   They don't serve pre-take off drink which is a bit odd but no big deal.   No amenity kits were offered on this regional flight but there was a pair of slippers in each seat and one of the flight attendants came by with a tray offering eye mask and ear plugs.    \n\nLunch order was taken shortly after the seat belt sign went off.   I opted for the Japanese set.    Presentation was great.   And the taste was even better.    \n\nThe seat was an angled lie flat one which is more than enough for a 4 hrs flight.    IFE was nice, with a selection of Japanese and English movies and TV programs.   Quite surprised that they offer season 1 of ER so nice to watch an episode of the classic show.   \n\nJAL business product (seat & IFE) may not be as good when compared to other airlines on this regional route but what they lack in hardware, they make it up with customer services and catering.",

The Purser and attendants make it a point to address us by name. Bathrooms were cleaned after every use and toothbrushes, packet mouthwash beautifully presented for the next passenger. Every five minutes or so, an attendant would walk through the cabin and look to be of service. The US airlines can\u2019t compare with this attention to detail.\n\nDining was served in courses (unlike Delta Business) but food (Western & Japanese) was not exceptional.\n\nTwo big gripes were the actual JAL Sky Suite II bed. Hard as a rock, narrow and no space to turn your feet when in bed-mode. Will never fly with this product ever again! The JAL Sky Suite III (which wasn\u2019t available for our trip) is much, much better for comfort.\nOther problem was the warm cabin. It was probably the warmest cabins I\u2019ve ever flown in. Attendants obliged with turning the a/c down a notch but it was still uncomfortable. That said, our next flight is on ANA.\n\nAgain, service superb on the ground and inflight. Avoid the 767 JAL Sky Suite II \u2013 and if they could fix the warm cabins, I\u2019d give the airline five stars!\n\nJAL Lounge in Narita was fantastic though. Nap rooms, wonderful shower facilities, lovely spread of food, massage chairs, all add up to a great transit experience.",

        "review_text": "Requested an aisle seat on check-in but due to full capacity none was available. The check-in counter staff kindly made arrangements to be upgraded to Premium Economy for free (without me requesting to be upgraded).\nThe upgrade was a pleasant surprise and made for a very pleasant journey (10 hours).\nThe seat has a lot of legroom and at 6' I could stretch out as much as I wanted to without issue. \nThe seats don't recline but rather slide down and forward which is great as it doesn't bother the passenger behind. There is a leg support that comes up from the bottom of the seat and also a foot rest.\nThe foot well had a lot of space so even with my shoes off and stored there I could sit comfortably.\nThe seats have a double arm rest each so there's no issues as to 'who gets to use it' allowing for all passengers in this class to sit and move around in the seat without disturbing the person alongside.\nFood was okay and inflight entertainment was also fine (controlled by either touchscreen or controller).\nC.A.s were very professional, courteous helpful and always smiling which really does make for a pleasant atmosphere.\nUpgrade to Premium Economy varies on distance. SYD to NRT would have been 30,000 Yen which really adds up on a return journey but some shorter flights to Asian destinations (H.K.?) can be had for just 10,000 Yen each way which I wouldn't hesitate to pay for!\nGreat seat, great service and made a 10 hour fight pleasant as opposed to bearable.\nHighly recommend flying JAL and Premium Economy. I wouldn't even bother with paying for business class if a Premium Economy seat is available as the extra cost isn't justified considering how comfortable the seating was.",

Much to my pleasant surprise I was informed at boarding one was available and was assigned it.\nThat's an example of great service by staff who are already very busy! It made the flight much more comfortable.\nThe seat was a 'Sky Wider' seat and one of the most spacious for an economy class I've flown on long distance. at 6' I had no issues with leg room and the USB charger was very convenient.\nFood was okay but the C.A.s were very friendly,courteous and professional.\nI hadn't much considered flying JAL before but they're now the first airline I'll look to fly with!",

I was given new flight,but it was explained to me that is it special case which I understand and am grateful.

        "review_text": "I flew Japan Airlines flight 9 from Chicago O'Hare direct to Tokyo Narita and then continued on JAL to Osaka Itami. I paid extra for premium economy for the 12 hour (ORD - NAR) flight. The extra expense was definitely worth the price. You get a little more seat width, massive amount of leg room and slightly better food/drink choices. \n\nThe staff on this flight were very, very nice. I've also flown this route on United. While there staff were also pleasant, they never seemed as gracious as the Japan Airlines ladies. At the end of the flight, my flight attendant stopped by every passenger and personally thanked them for flying their airline. She also asked if they needed anything right before landing.\n\nEntertainment options were decent. I thought there would be more but the options were fine. Several recent English language movies. Several music channels (although most seemed to be Japanese). There was also a daily 30 minute news program focused on international news. I'm not sure if regular economy people get them but our seats included complementary noise cancelling headphones. Nothing extravagant (Sony brand) but a nice amenity nonetheless.\n\nI think I had unreasonably high expectations for this airline. I heard that it's such a great option from USA to Japan. I sort of built it up to be this amazing experience. It is certainly a nice airline but I'm not sure it's any better than ANA. I just don't know. \n\nWhat I can say is that this airline and this flight was really nice. Premium economy made the flight more bearable. Let's me real, though. The trip is not enjoyable unless you have a lie-flat bed in business or first class, which is very expensive. But by looking at the people in regular coach, I think I would have been in hell had I not paid the extra money for premium economy. I recommend this to anyone who is tall or overweight ... or who just doesn't enjoy very long flights.",

The beverages are non-stop, so you won't have to worry about staying hydrated, legroom is not an issue, you can get out of the window seat without having to ask the person on the aisle to get up because of all the legroom in premium economy.  Even the small things are noticeable, in Japan, the check-in agent comes out from the counter to the line and asks you to come to their numbered location, and on departure the ground crew came out and formed a three person line and waived and bowed while the plane taxied out.  They do it right, if you ever have a need to fly to the far east I would definitely say I look forward to flying on JAL when we go back to China next year!!",

We booked our trip 6 months in advance and got an awesome rate ... less than $1600 round trip for both of us. JAL had great service, entertainment, and food. The American airlines could learn a few things from JAL. My only concern was JAL has a 3 day prior to take off policy to select your seats. Better mark your calendar or you could forget to select your seats and get something that is not desirable. On our leg from Tokyo to Jakarta we were asked if we wanted seats closer to the front. So we said yes ... the plane was not full and we sat in the row right behind first class. Wonderful Service, we will fly with JAL in the future!",

I flew with them about 20 yrs ago and the service was bad , really bad, as bad as US domestic airlines!\n\nBut what surprised me is that JAL has reinvent itself totally - from the time we check-in (I was with my parents on wheelchair) to leading us into our seats - incredibly nice &  polite service that I cannot find in any other airlines !!! The attention to details cannot exist in today's cut throat industry!\n\nWow, if U find similar services level in the US or in any country, I would love to know!",

I am pregnant and had shown a letter stating that I am safe to fly when checking in. Other than that, I never mentioned it to anyone. They gave me priority boarding. When my husband and I were seated, we had two middle seats with a disabled lady on one side, so a bit difficult to get out of. We never complained at all. But, after takeoff, the flight attendant came and asked us to move. We couldn't quite catch everything she said due to the noise, but two employees switched seats with us so that we could move to two seats on one side together with more room and easier access. Amazing! \n\nShe later gave us an extra bag of snacks and repeatedly checked that we were alright. At the end of the flight, she even came by with a \"gift for your baby.\" A little fork and spoon set in a cute Japan Airlines carrying case. So considerate! \n\nWe flew back again and we were just treated so considerately by all personnel. We will now go out if our way to fly JAL every chance we get in the future! Thank you!!",

The seat was comfortable and fully flat.\n\nEven though JAL didn't give any pouch, but their have distributed very comfortable pyjama, and toiletries like eye and facial masks! \n\nThe all new meal menu and alcohol selections were excellent. \n\nAnd, I would like to specially mentioned that even though it was a 7-hour journal, the air stewardess didn't stop patrolling around and attended to any request from the customers. \n\nIt was indeed a very pleasant flight.",

Noise cancelling headphones were a nice touch, the movie inventory wasn't very good and not everything is in English, probably my biggest complaint.  Dimming windows worked well.   Generally the service was very good, probably not far off of Singapore Air or Swiss, two of my favorites.  The better air quality on the 787 was much more comfortable than other planes.  I highly recommend the 787 for long haul for this reason alone. On departure, I got a comp invite to airline lounge which was a nice touch.",

Huge tv screens that don't need to be flipped out and replaced, space for putting items where they can be reached, magazine holders and somewhere to put rubbish are all very welcome on a long flight. Compared to most of the other business class cabins I've tried on other airlines they are far superior - except for their food ! The menu is designed by someone who is attempting to be creative and innovative and is failing miserably !!! There are a few nice items but most is inedible. My sixteen year old son who us usually ravenous refuses to eat anything other than the rice. The other problem is that they don't serve breakfast at the end of an overnight flight. They serve food but I wish they'd learn from ither airlines and iffer breakfast foods at breakfast time. They need to replace their caterers. Then they'll be perfect.",

They finally decided it was something I could use on the plane and left me alone.  I did show them the sticker saying it was approved by the FAA for use on aircraft, but I am not sure they understood that.  \n\nThe interface for games and movies was a bit more modern than I am used to.  They had a great selection.  I think this must have been a newer plane.",

        "review_text": "I picked JAL based on Youtube videos I saw where their Economy class seats had plenty of legroom. Imagine my surprise when I got on the plane (Los Angeles to Osaka) and saw how cramped and small the seats were. I used to be one of those people who didn't understand why passengers fought over reclining seats. After flying JAL, I see why. The woman in the seat in front of me extended her seat all the way back, which took up all my personal space. I literally wanted to push her and the seat out of frustration. With her seat fully extended, I couldn't get out of my seat to use the restroom, so I had to hold on to her seat in order to get up, which I'm sure it annoyed her, but oh well. Also, while trying to stretch, I accidentally kicked the feet of the woman sitting in front of me. There's not even enough room to stretch while seated, unless you're a really short person (I, for the record, am 5'5\"). The seats were 2-4-2 on this flight. My friend and I sat in the row with 2 seats.\n\nThe food was quite tasty. The flight attendants were very friendly. The ones who weren't fluent in English tended hand me things and run away. The flight attendants who are fluent in English took their time explaining things to me. I really loved the fact that JAL darken out the windows so that people can sleep after they serve the first meal. This was my first international flight, so I've never seen that done before.\n\nOn my flight from Osaka to Tokyo, the seats were way more comfortable. There were no individual TVs on the seats though. The man seated in the row ahead of me asked if it was OK for him to extend his seat, which I thought was extremely courteous. There was plenty of legroom and I could extend my legs without accidentally kicking the feet of the person sitting in front of me. I loved everything about JAL except for the small and cramped seats on my 10 hour flight from Los Angeles to Osaka.",

During our trip back, not only would they not allow her to bring it on the plane, not one representative of the airline understood English and we almost missed our flight because of this. I repeatedly told them we were happy to leave the tripod and they could dispose it as they saw fit, but they then told me I could not get on the plane unless I picked up the tripod from security. Either way they were not allowing me to get on the plane. They separated my daughter and me and made me run through the airport, not once, but twice insisting I was going to miss my flight if I didn't run at full speed with my carry on luggage in tow. After running for 15 minutes straight, I get to the gate to be informed there is an hour delay! No one could have told the airline representative that as she was insisting I run at full speed back and forth through the airport?!",

First up, it was maybe half business class and the other half economy (with a small premium economy section).\n\nSecondly, the economy configuration which was of the 2-4-2 configuration was great. It meant more width in the seat. Also, this flight has the biggest legroom I have ever seen. Was just on an Emirates Boeing 777 a couple of weeks before this flight and although quite good (Emirates does 3-4-3), this JAL 787-9 was heaps better.\n\nFood was good too with great service. Do try their Sky Time Kiwi Juice. Its kinda weird but nice in a good way.\n\nOnly thing I had a slight issue with is temperature. Usually when flying, there are air-con vents above you which you can adjust. On this flight though, there werent any. Which made the aircraft a little on the warm side for me. Me and my dad were using the safety information card to fan ourselves during decent as it got warmer. Maybe flying a night flight might mitigate this.",

Over the years I have found JL to be consistent in their service delivery.\n\nFrom the moment you enter check in to completion of your flight you are dealing with smiling and service minded personnel and crew. \n\nWithin reason nothing seem too much for JL\u2019s staff and crew to ensure your experience is the best possible. \n\nBefore I continue I just like to point out that over the last 30 years I have travelled with more airlines than I care to remember, some strand out as very good, few come up to a standard similar to that of JL.\n\nI have travelled in all classes with JL, irrespective of class of travel their service level is high. Food even in Economy class is of high standard. I once travelled JL414 sector Tokyo Helsinki with a friend of mine. We had just being served our first meal accompanied by a small bottle of Sake; (at our request,) my friend said \u201cif this is what we are eating in Economy class, what on earth are they enjoying in Business class\u201d. \n  \nI always find the cabin spotless the same goes for the toilettes, the crew are constantly cleaning lavatories throughout the duration of the flight making sure everything is A1. \n\nOnly negative, the inflight announcements are hard to hear and understand, this due to low volume and sometimes poor English pronunciation the later depending on the crew member of cause. I would like to see JL introducing English prerecorded inflight announcements. I am fully aware that sometimes the operating crew has to make announcements in the cabin for various reasons.   \n\nSummary of the above, I mainly had Economy class in mind here as majority of passengers travel in Economy class. JL\u2019s premium Economy is of very good standard, entering Business and First class, we are talking excelent.\n\nLegroom is ample, I\u2019m 1.80cm (5' 11) I am very comfortable when in Economy class including onboard their 787 Dreamliner. Seat comfort I feel is good no complains there. \n\nCatering as mentioned above of high standard, the amount of food is just right, snacks are available throughout the flight.\n\nDrinks are complementary on JL, however the crew rightfully so reserves the right to refuse serving alcoholic beverage to any passenger who may be intoxicated.\n\nAs far as fares are concerned, JL are matching other Airlines there is not a great deal of fare difference from any other carrier as far as I have found.\n\nI can highly recommend Japan Airlines, If you are in Japan flying JL, try to see if you can obtain a special stop over package through JL",

However the check-in process at the Osaka Itami airport was terribly slow. Once again there is no separate queue for those who have done online check-in. \n\nJAL just added on an extra 10cm to the legroom and yes, it means a lot. The seats are much more spacious even though you are in Economy. Meals on board are of good quality and I would say this is the most tasty airline meal I have ever tried! \n\nDrinks service are regular and the cabin crew are very friendly. However, I have only 1 complain - the cabin temperature is very warm.",

        "review_text": "After being told several years ago, by friends, about their positive experience with JAL flying from Sydney to London my wife and I decided to fly JAL on our recent (February 2016) trip to France and Italy.\nWe decided to fly premium economy, as on a cost basis it was certainly cheaper than going via the U.A.E. plus it also included overnight accommodation at Narita airport before the on flight to Paris.\n\nWe flew the entire outward bound sector on a Boeing 777.\nJAL's aircraft are modern, clean, reasonably quiet, comfortable and bright. \n\nThe seating in Premium Economy is first rate. There is plenty of leg room and the seats have generous width. A big, big plus is that the seat in front does not recline into your personal space and likewise neither does your seat  encroach on your fellow passenger. You are also supplied with Sony noise cancelling headphones and a great selection of movies and to make the trip even more comfortable slippers and a blankets. The presentation of all these extra as one expects from Japan was impressive.\n\nAnother feature about JAL Premium Economy, which we did not realise when booking, is that JAL give you access to their Business Class lounge as part of the fare.\n\nOn our return leg to Australia and without going into great detail, as a result of the impact of the terrorists attack in Paris in late 2015, we were changed to a Qantas 747, \"premium economy\" flight not out of Narita but out of Haneda.\n\nWe thought that this would be an equally wonderful experience. Needless to stay, what a disgrace. Old, extremely noisey, uncomfortable, cramped. I cannot describe how disgusted we both were with the \"Qantas experience\".\n\nWhen the passenger in front, reclined their seat, the only way out to the single toilet, also shared with business class, was to do a Chubby Checker Twist to get out of the row. The so called crappy noise cancelling headphone were served up in a reused plastic bag, making me think that the headphones from the previous user had just had the cord rewound and shoved back into a plastic bag. I did even want to put them on.\n\nThe food so so ordinary, we didn't eat it.\n\nAlso with Qantas you don't have access to the Business Class lounge.\n\nWhen we fly again it will definitely be with JAL. A great airline.",

I currently use your JFK to Narita flight, (JL3 and JL6 on return) and will be using it again in two more weeks on October 16th in the morning. \n\nThe flight attendants are welcoming, very friendly, respectful and definitely make sure those long hours on the plane will be as comfortable as possible. \n\nFrom check-in to getting on the plane was the most simple procedure. Checking in online is recommended, but even if you do it at the airport, It's not a big deal. Both are fairly simple processes. \n\nOn the plane, you have a large variety of movies, music, games and maps to keep you occupied. They have multiple languages, so again, It's not usually a problem. You can also read Manga and watch Anime! Both of which I enjoy.\n\nThe planes are always in top shape, very clean and ready for the next customers to come aboard. The flight attendants also speak good English, and there is plenty of leg room! Even in the Economy seats. Overall, It's a very comfortable flight. \n\nEconomy provides you with a very nice meal on the JFK to NRT route and then back to JFK. Last year, they had Beef Bowls from Yoshinoya on the route back to JFK. That was great! \n\nOverall, I love Japan Airlines for my flights to Japan and will continue using them as long as I go to Japan. \n\n5 out of 5 stars for me. A very happy customer with JAL. \n\nThank you for all you do to keep the flight comfortable, and keep us happy. \n\nKeep up the good work over there at JAL.",

I tried the Japanese dishes and was delicious.\n\nThe lounge at Narita was busy, but roomy. they have an upstairs dining room which is well catered for and serves modern and traditional meals. As per usual, they have ample seating, free WiFi and food and beverages. They have an automated beer serving machine... a must to see it in action.\n\nThe flight from NRT-CDG was with a B787. Every seat has direct isle access (2-2 layout) and has the MK II Sky suite installed, however... It has marked improvements to it then on their B777. The suite is more digitalised and automated. The meals were again outstanding (I had the Japanese meals again). I also ordered the snack food from the seat PDA and it was delivered promptly. The aircraft and crew were faultless. \n\nThe check in at both locations (Overnight stay in Tokyo) was seamless. I checked my bags all the way through so I avoided waiting for them in NRT.

We actually started with a connecting flight from Hong Kong, also on JAL, so the total flying time was close to 17 hours.  Check-in was smooth and our bags were transferred without problems.  There were plenty  of food and beverage options, both Japanese and Western.  The quality of the fixed menus and the a-la-carte choices was excellent.  The number of flight attendants was sufficient to provide efficient and friendly service.  The aircraft from Narita to Boston was a 787 with comfortable seats in the upright, relaxed and bed positions.  Entertainment choices were plentiful and the electronics were in good working order.  I bought an expensive full-fare business ticket for myself and combined it with a low-cost companion ticket for my wife though one of our credit-card programs, which made the cost for two competitive with other business fare options on other airlines.  I highly recommend JAL for flights from the US East Coast to East Asia.",

On JAL, the seats were wide enough and the leg room ample enough so that we didn't feel cramped.  Even the bathrooms were large, highly recommended for anyone with mobility issues.  There were enough bathrooms, too.  The food was excellent.  Our breakfast, a rice bowl with condiments, came with a card identifying the food and instructions on how to enjoy it.  I ate every bit.  If I have a choice, I will always choose JAL for trans-ocean flights.",

From my experience, Japan Airline stewardesses are well informed and always make note about arrival time, number of passengers, etc. The business class seats are a bit narrow ... and I wish the cabin temperature can be lowered to about 21 degrees C, so we can enjoy sleeping under the blanket, not sweating... When standing at the galleys area, the temperature is nice and cool... but the cabin is too warm. For me the availability of toilet showers are one of the best comfort. \nLook forward to fly again on JAL, the food is always good and by making a transit stay for one or more nights in Japan, we will not suffer from jet lag when travelling from and to the US. By allowing (no extra charge) for transit in Japan (one or two nights following the transit visa / shore pass regulation), I am sure more traveler will take JAL when travelling to the US and it will be good for tourism in Chiba and Japan ...",

The JAL route to Europe has two advantages over other Australia-Europe routes: (1) it divides the flight into more even legs (the total time is not longer than with, say, Singapore Airlines); (2) because it flies almost over the north pole it avoids war zones. The service on board was excellent, and there is a choice of Japanese or European menus. The only small downside is that, even with the mattress provided, the beds are a bit hard.",

Flights are normally pretty similar, maybe slightly better food or facilities, but you pretty much know what you're getting. \n\nHowever, JAL surpassed any airline I've ever flown on and the customer service and food was outstanding. We flew economy but this was even better than any premium economy either.\n\nThe staff went out of their way for you, without you asking for it. Jesus, who was in the back cabin of BA4603 on 24th September, noticed I was hot when I was getting on the plane and came with cold water and sorted out the air con. He was lovely to chat to and offered to bring my dinner later and heat it up as I was asleep when it was brought round. I'm not a great traveller, despite flying several times a year, so he made the experience much more pleasant.\n\nThe food was such a delight! Such good quality and I actually ate it all (which I don't normally do on a flight).\n\nIt felt like flying was, back in the 90s. Great service, great food, with some thought put into it, and the experience made you feel a bit special.",

The Japanese appreciate someone who can handle their scotch and are respectful and non-judgmental.  The Hibiki 17 yr old and Chivas Royal Salute went down very well.\nThey are obviously proud of their menu which is very good.\nThe WiFi didn't work that well but why be on the phone when on a flight like this.\nOn the return the JAL Sakura lounge is good too with a sushi bar and sake bar.

My husband got the window seat, and I got the aisle, so even though I couldn't get a proper view of outside, at least I could've slide my privacy window up...automatically, so I can hide my jealously. I had access to all the latest american movies and even japanese and indian films- with caption. \nI also had enough space to store all my knick-knacks, extra bags and books.\nFood was awesome, I had 3 course options, japanese, western and I can't remember the other. I chose the japanese, it had so many different items from prawn, lotus root, egg roll, eel, duck, pufferfish and more. Some items in this course came in a tray, looked like food samples, but nevertheless was fulling. The meal was the most interesting, it was like a food feast in the air. I even got to make my own origami. My fight attendant offered to wake me up for breakfast- a first I've encountered on a flight, which I truly appreciated.",

Both new planes were very comfortable; I especially like the touch screen monitors and bathrooms. The cabin services were excellent throughout the trip. The pilot landed the 777 in foul weather at Narita very smoothly. However I was disappointed with the food served this entire trip. I had expected better tasting food from JAL. It may be just me but I found the packaging of meals especially annoying and difficult for someone with arthritic fingers. I did like the miso soup, served hot from a pitcher. My mochi ice cream was frozen.  Passengers with connecting flights had to go through another security check. Because Narita had only one machine operating there was a long queue. The bottleneck made us nervous about missing out flight. Turned out our flight was delayed by half an hour before takeoff anyway.",

They even had toothbrushes in the lavatory.  The flight attendants served 2 meals on the flight.  Neither was really tasty, but at least it was something to eat.  There was a box of snacks available between meals.  The flight attendants were polite and gracious as you would expect of the Japanese.  Check in, security, customs and boarding were a breeze at the Osaka airport.",

Everyone from the checkin to the stewardess are so friendly. I never had any problems. The staff are so professional too. They deliver service with a smile all the time. I know most people who choose airlines would usually go for the cheapest price first but not me. I always look for how well the staff treats the customer. I really do not mind paying the price to ride this Airline.,to me it is well worth it. I would give this Airline a 5 star . I also would recommend Japan Airlines to everyone out there. The food is also so good. So when I exit the plane,I always bow to the staff because I appreciate them. Japan Airlines is the safest to ride in my opinion!",

Although the flight is full, we have no problem storing our hand carry in the overhead compartment. (Unlike some other airlines, it may be lucky that you find room to store your hand carry as other passengers seem to have so many hand carry luggage and the airline is not stopping them)\n\nThe JAL air hostesses are very polite and attentive, the meals are decent and JAL is generous with their drinks (and you can help yourselves to snacks during the flight).",

Of course Japan Airlines being Japans national carrier would make a tremendous job in serving the best Japanese \"airline\" food onboard. I also find their flight crew one of the most courteous crew among all airlines. There is something different on how Japanese talk and give service. They speak almost in whispers and they move very gracefully. The flight crew were all Japanese except there was one time we flew to Bangkok also using JAL and our flight crew were of different nationalities and they stayed in the same hotel we stayed in. We got to talk to some of them and the Japan Airline crew was being trained in Bangkok. I guess the training of JAL flight crew is very different and its very exceptional. I don't mind flying with JAL again, the seats are OK, food is good and crew is exceptional!",

My first meal was excellent \n(but my partner says never choose the fish) The staff are superb. REALLY good staff. One of the gentlest landings ever. There were some slight delays (Sydney Airport's fault) and you could tell they really cared about not being on schedule. They made up the time on the way and we arrived bang on. If you are flush with funds go for it for the space... but if money's too tight to mention their economy is pretty good too.",

While waiting for boarding the domestic connection, the captain actually reach out every kid and say hi and give them stickers. This kind of service which I used to see 30 years ago but hardly see these days. JAL really give you a feeling of being a customer rather than a passenger. \nJAL was my first flight 30 years ago and after 30 years later, they did let me down.\nStrongly recommended if you are travelling with young kids.",

        "review_text": "I live in Japan so I traveled with Jal a lot of times to a lot of places and I always have mixed feelings about it. The price of the ticket was not too expensive but Jal usually is, they are a very prestigious airline famed for always being on time and their  very high standards. I agree, just like pretty much everything in Japan they live up to their standards, specially in safety and service. However on this particular flight I was not happy at all, the flight going to Bangkok the aircraft was much older and the way back had a very new, very nice aircraft. One good thing was there was more space, even my very tall husband was happy that the leg space on economy class was bigger and on both the older and newer plane. The entertainment system was much better on the newer airplane, but the movie selection was very good and similar in both. \nNow the bad, I never flew with Jal that I actually liked their food, this time was no exception, it was a midnight flight and they did not serve dinner, just a pastry that I couldn't figure what it tasted like and some nuts. I didn't eat at the airport cause Haneda does not have lots of options either so I was hungry until morning. Well, morning breakfast wasn't great either, on the flight back was the same thing, a dinner but no choice at all, usually every airline has a western choice, this did not thou the food wasn't as terrible this time. After flying 7 hours there was nothing at breakfast only coffee, well still they turn the lights on 2 hours before landing so you basically cut on the very little extra sleep you could have had. It seemed as they are trying to cut on costs. Also surprisingly the service was not the best, some of the flight attendants did not speak english well, it was a little hard to communicate and also a bit rude, not likely to Japan at all. I was disappointed, specially since my next flight was with Bangkok Airways and they won so much with me with service and super tasty food in a very short flight, I could definitely tell the difference. I was never a big fan o Jal for long flights and besides de extra space I'm not sure I would choose them again.",

Meals are created by renowned culinary chefs in Japan. I always ordered Japanese meals but Western ones look appetizing as well.  I once had lamb chop on the flight from NRT to LAX and it was surprisingly good!\n\nMovies on board have many choices including the newest released.  Screen is very good size.\n\nSakura Lounge at Narita Airport for Business Class is very decent.  You just can go to the one nearest to your boarding gate.  If someone is fortunate enough to get into the First Class Lounge, made to order sushi may be the best choice.  At the Sakura Lounge,  you can also have rice, noodles, hot soup....besides all kinds of beverages.\nThe airport and lounges are sparkling clean!\n\nOne more hint is that reservation should be made as soon as possible if you plan to travel during the peak seasons which are usually Spring and Autumn.",

There were 6 of us, 2 with Singapore passports and 4 with Malaysian passports (all PRs). My son had a tube with a fishing rod to check in. After issuing the boarding passes came the surprises. First they asked for proof of residence in Singapore for the MY passport holders. 3 of us carried our SG ICs with us and had no issue. My daughter just had her SG driving licence. To them that was not good enough and we had to wait for a good 30mins while they 'checked'. They came back with the most ridiculous reason from their counterpart in Singapore....\"sometimes the immigration in SG stops people who cannot provide residence status!\" If only they checked the ICA site they would have realised no visa is required, if that is what they were after. We settled that by signing an indemnity of some sort, a CYA for their comfort. Then came the next surprise....the tube with the fishing rod exceeds 'dimensions' (203cm instead of max 183cm) and my son had to pay S$140 to get it loaded! Never had he ever experienced such an instance even on budget airlines where he carted his fishing tube, e.g. Tiger, Scoot and Air Asia. \nSo, people with fishing gear, esp. tubes be careful and opt for other airlines. For PRs just carry your SG IC with you. \nJAL behaved worst than a low cost airline and this is the first and last time we fly JAL.",

The seat went to a fully flat huge bed much bigger than that of British Airways.",

There seemed to be a little more legroom and the seats were comfortable. The entertainment system was definitely an upgrade from the American flight. The food was quite nice and there was plenty to eat. We got two meals on this 8 hour flight. Beverage service was pretty normal and you could get alcohol if you paid for it. The flight attendants were helpful and courteous. JAL is now an Alaska Airlines partner so there is one more reason to fly with them in the future. I had left an item on the aircraft and it was difficult to get in touch with a JAL representative at the Jakarta Airport. Never did get the item back but that was not their fault.",

I won't say which seats we had ( I don't won't everybody booking them,but seatguru listed them as bad, . They were the best seats we've ever had. All economy seats have extra width and pitch compared with any other economy seat I've ever sat in, USB socket, power supply below seat and nifty drink holders, cubbies and folding tables.\n The films were up to date, the food was very good and self service snacks and drinks were available throughout the flight. The toilets were clean and were cleaned during the flight and a few toothbrushes were put out near the end of the flight.\n The cabin crew were excellent and were so charming and attentive both the Japenese crew and the English/Irish crew.\n Would I fly JAL again, you bet I would!",

If you like to sit together you are better to choose the middle two suites.   We decided to have window seats behind each other and the space is very good as is the lie flat bed.  The entertainment on offer isn't really extensive enough - there were a few recent movies but generally the choice is poor.\nThe dinner was very similar to that offered in Business Class but the breakfast is more hard core Japanese style, not an egg in sight and we found the choice completely undesirable.  We just had coffee and fruit.\nI would not travel or pay to go First Class again.  The new Business class seats all have aisle access and the breakfast choices are far better. They provide everything a traveller would want - privacy, space, decent seats, a lie flat bed, decent food choices and a reasonable price.",

The timing of lunch is questionable as most passengers have just enjoyed breakfast in the Qantas lounge in Sydney.  There is no JAL lounge. Japanese and Western cuisines are offered.   The Western choices always include fish, beef and chicken but not a vegetarian option.  The presentation and level of service is excellent.  Each meal is delivered individually, not on a trolley.  However this all happens between 0930 and 1030 and I'm never ready for lunch at this time.  The entertainment is reasonable but latest movies are limited.  Before landing at Narita a snack is offered although a snack menu is available all day consisting of three types of Japanese noodles and other offerings.  \nWhat sells this service to me is the timing of the service, the reliability of the schedule and the graciousness of the service. Leaving first thing in the morning and arriving just after 1700 makes for a comfortable journey or stopover if you're travelling onwards.  I'd give it another star if they moved lunch back 2 hours.",

To make things worse, I found out in Tokyo airport that the airline charged me twice on my booking! I found out when I was purchasing something that my card was declined and so I wondered why, and my bank told me I had 4 tickets from Manila-Tokyo-Chicago-Atlanta charged to me! As a result, I had to pay the hotel cash and I couldn't use Uber while in Atlanta. They have inconvenienced me big time so I don't think I will ever fly again with Japan Airlines. The only saving grace they had was the co-flight with American Airlines. The food was good and their service was better. It took them more than a week to return my money...and it was almost $4,000!",

On connecting flights from Tokyo to the US JAL was partnered with American Airlines and despite their limitations in assisting me with American Airlines flight changes, they were very apologetic and tried everything they could to assist me. I found it so amusing that JAL employees were more concerned about helping me than any of the American Airlines employees. For me it reinforces the belief that Japanese companies truly put the customer first in theory AND practice unlike many US companies. I own the bias in this, and I am open to continue being open to US companies proving me wrong.",

One hour of stress and running around the airport for , finally being  approved to get on the flight with a warning I might have problems elsewhere. I did not: passed through 9 countries with no problem. Aus passport have electronic chip. My passport was in  its 10th year of usage and it  had its wear and tear. Now I have a new passport.\n\nTickets are good value for money.   Japanese stile food/ NZ wine is mostly  amazing in business class,  staff is very polite. Re food I say \"mostly\"  as on my last return flight from Tokyo to Sydney (flight 771) dinner served had too much of hot stuff in  it. It is funny that this happened: on my way to Europe I was giving compliments to the chefs! Food was simply divine.\n\n Seats and  space in Dreamliner are great. I would not  choose seat close to food prep area: it is a bit noisy.\n\nThere are 3 or 4 lounges to choose at the  Narita airport: one of them, near gate 70+,  is large on 2 levels, have showers, space for smokers, non smokers,  beds to sleep/ rest and more. They prepare cooked food as well as snacks. One of the best lounges if you have plenty of time between flights.",

On the other hand the airline handled my daughters peanut allergy extremely well and we were very happy with their care and her variety of food.  Japan Airlines seems to have more legroom than other airlines I have flown with which was great.  Bathrooms were well maintained.

A daylight flight to Tokyo followed by another daylight flight to London after a nights sleepover and an afternoon arrival makes it much easier to cope with jet lag.  Whilst the PE service in flight is 'normal' JAL provides express customs and lounge access.  We also like the fact that for about A$900 ea, we can fly back in business with their excellent lie flat beds for the London/Tokyo leg (sadly only angled flat for NRT/SYD) for the night flights",

        "review_text": "There is no direct flight from Singapore to Shikoku yet. My own preference is JAL, as it has always been known to be prompt. \nI book directly on the JAL Singapore website. JAL or ANA offers many flights to Shikoku, but usually the transit in Tokyo is from Narita to Haneda or vice-versa. However, whichever airline you choose, there is a major consideration when transiting in Tokyo : I never like to have to transit from Tokyo Haneda to Tokyo Narita airport(or vice-versa) just for the domestic flight. It's quite troublesome. There are unfortunately very few JAL or ANA flights whose transit airport is the same.\nFor the outbound flight, the transit at Haneda is a bit more problematic. You have to pick up your luggage and proceed quickly to the domestic counter to drop them off. Here, I find that the domestic counter staff is pretty slow in handling the queue. Then you have to take a bus at the bus shuttle area to the domestic terminal. The bus leaves every 20 minutes (the interval is a bit long). Then once at the domestic terminal, you may have to take a long walk to the gate. Our transit time was less than 2 hrs, so it was a bit rushed. We were the last to board the flight.\nFor the inbound flight, our luggage is automatically transferred to the international flight. But we had to ask where to take the bus to the international terminal. At the bus stop area, there is a big automated machine screen telling you the destination of the incoming bus. Take only the bus for the international terminal. The bus leaves every 6-8 minutes, so that's good.\nOur transit time was 2h30 minutes, but we had plenty of time to shop at the Airport Duty-Free area.\nAll in all, a smooth flight. The flight meals are average and note that there are no meals onboard the domestic flight. The JAL counter staff are very friendly and helpful.",

In fact, it was so much cheaper than the flights to Seattle, which was my actual destination, that it made sense to fly to Vancouver and take the train down. That was a delight in itself. I think I'll make a habit of flying this way. Oh, and since there was a long layover, they provided a free room in a decent hotel near the airport. Highly recommended.",

The in-flight staff was so friendly, helpful and offered some delicious food which I chose to have in Japanese style. Most amazing thing which I saw was they treated every passenger specially, as if they were personally known to them. As I've experienced by living in Japan, everything inside the flight was so clean and neat. I have only traveled in their Business Class for couple of times and the experience I had was top in it's class. I recommend JAL to anyone without a second thought and would love to travel with them again!",

It's not bothersome at all.\nWindows - it darkens when it's sunny and clear when it's dark. My comment as well as what I've heard from others is that it doesn't get dark enough that it's still bright. Sometimes hard to sleep.\nFood - they filled up the tray and lots of food. FLight attendants going around with Ice cream, coffe and tea . Snacks every 2 hours or so.\nSeat - the seat pitch, width and legroom is comparable to what Delta sells as Economy Plus.

My ultimate destination was London.\n\nThe Premium Economy cabin was quiet and the seats were just great--very comfortable--and there was plenty of room for me to stretch my legs out. One of the reasons I avoid travelling in Economy is that, at the age of 74, my knees are not what they were, and sitting with them flexed for hours is intolerable.\n\nI believe the food was the same as Economy, but I had no complaints on that score. I liked the Japanese-style snacks that came with drinks--yummy soy beans, for example.\n\nService was impeccable from smiling flight attendants.\n\nI can't comment about the entertainment because I was reading something engrossing. All I watched was the little aeroplane on the flight path display.\n\nMy overall impression of JAL was very favourable and I shall certainly consider flying with them again.",

Check in was a breeze - staff exceptionally friendly / polite.  Lounge in Vancouver does not belong to JAL and it's pretty basic / crowded (Plaza Premium Lounge).  Seating in JAL business class on the 787-8 Dreamliner is 2-2-2 versus most other carriers at 1-2-1.  The extra two seats come at the expense of seat width.  Legroom is all you need. The seats flatten but when fully reclined are at a very slight downward angle toward feet.  Not a big deal, but not flat flat either.  \nService was very good although the food not close to other carrier's offerings. Again, ultra polite staff and very responsive.\nThe lounge in Narita was excellent - we had a two and a half hour layover which was plenty of time to grab a quick shower to wash off the airplane stink.\nFrom Narita to Hanoi, we were on a 787-9 series which has these little compartments - true lay flat seats and you could exit from the window seat without climbing over the aisle seat - again the 2-2-2 seating made for tighter quarters but if you were a big person (in circumference), you might want to stick with an aisle seat.  JAL uses another private lounge in HCM City which was adequate / quiet.  Overall, we got great value and have booked them for two more upcoming trips to SE Asia in the next 6 months.",

The flight arrives around 5.00 PM in Narita which is peak hour which can be an issue. if you are flying out on JAL within 24 hours they will also provide accommodation in Narita.",

It used to be that it was cheaper because of lesser cabin fit out but now they have comfortable lie flat beds and a nicer fit out compared to Qantas.\nThe real clinchers for Jal are: service - nothing is too much trouble ever; cleanliness - my husband thinks they clean the toilets after every visitor - never water or litter in their toilets; and, food. The food is fabulous but mainly the Japanese food - my daughter was taking photos of the food all the time. The do regular meal times will hold food over for you or there's all flight snacks - an absolute must is the miso ramen!\nSmall niggle is that they want the cabin organised for landing a bit early which was a bit of a pest on the return overnight flight.\nOne thing you must do is wear lightweight clothing as they tend to run the air conditioning a bit on the warm side.",

We make this trip every 12-16 months and have used many different airlines and have found JAL to be the best for our purposes - besides it gives us mileage with American Airlines. Having been fed up with the cramped conditions in economy, we decided to give the premium a try. The cost was a little less than double that of regular economy. I don't know how the other companies do it, but the extra seating space made what was a 13 hour torture session almost enjoyable. Besides that, the little extras in the snack and beverage departments were very good. As usual, the JAL flight crew was outstanding and extremely accommodating. Another advantage was that this ticket gains you entrance to the airport clubs normally used by first and business class passengers.I know this has been more about the ticket than the airline, but JAL really needs no superlatives from me.",

I chose the Japanese, which was largely sea food, some which was a bit dry/over cooked, However the Salon Champagne and Sake were top notch. Would also recommend trying Queen of the Blue tea, a rare treat. The English movie selection was very limited, just enough for a 9 hour flight.  However the view out the window of the Great Barrier Reef and other islands made up for this. \n\nThe highlight of the trip was the lovely flight attendants - they were attentive and friendly but never too intrusive.

The attendants were pleasant, helpful and always had a smile.  The Premium Economy is well worth the extra money spent especially for a 23+ hour flight.  No complaints about comfort at all.  I was also very pleased that I was able to book a seat assignment at the time of purchase of my ticket unlike another Asian airline I took to Thailand.  No one wants to get stuck with a seat that doesn't suit their needs when traveling for nearly 40 hours in total.  That would be a complete nightmare!\n\nCONS:  The food!  OMG.... the food! (face palm).  Let's just start with, that it was totally inedible.  It all looked and tasted like it was made of plastic and came out of a mold.  I'm also vegetarian but that doesn't stop me from picking pieces out here and there in between the food that I can't eat especially when I have no control over my environment.  THERE IS NO VEGETARIAN OPTION anywhere for you to choose from, either when booking the flight or while in flight.  It simply does not exist.  So people with ANY food restrictions are completely screwed.  You get what they have which is two meat options, and that is it.  If you are a Celiac, your screwed, diabetic, your screwed, vegetarian, your screwed.  I tried to eat the \"fruit\" cup but it had a weird taste, like rubbery gelatin plastic, so that wasn't an option either.  For the nearly 40 hours it took to get to Hanoi from Sand Diego.... all I ate was bread (and butter which I don't normally eat but I was starving!!!).  Why didn't I bring snacks you ask?  I did, and over 40 hours they went quickly.\n\nMy second complaint:  The in flight movie options are at least 3-5 years old.  That totally sucks on really really long flights.\n\nWould I fly them again?  Probably, with hesitation.  I would look to find other available flights first and if I had no other choice, I would fly JAL again but bring with me a full backpack full of food items!",

The entertainment was excellent, as there was a good selection of movies, music, shows and games. \n\nThe windows of the plan have a dimming feature, so you can choose to have the window open without all the sunlight blinding you. That was great! \n\nThe food was very good for plane food. They fed me so much. Almost too much but that's not a complaint ever!! Blankets, pillows and headphones were all provided. \n\nThe flight itself didn't have much turbulence at all, and the landing was smooth. \n\nHighly recommended airline!",

It was a fairly large plane so I am assuming there weren't that many rows of seats in the economy section because there was so much space between each row. It's so out of the ordinary that an airline gives you that much space and being 6ft 3in I instantly took notice. I was seating towards the back of the plane since the upgrade was $300 bucks. Anyway, it was a welcomed surprised. The food was not too bad and the flight attendants were great. The return flight though was more like the usual \"pack them like sardines\" type. I am assuming the nice spacious flights are only going to Japan and not returning. Either way, the service was something that stood out, no complaints there! \n\nJAL check-in service sucks and lacks behind other major airlines. The portal is antiquated and it can be confusing even having all your information it's hard to maneuver around the site. The translation of the Japanese site to the English site is definitely the culprit. This part of the service definitely needs to improve ten fold. I had a transfer in Osaka on my return, but the first flight wasn't available to check in at the site and no further information on the flight was provided. I had to go to Terminal 3 at Narita and figure out which airline was handling the national flight for JAL as that information wasn't provided by JAL's portal.",

The food is yummy.  It's a nice eclectic Japanese fair.  There is a lot of it too.  I counted 8 different items for one meal.  Their rice crackers are good too.  I really just can't say enough about how great JAL is.  This is my 2nd time to fly with them and both times have been great.",

        "review_text": "My wife and I booked this flight with American Airlines miles.  The first leg, Bangkok to Haneda Airport in Tokyo, was on a regional 777.  As such, the business class seat was not lie flat, although as a daytime flight, this wasn't critical.  The seat was comfortable and the food was quite good, as we both had the Japanese meal.  I should also note that business class passengers in Bangkok get to use a separate entrance into the immigration and security check, one that is much less hectic than that used by economy passengers.  It was a nice respite from the chaos that is Bangkok's departure area from mid-morning to mid-afternoon, when we have been in a line an hour long.  The entire process in the business class line was about 10 minutes.\n\nTransit at Haneda was very simple, just an escalator up one floor and the gate was right there.  Our layover was about 7 hours (arrived around 5PM, well ahead of schedule and departed at just after midnight).  There was probably time for us to sneak into Tokyo for dinner, but as this was our first time at Haneda, we decided not to risk it.  We found a good sushi stand inside the airport (reviewed separately) and had a very nice meal there at not too high a price, given that it was in the airport.  The Sakura Lounge at Haneda was quite comfortable and had good WiFi service, so the time there went by quite quickly.\n\nThe flight from Haneda to SFO was on a 777-300ER, the elite bird of JAL.  Business class is set up in a 2-3-2 configuration.  However, the seats are very private.  My wife and I had two of the middle seats, with her seat being in the exact center and mine being on the aisle.  The seats were in the small mini-cabin directly behind first class, so there is only a single row there, meaning there was a lot of privacy.  My wife, who can be claustrophobic at times, had no such complaints, even in the middle seat.  The seats were fully lie flat and I would have to say were about the most comfortable seats I've ever been in.  I've only had one other business class experience and that was on EVA in a 1-2-1 configuration.  The seat there was nice, but this was great.  I'm 6'2\" tall and had plenty of legroom.  I also had sufficient body room and didn't have to contort myself into any strange positions in order to lay flat.\n\nIt was about a nine hour flight and we both slept for at least six hours, a first for both of us.  I have read some complaints that JAL keeps their cabins too hot, but we didn't experience that.  We didn't need the blanket, but neither did we find it too warm.\n\nBeing a red-eye flight that left at midnight, there is only one formal meal and that's about two hours before landing in SFO.  We each selected the traditional Japanese breakfast and I found it very good.\n\nThe only demerit I can give JAL is the in-flight entertainment.  On both flights, it was pretty blah, with not very many selections.  But at least on the HAN-SFO leg of the flight, I didn't care because I slept so soundly.\n\nWe will be taking a repeat trip on JAL in December, when we return from Singapore to SFO (also on an AA business class award ticket).  The main difference will be that JAL has changed the schedule so instead of a midnight flight, we leave in the early evening.  Unfortunately, we had to change our flight going to Singapore to Cathay Pacific because the new flight times meant we would either arrive in Singapore very , very late, or that we would have to have an overnight at the airport, neither of which was palatable.\n\nIn summary, I'd highly recommend JAL, particularly for its transpacific flight.",

We had the same experience when traveling years ago when our eldest was an infant and toddler as well. Too often you hear of stories where airline staff look at travelers with small kids as a source of potential discomfort during the flight. We did not get that vibe at all from JAL staff throughout any of our trips with them.\n\nI love how they put effort into little touches to make a 14-hour flight comfortable for kids, such as allowing them to pick between a coloring pack or a small plastic model jetliner at the beginning of the flight, and having kid-specific meals on the menu, to kid-friendly content on their in-flight entertainment program (Street Fighter and cartoons always work).\n\nThe food on the JAL flights into Narita and from there to Manila is always good, especially for folks who travel on economy like we do. There's always a small salad, a protein and carb (typically Japanese themed), some miso soup (if so desired), some green tea or coffee, and some Haagen-Dazs ice cream for dessert. Our kids definitely enjoy the ice cream!\n\nNeedless to say, we're fans of JAL, both from a price perspective and an in-flight experience angle. We highly recommend them!",

Unfortunately with the BA booking code one is unable to manage his flight on the JL website. I had to investigate to figure out the JL resevation code. Once I had it, I was shocked to realise that the two of us (in spite of both of us being Sapphire) were seated separately.  When I tried to change the seats it was impossibel. I have never seen such a bad and unfriendly website. Shame on Japan Airlines.   We were also unable to check.in online, so we had to go to teh airport early. At the airport we were checked in swiftly and got an invitation to the lounge. What shall I say, appart from the view, the lounge was so poor and the design was afwul. No food, and very limited selection of drinks. Well below the average of the other OneWorld airlines' lounges.   To my great surprise when we entered the plane, there were many seats empty even at the windows and I can npt understand why these seats were not shown on the websites?!!!  When I say plenty I mean at least 100 seats!!!!.  The flight was short and fine, nothing extra. The staff was nice, but not very friendly. Very average.",

Unfortunately our flight from Kagoshima was delayed due to weather which would require we overnight & catch a flight later the next day.  Technically we could have done this but one day on the island was not very appealing & we worried the bad weather could continue.  Our tickets were totally non refundable.  The agents at Japan Airlines in Kagoshima were amazing.  They agreed to refund our ticket to Yakushima in full, then rebook us to Osaka that evening at no additional cost.  And they called our hotel in Yakushima & our car rental to cancel. They turned a big disappointment into a very positive experience.  Thank you.",

The JAL economy seat is superior to many Premium Economy seats on other airlines. Plenty of leg room, I'm 5'10 and could still see my toes with my leg stretch straight. Service was great as always like many other asian airlines. Food and entertainment system was on par or better than other airlines. After flying with JAL economy, I have decided to continue to fly on economy in the future and put my savings elsewhere. If JAL can offer such great product, there's no reason for other airlines not to do so. I guess there's a reason why JAL economy is ranked in the top 5 on Skytrax. \n\nThe only complaint I have is the onboard temperature. JAl likes to set it's a/c temperature slightly higher than other airlines, so I strongly suggest passengers to wear short sleeves on the flight. \n\nHowever, JAL has not updated all their planes with these wider economy seats, so make sure to verify when booking.",

Being able to walk around a bit and/or stretch is nice.\nOn earlier ANA flights (and Qatar many years ago) they were kind enough to allow a few of us to quietly stand near the back looking out the rear window went a long way to relieving strain/pain.\nGuess JAL does not believe it allowing that. However, what I noticed the most was the difference between how this was communicated by Japanese (I assume) crew and the crews that seemed to be manned by more western folk (like me). This difference carried throughout all interactions.\nThe difference in politeness was frightening, sobering, and (until I steeled myself to it on the return) aggravating.\nHad forgotten all of this until I just got the notice that TripAdvisor was adding airlines. Happy to share this - they didn't seem to mind how they treated me and I am happy to return the favor.

Some airports are fine (Birmingham) some just awful (Heathrow) and some just too far from anywhere (Narita). \nSo, I think the best compromise is JAL from T3  (yuck) to Haneda (yeah!). The new JAL economy seats are ok, the service is fine and the food is mixed (their UK based caterers are poor and their Japan based caters very good) so you might want to take some sardines with you for the outbound flight.\nHowever, for a fee you can upgrade to Premium Economy and get some extra legroom, extra elbow room, and access to a Washlet (toilet with a bidet). The PE area seemed quieter than back in Economy so you've got more of a chance of a pill-free sleep AND at Haneda you can escape from the masses by using their Premium Economy checkin queue and retreat to their Sakura lounge - which was OK (not Great... just OK but it did have those fancy Washlets)",

        "review_text": "A flew with JAL code-sharing. From Budapest to London it was British Airways, from London to Tokyo it was Japanese Airlines. It was the third flight in my life and first with Japanese Airlines. I and my girlfriend already had experience with British Airways, Alitalia, Lufthansa, KLM and Airfrance. JAL is so far the best ever.\n\nThe legroom is big enough, the chairs are also big too. I'm not a small men, (180 cm 90 kg) so it was a miracle to have enough place. I've never felt it before.\n\nThe cabin attendants were extremly kind and they were smiling all the time. Whatever i asked they answered kindly not like at the other air companies above. \n\nThe plane was really clean and the service was amazing. This is what I was expecting from a Japanese company. Even the foreign cabin attendants treated us and and worked like the Japanese staff. \n\nThe food was brilliant. The amount was enough, we got several meals (like in Japan) and everything was high quality and unbeleivable tasty. We could choose western and Japanese style meal. Both we asked for Japanese style. It was the tastiest meal what i have ever eaten on board. The dessert was also amazing. We got H\u00e4agen-Dazs icecream twice and Japanese puding, jelly, seasonal fruits and sweets.\n\nOther good points:\n\n- Variation of drinks and snacks (Western and Japanese snacks (2-3X times more kinds than in the other air companies, Umeshu (japanese \u201eplum\u201d wine), many kinds of tea (true green tea, barley tea etc..)\n- Fast checkin\n- Free foreign magazines and books in the lobby\n- No delay (even 1 minute)\n- Very interesting games and films (even brend new films)\n- High tech remote controller\n- Price: In my opinion JAL beats all of the european air companies easily. The only air company which is close to JAL is Lufthansa, but if you buy a ticket in a good time, it can as cheap as Alitalia or Finnair.",

The JAL was completely lie flat and included an ergonomic mattress in the overhead bin that you could use at your discretion.  It also included a special ergonomic pillow.  The AA seat included a low def seat back screen, perhaps 10 inches in size.  The JAL included a 22 or 23 inch (I don't remember which) high def screen at each seat.  The food options were better and could be ordered at any time during the flight via a small touch screen remote at your seat.\n\nThere's all kinds of little differences.  It's the attention to detail that makes you realize how much better other airlines are.",

Even the cross keys concierge at the Mandarin Oriental could not check my husband in and print his boarding pass although she did so for me without any problem.  So we arrived at the airport a little bit early.  The counter clerk was able to check my husband in efficiently.  Another employee actually escorted us to the First Class lounge although it wasn't hard to find and we don't need any assistance.  The lounge itself has both a sushi bar and a saki bar, two of my favorite things.  On multiple trips to each I realized I was the only woman in the lounge who was not a JAL employee.  That changed slightly as our flight time neared, but clearly most JAL first class passengers are male.  Our flight left a little bit late, but made up the time before arrival.  First class was so comfortable, but then so was the business class we flew going over.  In fact, had I known how good the business class was, I would have saved some FFM's and flown business class back.  I have a new favorite airline!  (I'm not rating the in-flight entertainment because I read my Kindle, ate their wonderful food and slept for hours.)",

We chose JAL because we are in the One World Alliance and our primary carrier American does not have a non-stop flight to Osaka, where our tour was starting.  JAL knew several hours before that our flight would be delayed because of a problem on the incoming flight.  They sent us two emails and phoned us to let us know so that we could avoid arriving at the airport too early.  The flight itself was lovely.  Although the business class seats were not marketed as flatbed, with a little fiddling with the controls I was able to make the seat into a flatbed.  That and the quiet atmosphere along with what I assume is a good air circulation system allowed me to get several hours of sleep, something I find difficult to do on most flights.  The food was very tasty with choices of western or Japanese for all meals.  I hope to travel to Japan again and if I do, I hope I can fly JAL.",

They were always ready with a smile, making it a fun experience for both of us.

The staff is overly attentive and friendly and keeps on bowing in the Japanese way, even if they are Thais.

The new lie-flat seat is a huge improvement over the original angle-flat seats JAL installed on these planes. Everyone has their own little cubicle and their own direct aisle access. There's a sliding partition between the seats that you can lower if you'd like to chat with your neighbor. \n\nThe food looks a bit like an ekiben train station bento when it comes out, but it's several notches tastier. I appreciated that you could eat more quickly than if they'd brought all of those little things out one at a time. Everything was delicious and served with care.\n\nThe video system was great, it has a smartphone-like remote control that was easy to use. There was more than enough programming to keep us both busy for the duration of the flight. They also have in-flight Wi-Fi provided by T-mobile: $18.80 for the whole flight, $14.40 for 3 hours, or $10.15 for one hour.\n\nThey have turn-down service with mattress pads and duvets. They don't offer full pajamas, unfortunately, just a cardigan top. Love the self-serve bar and the midnight snack menu.\n\nWould happily take this flight again!",

I have to stress again how happy we were with the staff, they genuinely appeared to enjoy their job and were in great spirits.  This was a 7 hour flight so there were 2 meals and a snack served.  The food was still airplane food, so not that great, but it was far better than any other we've experienced.  The breakfast was extremely edible featuring yogurt, fruit, and an omelette.  I can't recall the other meal but it was edible too.  The snack was raw smoked salmon on croissant (gross!) but I got some rice crackers instead.  There was a blanket and pillow (standard on long flights) but they were much nicer than other airlines, with a decent pillow case and a thick, big blanket (I took mine home for my next AA flight!).  I had a couple of beers (no charge, nice!) as well.  All in all it was a great flight, the airplane was very clean and the in-flight entertainment had a great variety.  Screens were big.  Also to note, the pitch and seat size are bigger than those junk AA flights!\n\nBoarding was great as well, unlike other airlines, JAL boards from the rear of the plane, making it much easier to get in and there aren't people constantly walking over you to get to their seats.",

        "review_text": "The in-flight experience was simply excellent.  From the time I walked into the cabin until I deplaned, the flight attendants were very courteous, friendly, and attentive.  The seat pods were spacious and very comfortable.  The beverage and meal selections were also very meticulously prepared.  It's as if I was dining in a Michelin starred restaurant.\n\nThe only down side to my trip was the customer service on the ground.  I had a flight cancellation due to weather (massive snow storm in New York City, my original destination).  Per the rules, they don't have to re-accommodate me on another airline.  ANA's flight to JFK was not cancelled and had availability in first class but JAL refused to put me on that flight (which is well within the rules).  JAL's next flight with availability was 3 days later.  They offered to fly me to LAX and then asked that I work with American Airlines once I get to LAX for an onward flight to JFK.  When I got to LAX, American Airlines informed me that JAL has not endorsed my ticket over to them.  When I went back to JAL to explain this, they informed that they have.  Seeing that the fully-booked JFK flight was leaving soon, I opted to purchase the ticket instead of waiting on JAL and American Airlines to figure out the error.\n\nJAL was well within their rights to follow the rules.  However, this is what sets apart the very good carriers from the excellent ones.  I've had similar situations with Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific and they have yet to \"follow the rules\" during those situations.  They understood readily that they want to make things right if it was at all possible.",

Small minus is the seat. It was bit hard and the actual seat very short. So for guys sized as me (180cm) my legs got numb because I didn't had decent leg support from the seat. Other negative thing was pricing of the onboard WIFI. With those prices (18,80$/person) only person using the WIFI is the guy whom employer pays it. But all in all, I can recommend flying with JAL.",

I do have anime on my laptop so I watched it there instead, so not a big issue but would be nice for this not to be necessary.",

        "type_of_route": "International",
        "review_text": "Four experiences on JAL. Service is consistently outstanding but the overall experience varies considerably:\n\n777 w/ Sky Wider. Excellent.  \n34 inches of pitch, 18.5+ seat width and a 2-4-2 configuration make this one of the best economy seating/cabin experiences out there. Clean refurbished interior. The small seatback cubbin is perfect for charging an iphone, the USB port being right below it. \n\nSeat cushion gets uncomfortably hard after 3-4 hours, however (remember, some of these flights are 12 hours+).\n\nNice, clear large seatback video monitor. AVOD maps function was useful but movie/game/info choices are monotonous and poor quality.\n\nIt is especially pleasant that these seats have very limited recline- there is little noticeable intrusion into one's personal space from a surprise recline by the person sitting in front.\n\nPlenty of overhead bin space in this aircraft, too.\n\nService was outstanding- 2 hot towel services, 2 full meals, another snack meal and at least 3 beverage services on the way over was plenty from a service standpoint.  Flight crew professional, courteous and responsive. Peculiarly, the captain does little communicating with passengers, compared to American carriers, at least.\n\nMeal quality was okay-to-good on two occasions, almost tasteless on the third. Snacks are bland, insubstantial, and probably will upset your stomach over a long haul flight.\n\n767 NON Sky Wider. Good.\n\nThe 2-3-2 seat configuration on this aircraft makes for a comfortable cabin feeling.\n\nSeats have just enough pitch for comfort (33\"?) but are made uncomfortable when the person in front reclines. The recline is such it restricts access to your tray table and makes it very difficult to get up and go the lavatory.\n\nAVOD okay overall, but not great in terms of quality options, screen clarity or ease-of-navigation. \n\nAnnoying power box restricts leg comfort, at least in the window seats.\n\nService outstanding again and one meal service plus two beverage services is plenty for a four hour flight.\n\nBut the food was pretty much tasteless, or tasteless with vinegar added. Snacks not very tasty and will probably upset your stomach.\n\n787 NON SKY Wider. Okay.\n\nThe \"Dreamliner\" has larger windows and a window tint adjustment that is helpful. The latter takes some getting used to as the controls are on a delayed response and operate somewhat counter-intuitively. I wonder if the control function will eventually break or fall into disuse.\n\nThe circulated cabin air does seem to be fresher in the 787, and the lavatories are larger and more pleasant than typical.\n\nThe seat pitch is not quite enough. With deep seat reclines by the person in front, it  will knock food off your tray table when the person suddenly reclines in front of you. AVOD screen quality okay, movie, game, info selections seemed of low quality or canned though.\n\nFood okay, but not really tasty. Snacks dry and salty, will probably upset your stomach.\n\nCabin was clean but I noticed seat upholstery coming apart on the seat in front of me.\n\n787 SKY Wider. Good.\n\nComfortable 2-4-2 cabin seat configuration.\n\nDreamliner advantages of bigger windows, fresher air, nicer lavatories.\n\nAdequate seat pitch of 33 inches, and adequate seat width but annoying intrusion by seat recline in this aircraft. Seat cushion is inadequate, and slightly less good than in 777 SKY wider. In this aircraft, it becomes uncomfortable in 2-3 hours (so bring your own pillow).\n\nAlso the seat placement posts in this version of Sky Wider do not maximize leg room as does the 777 version. In this version, the seat post to the floor does not allow you to comfortably stretch out your legs on both sides of the seat post as does the 777.\n\nAVOD okay but map function on this version difficult to navigate and use. Great screen image quality, but again, seems like low quality choices of video.\n\nOne tasty meal, one bland tasteless meal, poor quality and insubstantial snacks. Again, likely to upset your stomach on a long haul flight of sitting.\n\nService outstanding as always.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe 777 Sky Wider is the design that needs to be copied to the other versions- very limited seat recline preserves the personal space of the passenger and allows him to get out to go to the lavatory without incident. Maximized leg room by careful placement of the seat anchor posts and elimination of power boxes makes the seating experience comfortable on a long haul flight.\n\nAs is, upgrade the snacks and beverages and restrict seat recline to 2 inches on all versions and the overall score, a composite of four flights, moves from 3.5 to 4 stars. Pure mango juice would be a great option on routes like these, add chocolate varieties of ice cream rather than only simple vanilla, etc.\n\nApply the 777 version of Sky Wider to maximize legroom and it goes to 4.5 stars.\n\nAdd a comfortable seat cushion for a long haul flight, and Japan Airlines is 5 stars, even without consistently good meals.",

        "review_text": "1. Telephone Service:  I waited 15 to 20 minutes before speaking to anyone.  I have food allergies.  I read the menus online before leaving and realized that I was allergic to almost everything.  I spent about 30 minutes on the phone with an agent.  He was able to recommend a Hindu Vegetarian meal as my best alternative.  Although I am in no way Vegetarian, it ended up being one of the best meals that I have ever had on a flight. I also explained that I had a foot injury that made long flights difficult.  I was placed in a bulk head seat.  I could not have been happier as I was able to get up, stretch, and even use a Tens machine during my flight. This was a 45 minutes well spent with a calm, professional agent.\n\n2. Boarding Agents: Our flight from Toronto to Chicago was about an hour and 15 minuted delayed.  I had a two hour connection.  I hustled over the JAL counter at my gate.  The boarding agent was welcoming, friendly and did her best to calm everyone on my flight that had sped walked.  She ensured that I had the seat that I had requested, actually gave me a better seat, and even checked to make sure that my  luggage made it onto the JAL flight.  She told me exactly how much time I had before boarding.  Before boarding, I was assured that my luggage had made the flight.\n\nI will say that in Japan, at NRT, they were very strict on the weight limit. I was about a kilo over and had to repack. I thought that was a bit harsh. After repacking stuff into my carry-on, I was then somehow 2 kilos over with my carry-on, which they actually weighed.  I complained that this was unreasonable (it took up about 45 minutes of my time), and they let it go.I think it is because I made the boarding agent lift my suitcase...it was almost her height, and I thought that she was going to tip over.\n\n3. Flight Attendants:  I have never seen flight attendants that keep the same level of professionalism, attention to detail, and courtesy throughout an entire flight.  They never looked jaded and looked genuinely happy to be working in their jobs.  I loved the safety presentation - it was graceful and introduced me to the bowing culture. Every flight attendant made it a point to say goodbye to everyone as they were leaving deplaining.  As my foot condition was listed in the Passenger Information List, they checked on me almost every two hours to make sure that I was OK and did not require help.  They were also very efficient in terms of getting drinks or snacks to you.  A wait of no more than 3 minutes tops.  I was incredibly impressed with the calmness they demonstrated with my grumpy elderly neighbour that did not want to stow her bags in the overhead compartment.  They managed to calm her down without grabbing her bags or raising their voices.\n\n4. Seats - the seats in economy are ergonomic.  There is a great neck pillow/lumbar support pillow that supports your neck and back very well.  I sat at the bulkhead, so I cannot comment on the spacing in a normal seat.  But, the bulkhead is fabulous and on my flight, no one bothered to walk across in front of our row.\n\n5. Food - If you have any sort of allergy to seafood or fish. make sure that you order a special meal.  On the way down, I had the Hindu vegetarian meal.  It actually did not taste like plain food and was completely satisfying.  The only thing that was not is the fact that I was not allowed to have a Haggen Dazs ice cream because I ordered a non-dairy meal.  I tried to explain that I was not Hindu and was not allergic to dairy, but that was lost in translation.  \n\nOn the way back, from Tokyo-Narita to Boston, I did not order a special meal as \"Hamburg steak\" was listed as the meal.  Hamburg steak is actually not beef, but a chicken patty, sort of, with pieces of seafood in it served with rice that also has seafood in it.  Luckily, I ate in Narita 2 hours before boarding as I could not eat any  of that meal (even the salad had bonito flakes and shrimp I think).  The snack was a beef noodle box, which only had a packet of seafood something to add if desired.  My other gripe is that the sake brand on JAL is awful and the coffee is borderline non-consumable.  Stick to the green tea or juice on JAL.\n\n6. In-flight entertainment:  This was the only thing that was not good.  The English movies are limited.  On the way down, the movies were from 4-5 years ago.  The music was also fairly dated.  On the way back from NRT to Boston, there was a much better selection of recent movies and slightly better music.  I found that strange as the plane from O'Hare to NRT was actually newer.  The system is not that intuitive to use.  It took me about 15 minutes to get to English movies.  I pressed a whole bunch of buttons and eventually found it. If you have a DVD or Ipad (and any sort of Ipod or Walkman), I recommend bringing it for JAL flights.\n\nBaggage Claim - this was also surprisingly efficient.  I don't recall waiting more than 10 minutes.\n\n7. Connecting Flights - I connected from NRT to a ITM (Osaka). The boarding agents realized that I could make the early flight, advised me of this, and bumped me up.  So, instead of having to endure a 4 hour layover, I was out of Tokyo an hour later.  The plane from Tokyo to Osaka-ITM was an old school Boeing plane out of the 80s.  If was clean, but definitely looked shabby.  Drinks were served as was some wonderfully delicious candy on the way out. I was so tired that I did not observe anything else on that flight.\n\n8. Check-In and JAL points - You can check in 2 to 3 days before your flight.  If you sign up for a JAL points card, the check in is a lot faster.",

        "review_text": "We'd been to Europe twice before with other carriers, flying Economy Class. This time we decided to use JAL Business Class, and we are so pleased that we did so! The \"Sky-Suite\" cubicle-style seats, used on the 777-300's on the Sydney-Tokyo route, and on the 787-8's and 787-9's on the Tokyo-Paris/Frankfurt routes give you comfort you might expect of 1st class in many airlines. \nThe ability to fully recline the seat into a completely flat bed, with a comfortable mattress, pillow and blanket, in the semi-privacy of a cubicle means that you can get a really good sleep and arrive feeling refreshed. On our return from our final destination, London, we did the entire trip to Sydney via Frankfurt and Tokyo with no stopovers, except for the few hours between flights, and yet we were still in reasonably good \"shape\" when we finally stepped off the plane. You couldn't do that with economy class! The \"Sky-Suite\" is a great concept, with its 24\" TV monitor and numerous storage compartments and large stowable table. \nMy wife, who normally hates flying because of the cramped conditions and inability to sleep, was full of praise for JAL's Business Class and said she would be very happy to fly to internationally with them again. \nWe loved the food too! When does anyone say that about an airline? The meals we ate aboard were of wonderful quality and imagination. We generally ordered the Japanese choices and were treated to imaginative cuisine better than you would eat in most Japanese restaurants. Food service was sensibly timed too. A large and leisurely main meal about 1 hour after take-off, then you could order a wide range of other foods during the flight on a casual basis. \nThe Cabin staff were just wonderful. They were incredibly attentive, always ready with a smile and very caring. Nothing was ever too much trouble for them! JAL can be congratulated on the standards of service their staff deliver, which I would rate as being of the highest order! The ground staff and Lounge staff were all superb too! We watched baggage being loaded into JAL aircraft, and were really impressed at the deliberation and care shown in the way it was handled. The aviation of the flight too was perfect. The aircraft was well flown and landings were very smooth. We'd rate the 777-300 as being marginally better than the 787-8/9's, as the 777 seems quieter inside. We had seats 8H and 8K on all four JAL flights, so a direct comparison is possible. \nNegatives? The PA announcements in English are sometimes hard to understand. \nIt is unfortunate that the individual air vent nozzles provided for most seats are not available with the Sky-Suites. The cabin was rather hot (25-26 C) and it would have been nice to have been able to direct cool air onto one's face at times. It is a pity that the aisle seats could not have been spaced so that the storage alcoves near the passenger's head had a window at the end of them. Window seat passengers have no less than 3 windows available to them, and when belted in it is impossible for the aisle seat passenger to lean forward enough to look out the window adjacent to the partition between the seats. Minor issues though, given the excellence of the Sky-Suite concept!\nOverall - I would rate JAL as an outstanding airline, and from now on it will be our choice whenever we go overseas.",

I had some of the most delicious meals on board and the portions are also generous. The seats on the refurbished B767 aircraft operating the Singapore-Tokyo route are the best I've flown on - 34 inches seat pitch, 18 inches seat width - you can't get that on some major airlines these days! In terms of inflight entertainment systems, passengers can get to their movie after one or two ads and not five or six on the gulf carriers. Drink service is also very regular on a seven hour flight. Check-in is certainly very friendly and processional, bags are on the belt within 20 minutes after disembarking in Tokyo and Singapore. I'd put JAL down as my first choice to Japan in future.",

        "review_text": "My family of four (2 adults, 1 child and 1 one-year-old baby) travelled on Japan Airlines for the first time ever (2 international and 1 domestic flight), and we were impressed.\n\nI would definitely fly again with them - the service, food, seat comfort, entertainment and flight punctuality were on par with Singapore Airlines (my usual preferred airline for international flights), and in some ways, better.  The child meals were generally healthier, but still very tasty and beautifully presented.  The types of toys/children's souvenirs offered were more useful (I ended up collecting several of children's cutlery sets) and I particularly liked their collection of wooden toys (sadly, I didn't manage to collect all of them).  But the best thing of all was the complimentary carseat provided for the baby.  We had booked a seat for him as he is much too big to fit into a bassinet and is too fidgety to stay on a lap.  As he was under 3, Japan Airlines provided a carseat for him on all three flights (I just had to submit a request about a week before our first flight and provide a couple of measurements so they could set it up for him).  He was so comfortable and settled in the carseat that it made those three flights so much more pleasant for all of us.  The domestic flights with Qantas between Adelaide and Sydney were a nightmare in comparison.  If only other airlines would provide a similar service...\n\nWe were also impressed with their land-side service and their awesome loan strollers (at the airports in Japan) which had ample storage space for hand luggage and steered like a dream.  The loan strollers provided by the airports themselves were just ordinary umbrella strollers.\n\nThe only (mildly) annoying point was the language barrier, which resulted in some confusion when we asked whether passengers with travelling with young children had priority boarding (a sign showed that this was meant to be the case, but they weren't letting other families through).  A fellow passenger kindly translated our request into Japanese and we were allowed to board first.",

But overall, in the past years / months / days airlines trying to always seek room for improvement and Japan Airlines has improved dramatically. Comparing my last JL flight to this one, you can clearly see the improvement, but still they are a little picky about how many ice-creams are being passed onto their Business Class passengers, or \"they need to check\" if there is still bread available, which is unacceptable. If a passenger wants an ice-cream or a bread, especially in Business Class, so give him a piece of bread or an ice-cream, also, I tink you headsets belong to an Economy Class, but you do offer slippers / which is fine. Mouthwash in your lavaotories, but no actual towels, as a man with a bit of beart, you will see that you are having difficulties in drying your face, there will be paper fragments all over your face and you have to wash your face again and again. (save is waste!). Member of staff extremely friendly, but I don't think that you need to reject offering ice-cream / or more bread to a passenger. If you don't want to offer Whiskey to a passenger, simply don't write in on your menu. Please make your passengers happy and let them have a pleasant journey. Small details can make a big difference. Your airline lounges are pretty nice, your food and beverages very well prepared. You even have a locker for baggages / which is great, the passengers don't have to carry their items all around the lounge, but simply lock their belongnings, which is wonderful and extremely convenient. Will fly again, great airport, great airline, but there is better / worse. Etihad, Emirates and Qatar are setting standards and exceed expecations of passengers, but those are your rivals.",

In a nutshell while the service was good the seats were pretty average, we had exit row but felt that seats could have been better, bit wider but no real advantage reclining. Biggest bug bear was poor leg support and table tray far too small, also acute lack of storage space. On a later flight with another carrier, I booked standard economy, exit row, seat and space much better. So premium economy, with this carrier, for me no way, won't do that again, not worth the extra money.",

The airline followed procedure and interviewed my wife about my son's health, held them until the plane was empty, and then detained them further at the airport.  We understand the protocol when there is a sickness on board but they treated my family with a cold, insensitive, disrespect that left my family in tears.  The treatment JAL delivered was completely unacceptable and we will NEVER fly JAL nor will be recommend that anyone, especially families, take this uncaring airlines.

The monitor in the seat back in front of each passenger was a fabulous option, particularly since there were an enormous number of English language choices. These included numerous new Hollywood movies (Star Wars VII, The Revenant, The Big Short, The Hateful Eight, many others) as well as old standby films (the original Star Wars series, all 3 Men In Black films, many others). There were extensive options for kids as well such as kids TV and movies and video games with a controlled in the armrest. \nThe cabin attendants were incredibly pleasant. They were available and polite. One woman went out of her way to bring me my travel pillow. I left it in my seat and she tracked me down all the way in the baggage area about 1/2 hour after we had departed the plane. \nThe food was good. The kids' meals had an Asian focus and were not to our kids' tastes but were fine meals. We got the vegetarian options, which I enjoyed though my wife liked the regular meals my parents had more (pasta with meat sauce was one that was really good). Overall, the food was decent.\nI will definitely look to fly JAL if we head to Asia again (or anywhere else JAL flies) as all six of us had a really positive experience, especially given that we were on the plane for 19 hours each way between the two flights.",

All was well until we were diverted to Haneda due high winds at Narita.  They made us sit on the runway at Haneda for 4.5 hrs before flying us to Narita.  They had no food and very limited beverage service for the 6 hour delay...  turning our 7 hr scheduled flight into a 13 hr fiasco.  Upon landing, Narikta was not prepared for us and all public transportation stops during the night.  Japan Airlines did NOTHING to accommodate their customers.  Even first class customers were stranded at the airport.  Finally at 2am they handed out a bottle of water and some crackers.  The trip from Haneda, Tokyo back to Singapore was fine in terms of timing, but the aircraft was old, the seats were worn thin and extremely uncomfortable, the electronics were substandard as was the quality of the food.  Drink service was terribly slow and climate control was uncomfortable.  All in all not a good experience.",

I've flown multiple economy flights and business class flights with JAL from 2012-2015.  The amicable service varies little from business to economy class except economy receives more individualized service/luxury (seat reclines, food & drink on-demand, larger TV screen, privacy window, etc.).  Flying from LAX to NRT is not terrible in economy.  Of course, business was BETTER, but economy was remarkably better than the longhaul with Asiana from LAX to ICN.  I digress, I've flown with JAL to Japan and to Thailand from Japan.  My experience was always pleasant and I wish I flew with JAL instead of trying to save money and flying with Asiana.  If it gets down to simply pinching pennies, I would still choose JAL over other airlines.",

On this front they should learn from Emirates or Air India",

One course after another, each meal tasting like what you would find at a top restaurant in Tokyo.\nThe crew on my flight were one of the best crews I've ever had on a flight. They were so attentive.\nIn the middle of the night, I was watching a movie and a crew alerted me when the captain spotted the northern lights!\nIt is one of the most experiences of my life, to see the Northern Lights 35,000 feet in the sky, just mind blowing! wow.",

As business class passengers, we were permitted access to the one-world lounge in LAX, which was decently nice.  The seat/pod was more than roomy for me as a petite (5'3\") thin person.  A very large person might not be very comfortable.  There was plenty of storage area within the pod and in the overhead bin.  Everything looked clean and sanitary.  The bathrooms on board were always clean, and as a  person who absolutely hates these tiny bathrooms and tries not to use them, I had no problems using them frequently throughout the flight.\n\nThe amenities were typical and nice (eye mask, toothbrush, slippers, etc...) and the movie/video selections were fairly up to date and varied.\n\nThe dinner service (our flight was before noon) began within an hour after take off, so don't eat too much in the lounge.  There are both Japanese and Western selections; I chose the Western selection, which was a filet.  The two courses that preceded that were delicious, but the filet was amazing - tender and seasoned nicely.  Wine selections were pretty nice.  Food is unlimited on this flight so after dinner is served, one can eat as much as one can tolerate.  There were \"snacks\" of sandwiches, pasta, ramen, tempura and fruit/desserts.  There was a fantastic coffee mousse dessert that I absolutely loved and asked for a second helping.  Passengers are able to order up until about an hour before landing so one can get a lot of eating in those 8-11 hours.  It was 11 hours to Tokyo and 8 hours returning to LAX.\n\nThe service was impeccable! They were very gracious and helpful.  They never made you feel that you were inconveniencing them or ordering too much food or alcohol.  They made up our \"bed\" when we wanted to sleep and removed them as we prepared to land.  Once everyone had a chance to eat and relax, they dimmed the cabin lights and made sleeping very easy with hushed voices and quiet service.  I can't say enough about the quality of service from all the attendants.  They try to fulfill your requests and provide items not on the menu or in the amenity bag.  I had a sore throat and asked for a hard candy; the attendant returned with a whole cup of various flavored hard candy and let me know I could get as much as I wanted.\n\nI have no reservations about recommending this outstanding airline.",

They made sure our check-in was as easy as could be.\n\nWe are a tall family, but legroom even in economy was fine. The seats were comfortable and the food delicious.  They had very nice meals for the children and a special meal for a vegetarian in our group.\n\n Both flights were right on time, and the entertainment offered was great.\n\nEVERYTHING is great, but the star of the airline is the staff.  I have never received such pleasant and efficient service while flying. (Even when I have upgraded my seats.)  I am not sure how the flight attendants remain so cheerful on such a long flight.  They even cleaned the bathrooms during the trip.  \n\nI will certainly put this airline at the top of my list, and I will definitely book JAL when I am going anywhere they fly.",

        "review_text": "I am pleased to say I had a relatively pleasant flight journey from London to Narita un like most other airlines I had used in the past. What pleased me most with this JAL flight was the fact that there were enough leg room and seat space for someone like me , being over 170cm, who would often be troubled with lack of such space thanks to some fellow passengers in front of me who would decide to recline their seat to a great extent without due care. Hence I always get nervous for the first quarter of the flight journey in to find out if the passenger in front of me is going to be a mindless moron who would recline the seat straightaway once the seat belt sign is switched off. In this flight, there was no exception to this. However despite the reclined seat in front of me I was not troubled by the lack of space in this flight possibly due to the good seat design devised by JAL. I still had enough space in front of me and leg room to move about during the whole journey. Another good thing was I could get some sleep and wake up to the time of destination without much interference from the sun glare or some curious passengers itching to opening up window blinds to peak outside every so often ( towards the end of the journey in to Japan). It's a good idea that once you had your main meal, all the lights were out driving the passengers to believe that it's time to take some nap. Maybe I was fortunate enough to be surrounded by passengers with good common sense and decent social  etiquette in this flight alone. I managed to have some sleep during a long flight to Narita. There was a good selection of in-flight entertainment programmes and the seat was comfortable enough. The only issue I had  was to do with the touch screen of the entertainment system. It's a great idea to have a touch screen panel embedded to the seat, but I still prefer the one with remote controller. With the touch panel, depending on what kind of passenger you get behind your seat, if the person happens to be a mindless 'baboon' type who keeps *bashing* the touch screen ( not tapping) with fingers, fists or whatever every time he/she wants to change the channel, that would create a nightmare-ish situation for the poor passenger who is occupying the seat in front of them and it happened to me in this flight. I felt my seat was tapped each time this guy behind me kept changing the channel. Luckily it was just for awhile and most of the passengers were asleep after some hours later.  I do appreciate JAL is trying to keep up with the modern technology and trends, however in my view having the latest gadget does not mean it's the best for the passengers. Anyway I would fly with JAL again possibly in less busy season.",

I fly often and just can't deal with center seats so now looking at booking a new ticket on another airline so I do not have to sit middle seat...HORRIBLE PERFORMANCE JAL...no wonder you have profitability problems...",

Being a tall person, even the leg space in the economy seat was spacious enough to accommodate me. I checked in my wheelchair at the boarding gate and transferred to a cabin chair. It was waiting for me the moment I got out from the aircraft.\n\nIn the 7 hour flight, I had to go to the toilet at least once. I informed a cabin of this and he said to call them when I needed to go. Two cabin crew attended to me, one to push the cabin chair and the other to make sure we didn't roll over another passenger's foot in the semi-darkness and narrow aisle.\n\nThe toilet at the tail end of the aircraft was rather small but I just needed some privacy to perform intermittent catheterisation without having to sit on the toilet bowl. The space outside the toilet leading to the passenger cabin could be locked while the cabin crew pulled the curtains at the other end. This created a rather spacious area or me to empty my bladder.\n\nThe overall experience for flying with this airline as a wheelchair user was positive. The service on the return flight was similarly helpful and courteous.",

The first meal we had a choice but neither was edible. The second meal there was no choice, it was some supposedly special noodles with sauce. This had no taste at all. Fortunately I was exhausted and slept a lot. My one plus to this return trip was how the stewardesses took care of a family with a crying baby. I have done that before and it is very stressful. They were kind and helpful to the parents.",

Get to the point, issue was reclining seat. Seat does not recline at all. Instead seat roll down toward forward. Despite of you get more leg room than Economy Class, when seat roll down forward, you loose leg room tremendously. I did not like that. When seat roll down forward, you don't recline your back, your entire body roll down forward, just like seat. It was very uncomfortable. Premium Economy seat cost me near US$2,400. Believe in me, if your budget is around US$2,000, and need more comfort on your seat and around you, take Singapore Air \"Premium Economy\". Their seats actually recline comfortably. You also get choose meal from 3 selections when you purchase a ticket. Their entertainment program is far better than JAL. So, for near 12 hours flight, go for Singapore Air. You won't regret it.",

All seats offer good privacy and, most important, aisle access without the need to climb over someone's legs. Furthermore this allows staff to serve you directly, i.e. if you have an aisle seat they do not need to lean over you. This makes the whole service a very smooth and pleasant experience. Talking of service: Very friendly and swift, amongst the better ones you experience when travelling in C.\nThe seats offer a full flatbed, and an aircushion is provided for additional comfort. I always have had very good sleep in these seats. Lavatories are up to Japanese standards, which is pretty unique in air travel. \nWestern food options are a bit of a mixed bag, but still good. The wash bags look very impressive (Tumi), but the contents are spartanic, e.g. no moisturizer and socks. But a sweater is on offer, if you want to get out of your shirt. Large movie screens, I think it was the largest in C when launched. \nI noticed there are more crew announcements than on other airlines, which can be a bit annoying, as the entertainment system stops. Nevertheless, when given a choice, I prefer JAL over other carriers on most occasions. And the JAL lounges are very impressive, too.",

Their in-flight staff is the most courteous we have experienced - they know when to check in and when to leave you alone.  Their bathrooms are larger than most airlines.  Their legroom tends to be larger.  Their seats are quite comfortable (only caveat here is that lumbar support isn't great). They have more inflight meal selections than any other airline we have experienced but to take full advantage of that definitely call a few days before your flight.   Their inflight entertainment system is the best we've seen with a wide selection of movies and shows which you can watch on demand.",

I Certainly did not lack for food! Oh, and the beer was free!  That helped me sleep. The 787 was comfortable, with a USB plug, large screen TV in the seat back, and they even provided slippers and neck pillows (the \"U\" kind for your comfort.

I get the sense that some of the flight attendants don't have a great grasp of english so I wasn't sure if they really understood what I said but it was never an issue. The first part of my flight from yvr to nrt was on business class. The plane did not have 1st class which I think is nicer because there were more business seat options. This flight used shell flat neo which is not completely flat but at an angle. This leg was a longer flight (about 10 hours) so we had 1 additional meal as compared ot leg #2. I had thought the seat would not be as good as leg #2 but actually this seat was very comfortable. I give it a 8 out of 10 minus 1 for not fully flat and minus 1 because it never seemed to give me an ideal length for my legs and I'm not that tall (5'8\"). Leg #2 was sky suites II which gave you a lot more storage areas but felt smaller even though it really wasn't. Overall, great food choices and snacks and the anytime food selection is a great idea. Movie options I thought was just ok. The fact that it was the same options on my return flight was a bummer as I had already watched everything I wanted to see. Most movies were not really recent. I think my biggest negative would have to be the  lounge. In vancouver you use a shared lounge with other airlines (premium plaza lounge). It got very crowded. I think some of the folks in that lounge hadn't eaten in days because they were rushing the lines and ate 4 plates of stuff before I finished having my 1 cup of tea. So trying to get food was a battle. I was disappointed in the sakura lounge however as that is their main lounge. There is the main sakura lounge and smaller sakura lounge. I used both and had issues with both. In both cases they made announcements about the lounge being at capacity and it felt like it. However, in the main lounge there was plenty of room but they separated their dining area to an area where you need to walk up. So you had to eat in that dining area which was very small. If the food was in the main lounge area there wouldn't be such a sea of humanity clustered together. I opted not to have any kind of food in either lounge because of the crowds and because the food didn't look very good. The lounge at singapore was also a shared lounge and the food there was also mediocre. JAL's biggest negative for me was their website. Its not very well done and the check in process is not well thought out. They ask for a lot of information including your passport info which I had already previously provided. When you are on the road more than likely you are on slow hotel wifi. Their check in page asked for too much and not user friendly. Additionally, they expect you to check in each segment separately. They also don't provide you with electronic boarding pass. Thats bad if you are connecting to their flight. If you were connecting without a boarding pass you likely will have to go to the main departure terminal and redo security because inside a terminal you're not likely to find someone who can print the boarding pass for you. This will vary from airport to airport.",
