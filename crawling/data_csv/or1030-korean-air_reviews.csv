Korea air price gouging,Qingdao,Vancouver,International,"Bought my round trip ticket between china and Canada only 3 weeks ahead of time. Price was going up. Two days after my purchase the price dropped $150. Definitely using phone cache and price gouging.

A good economy product,Seattle,Bangkok,International,"We fly basic economy by Korean Airline to Thailand (with a transit stop at Seoul [ICN airport]). With the basic economy, we are unable to select seat during the booking stage or before check-in, however, we have had no trouble to select a preferred seat (isle) during the check-in stage. We have also got one checked backage (though we did not choose to use the luggage allowance.) and a carry on with one cabin baggage + 1 personal item. The 1st flight (from North America to ICN) is pretty empty and pleasant. The 2nd flight segment (from ICN to Bangkok) is pretty full.

WORST AIRLINE EVER,Sydney,Busan,International,"If I could give this airline 0 or even -1 out of 5 I would.
Similar to the reviews above they have no idea on how to handle cancelled or delayed flights due to bad weather; I am aware that this was the heaviest snowfall since records begun but the way the airline and airport staff reacted to this was as if no one had ever seen snow or managed cancelled/delayed flights before.

We were stuck on the tarmac for 2 hours +, with announcements only every 30 minutes to say 'we have been advised to wait here for a few more minutes'. We got a text on arrival to say our flight from Seoul to Busan had been cancelled, with no further information on any alternative options.

When we finally disembarked and got to the service counter, a huge line awaited us. The lady at the desk was neither helpful or sympathetic, simply told us to go through immigration, collect our luggage and take a bus. My initial impression was that they had organised a bus for us, but NO. We got to the bus ticket counter who told us there was only 1 ticket left for the night (travelling as a duo). We then had to make our own way to Busan by train. Korean air have so far refused to compensate the taxi ride to Seoul train station or the train to Busan, simply offering a refund of 1/5th of the price of the ticket from Seoul to Busan by plane.

WORST FLIGHT EXPERIENCE SO FAR!,Manila,New York City,International,"I've been flying Korean Air for years since I liked how kind and pleasant the flight crew and I also liked their food. HOWEVER! This was the most chaotic, stressful and frustrating flight ever! Hundreds of people were stranded at the airport due to weather condition. SEEMS LIKE IT'S THE FIRST TIME THAT SNOWED IN SOUTH KOREA AND NO ONE KNOWS WHAT TO DO IN THIS KIND OF SITUATION?! I missed my connecting flight to NY due to delayed flight from Manila, my connecting flight was supposed to be 8:30pm and I get off the plane at the same time. The crew in Manila told me that if I missed my flight, the crew in Korea will help me but what happened? I was standing and waiting in line for more than an hour to rebook my flight but when the people started piling up they closed the customer service and  told everyone to go inside the airport and someone will assist for rebooking a ticket. But when I get inside the Transfer desk were closed, the Korean Air Lounge were closed , the whole floor were closed and no one to speak to. They are pointing fingers to whom to talk to and been telling people that they don't know nothing! Eveyone was on the the floor, people literally slept on the floor, and worst, even elderly on the wheelchair have to wait and stayed in line while waiting until the next morning. I stayed at the airport for almost 20hours with NO COMPENSATION, NO NOTHING!! I had to chat a live agent and rebook my own flight. Everyone was waiting for nothing! WHAT A SHAME KOREAN AIR! And when I finally arrived in NY, I waited for almost 2hrs only to find out that they lost one of my luggage and told me that it's not on their list. I literally had no energy to argue since I've been travelling for almost 40hrs and has not enough sleep. They just told me that they will file a report but no assurance. I chatted a live agent and told me that IT IS NOT GUANTEED that they could find my luggage, not even mentioning a compensation to ease my frustration.

South Korean airlines incompetence and race-based preference.,San Francisco,Manila,International,"I'm writing this review after the cancellation that Korean Air refused to give the passengers on KE623 a reason for. We had watched many domestic passengers able to fly but the flights to Manila and Hong Kong were canceled. A passenger on the Hong Kong flight was told by the attendance that it was mismanagement that caused it. We were stuck taxing for 4 hours without any explanation. When we arrived in the airport they kept changing our gate and saying that we were going to leave and had us run across the airport many of the people on the flight were elderly or with elders. They refuse to provide any explanation they told all passengers that they had to go to the the travel desk to get their arrangements changed. However once you arrived the desk was closed and the wait for that line was 8 to 12 hours. When we brought up the fact that it should be on their side to rebook an entire flight. They were hostile and refused to make any accommodations although this was on their side. At one point one of the agents decided to square up or a cost one of the American passengers. If it wasn't for the group of Filipinos Americans and other nationalities standing there behind this man we do strongly believe he would have started a fight The American had not done anything to deserve this he was not being threatening he was reminding the agent of the duties the airlines had for their clients. When we decided to take pictures and record he got very aggressive and started taking pictures of passengers. We had to go to another agent to let them know what was happening and nothing was done he was just moved to another area. When we brought up the fact that we have no place to sleep we cannot leave the airport we are entitled to some kind of compensation such as food vouchers and hotel those simple requests that are met by most if not all airports were on deaf ears. The agent was saying that he doesn't speak English but was interpreting and speaking very well it was just an excuse to try to push us away. If this is the welcome that a Korean airlines has for foreigners within Korea I think that that was the last time I will be going to Korea. It is embarrassing for The nation of Korea to welcome your foreign guests with such hostility and such a lack of courtesy, consideration, and adherence to their own policies. I would strongly recommend anyone to travel with any airlines other than Korean Air. Smaller regional airlines have done far more than Korean Air attempted to do. It was apparent that no one wanted to make a decision and the airlines refuse to have anybody of value working during the busy time. We had to wait until the lead got on the clock for anything to happen. All the agents kept saying they couldn't do anything until the lead came on and finally they started to rebook people. However the rebooking seemed to be preferential and was not consistent and still required each individual passenger to make the change rather than the airlines accommodating due to their poor management. I would have imagined that an international airport would have at least employed some translators to avoid this type of mess however I don't think that would have made a difference given the attendance actually were really good with English. Rather than try to claim accountability they found every which way to avoid responsibility for their mistake. Even as the weather cleared up they did not have any planes ready for the Philippines or Hong Kong however the korean-based flights were all continuing. I am not sure if this was a result of Korean airs fiasco in the Philippines on November 18 when they ran one of the airplanes off the Manila runway. Truth be told if they had made some form of accommodation for the passengers they had stranded I would not have been writing this review. They gave all of the food vouchers minutes before the flight took off as an attempt to prevent anyone from purchasing any food and the vouchers would be useless. They did not give any hotel vouchers for the hotels in the airport. Which is what they have on their own agreement. They were trying to play on the ignorance of their passengers rather than accept the responsibility and claim culpability in the mistake that they had created themselves. I know that Korea is not new to snow and this was something I'm having a hard time placing as anything other than racially based. Their treatment towards the Filipinos was abhorrent and downright disgusting. I really had higher expectations for this airline however I will never be traveling with them and really question if I would want to go to South Korea ever again. For the passengers that were protecting the Korean Air name I feel some consideration should have been given especially since we had gone to other agents to tell them that their ticket agent there was threatening passengers.",November 2024,"November 29, 2024",1.0,,,,,,,,
"Impossibly terrible management during crisis. Shame, because good on boardm service!",Seoul,Toronto,International,"Have flown Korean Air before and had great experiences, but this flight experience was appalling.
The flight was delayed due to weather, fine. This is unavoidable and an important safety feature (37 hours is a little too long though!). HOWEVER, their handling of the emergency was disastrous and dangerous.

We sit on the tarmac for 7 hours, get off the plane with NO direction, eventually find the transfer desk.
Get given a ticket with a scribbled on number (am I at a deli?) and told to wait. They get through 60 people in about 13 hours (I was number #263) and then they close the desk outright for 6 hours. I sleep on the floor.
Note; NO HOTEL, WATER, FOOD, OR COMPENSATION WAS OFFERED.

I wake up and stand at the desk again. After waiting two hours and passengers literally fighting (punches thrown, shirts pulled) and screaming at each other for service, I eventually get a reprinted ticket. Good on-board service, good product. But management during this emergency was tragic. Like they were the first ever flight cancellation in history and no-one knew what to do.

Refund needed !,San Francisco,Chiang Mai,International,"I am writing to formally express my disappointment and frustration with the service I received during a recent trip, and to request a refund for a cancelled flight.

My flight with Korean Air was canceled due to weather conditions, and while I understand that safety must take precedence, the handling of the situation was unacceptable. Despite the flight being delayed by 45 minutes, there was no communication about the cancellation of my connecting flight, even though your flight attendants were aware of the itinerary. Additionally, Korean Air had advance knowledge of the severe snowstorm—one of the largest in years—but failed to plan or inform passengers adequately.

The lack of updates while we circled the runway for over three hours, combined with the unhelpful and often rude treatment at ticketing counters, only worsened the situation. Many passengers, including myself, were left to find alternative travel arrangements on our own. I had to purchase a 24-hour ticket to Malaysia at my own expense, costing over $1,000 USD, to reach my final destination in Chiang Mai, Thailand.

I was further frustrated by Korean Air’s refusal to offer a refund for the cancelled flight, despite Department of Transportation guidelines that require airlines to provide refunds in such circumstances. This lack of accountability and assistance during a crisis left me feeling abandoned and undervalued as a customer.

I am not seeking compensation for the missed hotel stays or excursions; I simply ask for a refund of the ticket cost for the cancelled flight. I believe this is a fair request given the circumstances and aligns with the basic standards of customer service and regulatory compliance.",November 2024,"November 28, 2024",1.0,,,,,,,,

Disappointing Experience with Korean Air at San Francisco Airport and Incheon,San Francisco,Seoul,International,"I recently had a highly unsatisfactory experience with Korean Air during my travel from San Francisco to Bangkok, via Seoul.

I was forced to cancel my entire ticket and purchase a new one-way ticket to Bangkok, costing me an additional $1,200.

The customer service was far from empathetic. I was not informed at booking that not completing the last leg of my journey would necessitate such a drastic measure and financial penalty. This lack of communication and the inflexible policies imposed a significant financial strain and inconvenience.

An excellent travel experience,Seoul,Brisbane,International,"For our trip from Seoul (South Korea)  to Brisbane (Australia), we chose Korean Air, due to its partnership with Etihad Airways where we have premium status.  It was our first time flying with Korean Air, and it was an excellent experience.  We flew Business Class, in a very new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner. 

The online  booking process on the airline’s website was straightforward, and the online check-in process via the Korean Air app was simple and easy.  Seoul Incheon Airport is a vast complex, and one of the largest and busiest airports in the world.  Korean Air leaves from the newer of the two terminals, Terminal 2.   The terminal was very crowded, with long check-in lines for all flights, including KE407 to Brisbane.  Fortunately Korean Air  has a  large dedicated check-in zone specifically for business class passengers for all their flights; there were no queues, and the check-in process was efficient, professional and speedy.  

As we were travelling business we had access  one of the Korean Air lounges in Terminal 2.  It was extremely busy, and whilst the food and drink offerings were adequate, we did not rate it as highly as other airline lounges we have used.  

Our flight to Brisbane was extremely comfortable.  The Business Class cabin has a 1-2-1 layout.  Whilst individual seats were slightly narrower than the business offering on Etihad Airways  and  ANA All Nippon Airlines, it was still spacious and extremely comfortable.  The screen was a decent size, and the entertainment offerings seemed adequate (I chose to rest).  The flat bed was easy to operate, with ample bedding and pillows for a comfortable rest.  The amenity kit was excellent.  

Service was excellent.  Crew were attentive, professional, and charming.  The selection of food on the dinner service was commendable, with considerable choice and options for different palates.  It was served graciously, and when we wanted to eat. 

The loading of the flight was a bit chaotic, mainly because of people not wanting to wait their turn to board.  The flight departed on time, and arrived into Brisbane on time. 

If the occasion arose, we could certainly choose Korean Air again.",April 2024,"November 9, 2024",5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0
A FANTASTIC EXPERIENCE,Las Vegas,Seoul,International,"Korean Air has spoiled  us. Even in economy class, the seating offered spacious leg room and ample carry on luggage storage. Our ultimate destination was Hong Kong, with a 2 hour lay over in Korea. On both legs of the flights the service was impeccable. Their stewardesses were so professional. They were beautifully uniformed, with perfectly coiffed hair and delicate make up. It was like the old days of the PanAm stewardesses and very unlike the American stewardesses of today, who often look thrown together  , with messy hair, blah uniforms and grumpy faces. The Korean stewardesses  made you feel like you were their welcomed guests. The airline food was 5 star, believe it or not. It was hot, tasty and plentiful!! The airplanes themselves were  clean and refreshing, with the staff always tidying up. In the rear of the plane they offered a snack bar that you could self serve at anytime during the flight. At your seat, to help during your over night flight,  they gave you a toothbrush, toothpaste and slippers. Even on the short 3 hour flight from Korea to Hong Kong, we were give a wonderful warm lunch and the bathroom supplied wrapped toothbrushes, toothpaste and facial spritzes. The airport itself in Korea was cleaner that you could imagine. It probably would have been safe enought to eat off of the floor! LOL. US airlines really need to take notice and step it up. We travel the world frequently, usually using US based airlines. On them, flights are constatly delayed or canceled. We are never made to feel like welcomed guests who have spent their hard earned money to enjoy a vacation which includes air travel. Korean Air ran like clock work on every level of service.

Stupid always wins! Try and debate your travel paperwork with a Korean employer in English! Good luck.,Seoul,Manila,Southeast Asia,"The worst airline experience I have ever had. Starting with the confused checkin process where they ask you for your boarding pass and can’t understand why you have it electronically. As if we should have guessed that on that specific day the staff wanted only paper. Wtf! 
Then we get refused check in for my father in law because he had special wheelchair service, so instead of processing that we get to wait in another line for that check in. Wtf!!?? Then I’m called up at the gate and questioned about my residency card for the Philippines. The lady doesn’t speak any English or at best a two year old’s comprehension level. Indeed that interaction was a joke as she decided I needed a return ticket and my perfectly valid residency card is not enough. It was weird and frustrating to think that some idiot they hired and put into a role who doesn’t speak any language other than Korean is specifically tasked with the job dealing with non Koreans about the validity of their residencies and passports which are all in English. Wtf!!! 
It took some other lady who could hardly be bothered with this exercise to basically dismiss this person and say I’m ok to fly…she still wouldn’t accept it until three other people told her. It was surreal experience. As a result:
-I will never go to Korea again
-I will never fly on Korean Airlines again
- I will never book anything to do with Korean airlines or any of their services

HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE WITH KOREA AIR - Greedy airline that doesn’t take ownership of their mistakes,Tokyo,Los Angeles,International,"My flight was delayed over 30 minutes and it caused me to miss my other flight back to the states which cost me over $1000. I consulted the management and they said there was nothing they could do. I understand that the time in between my flights was shorter however if I landed on time it would’ve been at the airport at 3:35pm and my next flight was at 5:10pm. I made it to the security line at 5:10pm and if I had an extra 35 mins I definitely would’ve made it. I explained that I was right at the airport about to enter at 5:10pm and I missed my flight due to the delay. They continued to move up the chain with communication after I refused to take “sorry there’s nothing we can do” as an answer and eventually they gave me a free night at a hotel which is about $70. The same day flight for my other airline (Japan Airlines) would cost me $3000 usd. Now I have to spend $600 more on a flight and spend even more money due to the fact there was a delay with Korea airline. They said that because of air traffic control that’s the reason why there was a delay. Shouldn’t airlines take ownership of that since they did not get me to my destination on time? Totally unfair, I would’ve made my other flight on time if there was no delay.

unfair seat selection,New York City,Seoul,International,"if you didn't buy your ticket through the Korean airlines website, you cannot get the seat you want. But they don't tell you that. It is just ridiculous. This airline operates for a small market (people going from/to Korea mainly) so they just do whatever they want to do with the prices and seat selection options.

Korean Airlines- Worst Airline,New York City,Hong Kong,International,"Literally the worst experience I have ever had on an international flight. I have been flying to Asia for business for 30 years- I have flown pretty much any airline you can imagine. Post pandemic most of the US Airlines stopped flying to Asia and instead rely on their co-chairs. While flying business class to Asia is markedly better than economy, as a business traveler certain things are really important. Space & Comfort being the most important. I started my 10 day Asia/3 Country journey at JFK where I was booked on a Delta flight operated by Korean Air. What a disappointment. The cabin was fine if you were on a 5-6 hour flight, it was not fine for a 15 hour flight to ICN and then catching a connection to HKG. These days in international business class all airlines have lay down flat beds and most have little cabins with a nice amount of storage and space, even if seats are right next to each other, the new designs offer an incredible amount of privacy, comfort and space.  Not Korea Air. The seats were horribly uncomfortable. The separation from the seat next to you is a tiny little slide out separation screen that is barely there.  Unless you have a window seat with cabinets, there is zero storage around your seat. For 15 hours you usually have stuff with you- headphones water bottles an extra sweatshirt to deal with the ups and downs of cabin temperature phone phone charger. Well all of that was just rolling around either on top of me or in the little side space next to the console. I can’t count how many times my phone feel in between my seat and the console or how many times things dropped and rolled under my seat or the gentleman next to me. The seat was not soft and cushy and was quite uncomfortable. The privacy was zero. And these are not inexpensive seats. They are highly priced. Korean Air has been a huge disappointment. Now I am sitting on my connection to HKG that was delayed 20 minutes. We board and every 15 minutes the pilot tells us ‘ 15 more minutes’  it’s a late night flight and at this rate we won’t land in HK before midnight. I was told the flight was delayed waiting for connecting passengers. I’m all for being flexible but subjecting an entire flight full of travelers to an hours long delay because Korean Air cannot get their connecting passengers to the flight on time seems to me to be a problem they need to deal with. I’m fine waiting 10-15 minutes. But a full hour!
So a giant ZERO for Korea Air. If you are looking for a high end experience, look elsewhere.",September 2024,"September 18, 2024",1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0

The IFE a bit old and not too responsive, had to use the remote rather than touch screen. Bibimbap for lunch was great. The meal served at JFK was larger size than that from ICN.

They stopped serving ramen noodles, and one of them refused to provide hot water to DIY noodles. The FA on my section was polite and personable, she made the experience enjoyable, cannot recall her name. On the second leg of flight, another FA thought the kids across from the aisle were related to me, but I had to decline her offer!

Ignored medical issue,Seoul,Seattle,International,"I was pregnant when I flew and began having sharp, terrible pain in my side. I held it as much as I could because I do not enjoy bringing attention to myself. 

The flight attendants came to check on me and found a doctor on the flight. I don’t think they realized I understood Korean. The doctor said that I was just young and nervous for my baby while flying and that I was just reacting because of that. 

Well I went to the doctor and actually turned out to be a kidney issue and NOT all in my head like they were discussing. I was so upset at how I was treated and how it was handled.",October 2023,"September 7, 2024",1.0,,,,,,,,
Time to upgrade the cabin,Seoul,Rome,International,"I flew on Korean Air's Boeing 777-300ER aircraft from ICN to FCO and back. The business class has a 2-3-2 layout which is rather outdated. I sat on 7F and 7D, bulkhead aisle seats. The lie-flat seat is reasonably comfortable, but the lack of storage space is a problem. Also, there was little privacy as the partition between the seats was rather small. Being on a bulkhead seat, I could not watch the (rather small) TV monitor during takeoff and landing. The flight attendants were, as always, very efficient and friendly. The in-flight meals were pretty good with a decent collection of wines.

"One of the best experiences I’ve had, would go again.",Seoul,Vancouver,International,"One of the best experienced I have had. The staff were kind and offered Korean and English announcements (or automated messages depending on where you are coming from, e.g. Guangzhou Baiyun, China to Vancouver BC Canada via Seoul Incheon South Korea also had Chinese Simplified). This was a round trip from Vancouver BC Canada to Wuhan China via Seoul South Korea (took the high speed rail to Guangzhou after Wuhan visit). 

Metal cutlery, free earbuds, good food and others for economy which is very good. Seat isn't the best for long flights like pacific ocean crossings, but it works. Flight from Vancouver to Seoul was delayed by 1 hour due to heavy turbulence on the way. Pilots did a good job Seoul to Wuhan, despite strong winds they landed softly, which was common for the other landings (soft part, not strong winds), but cabin noise can still be an issue, still relatively quiet. However, from Seoul to Wuhan my earbud case fell pretty deep into the seat pocket in front of me, which annoyed me and took a long time to retrieve (it was an A330, very old so understandable I guess)

We then had to walk the entire length of the airport, stopping multiple times to ask people to please allow us to borrow a wheelchair which we were denied every time! Then when getting to our gate our flight was delayed to the next day unexpectedly (which happens, sure.) but when we asked for a wheelchair for her to walk back across the airport to leave she was STILL denied!! The rudeness and lack of care by the Korean air people have completely turned me off to using them again and frankly visiting Incheon again! It was disheartening and very upsetting!

As a matter of fact they were quite upset if you raised your window, why, is it to keep the passenger from noticing that thru out the flight we received two mediocre meals and drink service, plus one snack with orange juice.  The waitresses (not flight attendants) hid mainly behind the curtains and the only time we actually saw them is running to the bathroom to make sure that the toilet paper end is a triangle.

Overall Satisfaction!,Beijing,Kathmandu,Asia,"This is the first time I flew with Korean Air. In my experience, it isn't too bad with good legroom in economy class and departed on time. However, my itinerary has been changed a few times at the time of booking, and my seat assignment. My flight to Nepal has 13 hours of layovers in Seoul, which makes me book a hotel for the night. 

Check-in at the airport in Beijing goes smoothly but they are strict when it comes to overweight luggage. Although I'm a light traveler with a carry-on they weigh my bag which is right below the maximum of 10 kgs. I love their onboard duty-free, you should try their lip gloss - a pretty good Korean product.

Meals on board are the same as other airlines nothing special, the air hostesses were friendly. Onboard entertainment was more Korean movies.

A few weeks before departing Sydney i received an email from the airline telling me that they had changed our seats and now my whole family was sitting separately  and away from each other 6-7 rows apart.
I had called customer service and was on the phone to them for over 2 hours telling them that this was not happening and they would need to resolve the seating arrangment asap before i take this further, after 2 hours of going back and forth, they finally agreed to change our seats back together as we initially booked in the beginning.

Service was terrible on the aeroplane going to incheon and back.

Flight attentants were being racist and clearly choosing to help their people (asian looking) rather than us white people.

I had my infant sitting on my lap and i pressed the bell to ask them to remove the trays of food from the tray table as i needed to get up as my infant was becoming unsettled and didnt want him making a mess... 

I WAITED for 15 mins when the Korean person infront me pressed the bell and 2 flight attentants came straight to him to assist him with whatever he needed. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING.

My flights were rescheduled 4/5 times. Each time, I had to log into the website and reselect my seat. When the flight was eventually cancelled, I was told that I could have a refund, or they would book me in for a night in Incheon. This meant that it took me three days to get home as my journey was extended by the unnecessary stay in Korea.

When you recline, there is a two inch gap separating your seat pad from the backrest, so your lower back is completely unsupported and pain will ensue. I have never felt more pain on a long haul flight than with Korean Air. 

We had two drink services the entire flight. When I asked for water, an tired air stewardess sitting on a jump seat (for a rest, there was no turbulence or seat belt signs at this point) told me that 'I can get my own water', and pointed to the bottle in the galley. 

I did not eat the first meal as they had run out of chicken. 8 hours into the flight, I said that I hadn't eaten and could I have a snack (as the next meal service was in 4 hours). Despite tens of people being given ramen, I was told this wasn't an option and they could bring me a cereal bar. The air steward brought me what appeared to be an aubergine sandwich, some digestives and some cereal bars in lieu of an actual meal. 

Worst of all. I realised a few hours in that my seatbelt was broken. If I leant, the seatbelt loosened with me. After standing and sitting a comical number of times to have the stewardess check my belt, she tied it in a knot. Later, she returned, untied the knot and said 'I made a mistake, it's okay, if we crash, just hold it'. When Korean prides itself on safety, a broken seatbelt should be treated with appropriate severity. 

Avoid Korean Air like the plague. Abysmal service outbound and inbound.",April 2024,"April 24, 2024",1.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0
Terrible Check in Bag Employee,New York City,Manila,International,"I love Korean Air until last Oct. 2023 when i approached the check in bag lady. I gave her my documents a printed airline ticket.  She said she don’t need it.  She asked me where i am going to, i said to Manila. She checked my US passport and asked me “where is my visa”.  I said what visa?  She said you need a visa to enter Philippines.  “What are talking about? I said I don’t need visa, i am a US citizen and have even dual citizenship” .  
Then she asked me again the first document i gave her.   So ridiculous.  I cannot forget this stupidity.  She is not even an immigration officer to ask me o interrogate me.  I think she is power tripping, and thought i was an idiot.  My American husband even apologized to her idiocy, because i started raising my voice from annoyance.  It is my worst experience in the airport.  I am a frequent traveler, from US, EU to Asia.  Never i have a problem like this before.",October 2023,"April 21, 2024",3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,,1.0,5.0
Meh...not feeling much Prestige with Korean Air,Los Angeles,Seoul,International,"Overall, not great. 
Pros: Kind, helpful flight attendants.  

Cons: Price, Plane interior, food, ""Prestige"" lounges (especially LAX!)

The LAX lounge was disgusting!  Didn't open until 9 a.m.??? Why? Because we only arrive on their schedule?  The food was stale and bland.  Everything that was supposed to be hot was cold; and everything that was supposed to be cold was warm.  Stale bread and rubber veggies.  Place was dark, depressing--and unfriendly!

Just in case it was me being difficult (I mean, I spend $6500 for this class!), I checked out the Quantas lounge across the hall, and the One World (British Airways, American Airlines, etc.) lounge downstairs.  They were both much, much better!  Clean, bright, plenty of real food, and an open bar (I don't drink, but, c'mon!).  

The food on the plane was fine, but not great.  The breakfast on the return flight looked so bad I immediately gave it back.  Grey hard ""scrambled"" eggs, and what was listed as ""bacon"" in the menu appeared to be lukewarm prosciutto...yechh!

""Prestige"" class seats are out-dated and very uncomfortable, given the flight's duration (14 hours there, 11 back).  Incredibly, the seat armrests are different heights!  One of your arms is literally 3 inches lower/higher than the other!  WHAT???

I would never recommend this airline, or this class, to anyone. Very disappointed KA!

First time on Korean Air. SFO-->MNL.,San Francisco,Manila,International,"I'm not going to Nit-pick, as my first time on Korean Air, I thought they did a awesome job. Boarding was fine, cabin crew was attentive and spoke enough English that communication wasn't a problem. Plane (777-300er) was clean, and I like their cabin layout (3-3-3), minimalizing middle seats (United, American and Delta take note!). I love the nice slippers that are supplied. Food was good enough that I don't really have any complaints.  Incheon was a very nice airport, it looked like a shopping mall.

Rigid Penalty Policy Even in Family Emergency,Tokyo,Seoul,North Asia,"This is a review on the customer service I received for a flight that I had to cancel due to a family emergency. 

Before I go into detail the summary of my experience: customer service agents were unwilling to elevate my call to a supervisor even when asked. One straight out saying her supervisor refused to speak to me, Korean Air’s penalty policy is rigid even in times of family emergency and their response time to email is ridiculous. It took a month for them to get back to me and that was after I sent two follow up emails. 

Details:
My children and I were called back from our trip early as my dog had gone into kidney failure and my children wanted to see him before he passed. 

I called first and then emailed to try and get a refund. I received a partial refund. They charged me a penalty as the death of a dog is not considered an emergency, as a side note from the policy I was sent the death of my husband’s grandmother would not have counted for me either. 

If it was a small penalty I would have had no issue but it was $67 per ticket for our flight to Incheon and $150 per ticket for our flight into Los Angeles.

The initial person I spoke with told me I could keep it as a credit but due to my daughter heading to medical school I cannot have that much money tied up in airline credit as I had to put out additional money to get a flight back to the states from Japan. 

In summary I cannot comment on their flights but their customer service when things go wrong is disappointing.",March 2024,"April 10, 2024",2.0,,,,2.0,,,,
Good value and service,Seoul,London,International,"This was my returning flight from Incheon Korea back to London UK. Compared to my outbound flight, this was a much less pleasant experience. The flight was full of passengers (?99% full, with only several vacant seats towards the rear). Passengers were much less considerate in this flight. Snacks and blankets were dropped all over the floor in the front part of the economy section. A lad sittiing in my row, likely in his early 20s, had 3 cans of beer, 1 cup noodles in addition to the 2 meals and snacks provided in this 13.5 hours flight. For the rest of the time when he was not eating and drinking, he gave stinky farts and sneezed multiple times without covering his nose. A middle-age guy was arrested when the plane landed in Heathrow, for smoking in the toilet on flight. 

Despite all these inconsiderate passengers, the flight crew was doing a wonderful job meeting requests of passengers with a pleasant attitude. They also tidied up the toilets mid-flight, making a long haul flight less of an ordeal, which I really appreciate. In-flight entertainment was updated (as of 31 March 2024). I was able to watch an enjoyable Korean drama not available on Netflix, and that killed at least 5 hours of my flight. Meals were nice, and I especially enjoyed the sandwiches provided as snack mid-flight. 

The flight was delayed for an hour at Incheon Airport due to connection issues. When I first booked the air ticket, departure time was 2 hours later but the arrival time remained the same. I guess the airline factored in the delay which might be a frequent issue. The flight route actually looked shorter, at the plane flew over Russia, rather than the Middle East as in the outbound flight. 

I booked 2.5 months ahead of time and it cost 1100 pounds for a return flight from London UK to Osaka Japan, transferring at Incheon Korea. Travelling with Japanese airlines JAL or ANA would cost another 700 pounds more and it would not be a direct flight either. You would still need a connecting flight at Haneda airport in Tokyo. Would definitely fly Korean Air again next time when I go to Korea and Japan from London. 

On another note, I met other Londoners at the departure gate to find that the flight was delayed and could not find eateries near the departure gates at Incheon Airport. Actually Dunkin Doughnuts was right opposite the gate and Paris Croissants was towards the end of the terminal. They ended up getting nice sandwiches while I had my last iced latte and red bean bun before I left Korea, and both were delicious.",March 2024,"April 1, 2024",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

But when Korean person changed his sit and sit on the same 47 H “emergency exit sit” the same flight attendant just explained him what he shall do in case of emergency.

Now we are sitting in the middle row (after we planned we'll and booked months in advance and paid extra for seats).

I bought my ticket separately, and by the time I purchased, first was all gone, so I was in the back.  Also of note is my ticket in economy cost more than the first class seat my wife got up front.
Folks, timing is everything when buying a plane ticket.  KIX airport system is all screwed up, they need to rethink their management a bit.
KAL check in was smooth, quick efficient and pleasant.  (Since I was travelling with my wife who had up front ticket, KAL let me check in with hear, so this is sort of cheating).  Economy would have given me quite a bit of grief getting through security.  Wife secured a FAST LANE, and the check in counter was nice enough to give me one too reasoning that we were travelling together, even though I was in economy.  Lesson here is if you can wing a first class ticket for one of your party, you can avoid a lot of grief.  I don't know if any rules were broken for me or not, but I really appreciated that pass.  Flight was less than an hour and a half but they fed me lunch which was surprisingly quite good.  I don't know why they feed you on such a short flight, but they do, and i appreciate the hard working flight attendants.  Going through ICN immigration and customs is a breeze.

The In-Flight Entertainment kept us busy with various movies, television shows, and music. You can see a difference in quality depending on the aircraft. Overall their systems worked seamlessly. Bring your own headphones; the earbuds found on their shorter flights are much better quality than the overhead headphones on long-haul flights.

The food served was amazing in terms of airplane food. On our flight from ICN - - > JFK I was very impressed with the Chicken Curry option. The spice and flavors tasted perfect 30,000 feet in the air. Their portions are a bit large as I was never hungry, even during a 15 1/2 hour flight.

"Great if you get prestige Suites, otherwise…..",Edinburgh,Brisbane,International,"This was my first long haul trip with Korean Air to Australia but my 15th trip there.

My flights were a codeshare with KLM: EDI-AMS (KL 737-800); 5+ hour layover; AMS-ICN (KE 777-300); 4 hour layover; ICN-BNE (KE 777-200). Return SYD-ICN (KE 747-8); 17 hour layover; ICN-AMS (KE 777-300); 4 hour layover; AMS-EDI (KL 737-800)

On the day of the outbound journey there were severe storms in the UK and also impacting Northern Europe. WE were 2.5 hours late departing but i was just glad we got away at all - the weather was really atrocious. hats off to KLM and particularly the Captain who came to speak to us at the gate to update us on what was happening. I can’t recall that happening.

The flight to AMS was a bit bumpy to say the least but impeccable service from KLM who managed to serve meals and drinks. Just before we started our descent, the captain read out all the missed connections (there were a lot) as well as gate numbers for the connections that were still possible but tight.

I was glad of my longish connection by AMS standards. passenger assistance were a wee bit slow in showing up for me, but understandable in the circumstances and they took me to the Crown 52 lounge. Only had about 90 minutes before they were back to take me for my first long haul flight.

Boarding was pretty smooth and initial impressions were good. This 777 had their new style business seating of 2 2 2 with separate aisle access for all as they had staggered the pairs at windows. There was a decent amount of space, storage and privacy, once the partition was raised after take off. Bed was lie flat and quite comfortable and I managed to get quite a good amount of sleep.

There were 5 courses for dinner and food was quite nice but a bit repetitive as I took the other flights (beef tenderloin was the European option on all 4 flights) I found it also quite healthy too with plenty of vegetables and dessert always being fresh fruit platter.

There was no order on demand as some airlines do in BC and instead of servicing each course separately, some were served together on a try with finsjed plates left to later and removed when the tray was removed. No big deal though.

The lancet was the thin things you usually get in economy on other airlines but as the cabin was quite warm to too warm at times, it didn’t matter.

We were 15 minutes late departing but arrived on time. Passenger assistance arrive promptly and whistled me off to the prestige Lounge (think it was West but not certain). had a couple of hours there before passenger assistance were back to take me to my next flight.

Boarding was quick but was disappointed when I got onboard. This was the first time I realised that not all their prestige cabins had their Prestige Suites. This was a 2 3 2 quite cramped conjugation, angle flat rather than lie flat, no storage or privacy. in fact you didn’t even have a separate armrest but had to share one. The seats were also fairly uncomfortable when reclined and I got little sleep. menu was pretty much the same as the previous flight.

We arrived a little early nd after a short wait I was collected by special assitance and whisked through immigration, collected my bags and taken straight to the taxi rank to get to the city.

Overall it was a mixed experience, with the first being great and the second just so so. More like PE a than long haul BC but I got to my destination on time and they were several thousand GBP cheaper than my preferred option of QR.

the return was a fairly drawn out journey with the overnight layover and taking 53 hours to get to my home from leaving my hotel in Sydney. It was long and tedious for sure!

The first flight on the 747 was great, back to the comfy Prestige Suites again. This was a day time flight so i decided to use the IFE. I don’t usually as I wear over ear hearing aids but I plugged my table mic i use sometimes into the slot for the headphones and the audio streaming worked really well. I enjoyed the movie I found but couldn’t find any others that I fancied, so relaxed, read and napped.

At ICN, i was met by passenger assistance and taken through Immigration and customs. No one wanted to see the QR code for the quarantine thing I had filled in on the app nor the online Customs form. maybe they already could see them when they scanned my passport. It was just my passport and the paper arrival form they looked at.

I was taken directly to the Grand Hyatt’s minibus that was sitting at arrivals. We had a wait of about 10 minutes before we were on our way. the bus displays the timetable for the shuttle to and from the hotel which was quite handy.

It was pretty cold when we landed, only 6c and i was glad I didn’t have to hang about outside waiting. At the hotel checkin only took about 10 minutes or so. they had a lot of staff ready to deal with the group from the shuttle. I wanted to leave a credit card authorisation with them so I could order room service but they would not allow that Presume as the account was booked in the airline’s name0. Dinner and breakfast was included. i didn’t need dinner though. i tried explaining that I would struggle to get to the buffet in the other building on my own and I would prefer to pay for room service in the morning. She told me i could call in the morning and pay on delivery. That did not work though - they would not accept my order.

They had a meme ber of staff escort me to my room which was nice and had a really comfortable bed. The toilet wasn’t a surprise after having been forewarned on this forum.

I had a good night’s sleep but no breakfast other than tea and a cereal bar I found in my carry on. Not the end of the world and i just went to the airport half an hour earlier than I planned to have breakfast in the lounge.

The minibus ran precisely to schedule and took us back to the departure area where I had got on the night before. Got a bit lost at this point. I knew that i had to get up to level 3 for departures but could not see any signs pointing to escalators or lifts or even a set of stairs. they all seemed to be connected with arriving passengers. Fortunately another passenger came over to ask if I needed help and walked me to where the lifts were. So far so good. However when I reached level 3 there were various check in areas and I could not see where to go to find passenger assitance. Someone from the airline eventually rescued me and started to tow me by the sleeve towards exit immigration. I tried explaining that I had booked assitance to which she said she was helping me through. then i used the magic word wheelchair and she turned around and took me to one of the heck in counters and left me there.  The lady issued my final boarding pass from AMS -EDI ( as they hadn’t been able to issue it in SYD) and told me to go 2 desks up, so i did so and she made a cal Presumambly to assitance. She told me to wait by the wall and someone would come. After 15 minutes I was still standing there leaning on the wall and made eye contact with her. She picked up the phone again and sounded a bit cross. Anyway that worked and someone turned up with a wheelchair 5 minutes later.

Going through exit immigration and security was quick and then off to the miler Lounge this time. At this point I had no idea why i was in the better lounge but had a decent breakfast there anyway. They turned up 90 minutes later as promised and i was off to the boarding gate. Short wait and then I was boarded and yikes the horrible 232 angle fault again. This was the longer leg and i was not looking forward to it. I was meant to be in 11F again same as the flight to Brisbane but when I looked at my boarding pass I had been moved to 1D. hallelujah, this cabin of BC seats had 1 row of First seats in row 1, 1 2 1 across. It was old style too but was a pod with a very long lie flat bed. I could stretch my hands fully above my head and my feet didn’t touch the end lying down (I’m 5ft 7, so someone over 6 foot would be comfortable in this seat too). There was loads of storage and the seat already had a mattress topper on it. same thin blanket though but the cabin was very warm.

Food and drink the same as the rest of the prestige cabin. I was overjoyed thogh not to have a 14 hour flight on those other seats.

Arrived on time at KLM and back to the Crown 52 lounge before boarding the final flight home. Arrived on time and passenger assitance had me through Immigration pretty quickly. had a bit of a wait for my bags and then we were off to the privat hire queue (black cabs no more at EDI).

In summary this worked ok, would have been worse but for the upgrade. Service is not as good as the likes of Qatar but very pleasant. Food a bit repetitive but still good. the price was excellent though.

Would I use them again? not sure. 2 things put me off a bit.
1. The prestige Suites are great and comparable to most good long haul airlines but the planes with the old style are not great at all. I don’t know if they are planning to change all their long haul ships to prestige Suites but if not, i likely would not book with them again
2. The arrangements with free landside hotel, particularly the return are really not great for those needing passenger assistance, especially if flying solo. That could be overcome by booking and paying for an airside transit hotel. Then there is the onboard aspect. Flight Attendants don’t seem to have had the same training as other airlines on dealing with visually impaired passengers. The safety briefing video was not accessible (more of a K Pop video) and crew never checked my understanding. Sure I could have asked but i didn’t as I know the drill. They also often put things down without letting me know. Just small stuff rally but if I compare to the 2 flights with KLM, where the FA checked what i could and couldn’t see, what help I needed, made sure i had understood the safety briefing, put glasses of drinks into my hand so I knew they were there and so on.

"Horrible, embarrassing and shocking in flight experience",Seoul,Vancouver,International,"I have travelled in many international flights in my entire career however this is one airline, i cannot forget due to the disappointment and harassments I have to face. Here are a few points I would want to share with everybody so that people can avoid this unprofessional airlines in their future travels- 
1. No Wifi -  Just before the web check in Korean airways claims that you can use the wifi, as it is clearly mentioned on their website. However. upon asking, the flight attendent refused saying there is no wifi in the plane. This looks pure deception to me as i wanted to watch my favourite match and even though i was ready to pay, the service isnt there. So why flash it on website wrongly?
2. No responsibility from flight attendant or airhostess- I requested the air hostess to kindly find me a suitable overhead cabin where i can put my laptop bag. She just smiled at me and said, we usually don't have any space in this place. Later, when i tried to check a cabin myself, she came again and said yes you can put it here. Every international flight has responsible attendants, who usually themselves help the passengers for their luggage. But I was shocked to see their attendants hardly caring for it. Honestly, it seemed i am travelling in a village bus.
3. The navigation screen given for each passenger is a mess. It doesnt have a good user interface for flight tour or map. It shows options for sky shopping and games, but the moment you open any of them, you see nothing inside. I even complained to one of the attendants about this, and he said they keep on updating this. So my question is for what kind of experience am i paying my hard earned money for if this flight has literally nothing to offer?
4. No proper food supplies - The flight had only beef curry in their evening menu by the time the food supplies reached me. The attendant adviced me to try the beef curry as there was nothing left on the food menu, which is extremely bizarre. I mean this is the first international flight i have experienced something like this. This airlines shouldn't not be rated more than 3 out of ten for the services i have received.
5. Harassment by the attendant- The flight attendant pushed me to have beef curry as they only had beef curry available. I told him that I don't eat beef and he said "" don't worry, you will like it, you can try"". I felt so harassed by such ignorance and such insensitive comments that I almost didnt feel safe for the rest of the flight and literally didnt even eat the next meal. People around me were kind to offer me their food because they could see the inhuman services however, no attendant was bothered. I mean, they could atleast share some substitue foods, snacks or even fruits that i could fill my tummy with, but to my surprise and harassments, nobody came. I was not being asked any food again for 5 hours approx. till the breakfast was served. Thats when i decided to tell the attendant that I need your name as soon as we land.

1st and last time travelling woth korean air. Sorry.,Singapore,Seoul,North Asia,"1. I originally booked a 1pm / 2pm return flight but was involuntarily cancelled by the airline. Korean air just cancelled the entire time slot! Does the airline has any commitment to the passengers. By then (notified in Aug), i was considering to switch to sq but sq prices has risen a lot form jun to aug. So i  stuck with korean air.

2. Departure Inflight meals have 2 choices. To my horror, both are spicy! Either bimbibap or chicken cooked in chinese chilli sauce. Maybe the problem is with me as my stomach cannot tolerate spices. I had to order takeaway from changi foodcourt jus to secure  my meal. Other special meals pre-departure doesnt catch my interest.

3. Flight time took longer. The plane spent 30min moving to the takeoff starting point at changi t4. What a waste of time! In total, flight time was 6h 35m. I check sq and actual readings was 6h 9m to 6h 25m, depending on different days.

4. Return inflight meals are spicy too. Either spicy octopus or black pepper chicken. Incheon t2 food court does not support takeaway. Had to takeawy carbonara from 7 eleven. Feels like a budget airline now. Ice cream was serced as dessert.

5. Again, upon touch down, plane took 15m to get to the gate. 

7. Flight entertainment was limited. Zero games and zero movies for kids. Adult movies were in english and korean. Sigh.

8. Incheon t2 airport took a long time to clear security checks.

9. This will be my first n last time travelling with travelling korean air. I dont mind paying more for sq, given the speed and food.

10. Other good points: pilots were skillful in smooth landing and takeoff. Turbulences were well-handled. Flight crew were helpful. Pax were also cooperatove and quiet.",November 2023,"November 21, 2023",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0

Never again!,Cebu Island,Los Angeles,International,"Never again and will never recommend Korean Air to anyoneWI know. I flew with Korean Air from Cebu to Los Angeles. I was about 8 weeks pregnant and had a bad morning sickness on board. After patiently waiting for my dinner (I was the last one they served food in my cabin), the FA said they only had one food left which is the green tea rice pudding. Now mind you, it wasn't my intention to be picky but I was very sick and I asked if they could at least give me an instant noodle in lieu of the rice pudding. The FA immediately declined my request as all they had was a green tea rice pudding. There wasn't even. This may sound a ridiculous complaint to others,  but to someone who is having a bad nausea, this is a huge thing. I've flown overseas many many times and I've never experienced an airline ran out of food, especially an international flight.

Service on Korean Air flights is fantastic, staff are so friendly and pleasant. Meals and in-flight entertainment were just fine, leg room and seat comfort good.

It was coded as a Delta flight but very happy it was Korean Air instead. Flight attendants nice and the food was decent. Would have been happier if they had served bi bim bap but they had both an Asian option (curry with rice) and a Western option (beef with potatoes). Overall the flights themselves were decent. My only issue was when I flew SGN to ICN, I got the airport about 4.5 hours before to SGN airport  and the sign board had said the KA flight was cancelled. Since no Korean staff were going to arrive till about 4 hour before the 12:15am flight, it was a lot of stress waiting to see if the flight was cancelled or not (it ended up not being cancelled and not sure why the sign board said that. Also know that if you are flying SGN to ICN, get in line early as everyone who checks in from Vietnam will have A LOT of boxes and luggage to check in.

Toronto to Manila (May 12-13) and return flight (Jun 9-10),Toronto,Manila,International,"I booked roundtrip economy tickets (YYZ-MNL) for 3 people about four months before our planned vacation.  Both trips included a short layover in Incheon. Korean Air economy tickets allowed for two checked bags, 23kgs each, and one carry-on, 10kgs, plus one personal item. We purchased new carry-on luggages for this trip because Korean Air measurements (total dimensions 115cm)  were smaller compared with other international carriers.  Plane seating structure is 3+3+3. Seat selection is free and can be done up to 361 days before the flight date but I mistakenly overlooked this--I only remembered to check a month before the trip and was lucky to still get 3 adjacent seats in all 4 flights. This was our first time flying with Korean Air.

Flight KE074, May 12, 12:40PM, Toronto to Incheon (YYZ-ICN):
Check-in and boarding experience went smoothly. Blanket and headphone provided. Complimentary bottled water, slippers, toothbrush and toothpaste. Each seat equipped with a touchscreen personal monitor. In lieu of the standard safety spiel, we got a bouncy K-pop in-flight safety video. Lots of movies to choose from, new and old, but no English subtitles unless it's Korean-made. Above average meals complete with cut fruits or salad, sometimes even dessert. I had bibimbap as my first meal, came with steamed rice, soybean paste soup, Gochujang hot sauce and sesame oil. Found out they do not serve apple juice, just orange juice. I've read about passengers asking for cup noodles so we gave that a try midflight. It's true, flight attendants do serve Shin Ramyun cup noodles upon request, fair warning though, there's only the spicy kind. Snack was deli meat sandwich. For the second meal, I chose chicken and potatoes which came with Caesar salad, bun, butter packet and slice of chocolate cake. I particularly like that we were provided with full size, stainless steel cutlery to use during meals. Underseat space in the middle seats (seats DEF) got a little crowded with our personal bags/backpacks and shoes which significantly impacted leg stretching space. 
 
Flight KE623, May 13, 6:55PM, Incheon to Manila (ICN-MNL):
No issues during check-in and boarding. Noticed that the B777-300 plane's personal monitor wasn't touchscreen so it was necessary to use the remote control. One full meal (2 or 3 choices) was served during the 4hr 10min flight. Halfway through the meal, we were given a small cup of Cledor cheesecake ice cream as dessert. Never had ice cream on a flight until now.

Flight KE624, Jun 9, 11:45PM, Manila to Incheon (MNL-ICN):
We were at NAIA Terminal 1 five hours before departure but our time was wasted queueing at the Korean Air counter which opened about two hours before our flight. Ground crew  were strict about the carry-on bag and asked economy passengers to measure and weigh their bags using a non-calibrated scale to the annoyance of some affected passengers. My family brought no carry-on bags on this flight so it didn't matter to us. After surviving the long wait and the extra long lines at NAIA security, we finally reached the transit lounge with one hour and 15min to spare. Boarding was a little chaotic but we were on the jet bridge by 11:22PM, plane took off at 12:03AM and we even arrived in Incheon ahead of schedule.

Flight KE073, Jun 10, 09:35 AM, Incheon to Toronto (ICN-YYZ):
Nearly same experience as with Flight KE074. However, this time we sat on the right side of the plane (seats GHJ) and underseat space seemed to be slightly more roomy compared to middle seats. No complaints.

Except for the disappointing check-in at NAIA in Manila, our experience with Korean Air was mostly favourable. Our layovers were short, 2hr 35min and 4hr 35min, respectively. We didn't have to claim and re-check our bags on the connecting flights in Incheon. Flight attendants were pleasant. We were fed well on every flight and their food was much better vs Delta Airlines or Philippine Airlines. Plane lavatories had adequate supplies. Safe take-offs and landings.

I already paid for one change to my flight, and this was also a ""change"".   The first change resulted in a significant fee.  Korean Air said due to this change, they would refund me, but since they couldn't figure out how to do it, they said they wouldn't pay the refund.   That's it.  They didn't pay.   I'll never fly this airline again and I recommend you don't either. (I forgot to mention that I spent countless time trying to resolve this issue.

"Great flight, comfy seat, exceptional crew",Seoul,Zurich,International,"Very comfortable flight. It's a long journey and a day flight, so time passes very slow.

After almost 8 hours of straight sleep, I woke up and asked the crew, if I could eat something. To my surprise, I was served the full lunch service which was very good. Another snack was served before landing. 
Seating on the B777 is 3-3-3 in economy with a very good seat pitch so the cabin feels really roomy. The flight wasn't full, so I had the middle seat next to me unoccupied which made sleeping even easier. Inflight entertainment and the lack of WiFi are the only weak spots of KE.

Prestige seats - you pay the money and don't get what you paid for,Auckland,London,International,"We flew to London and returned from Amsterdam.  Booked prestige class after lots of research and price comparisons.  When we booked the planes were 787 Auckland - Incheon return and 777-300 Incheon - London / Amsterdam - Incheon.  At the time of booking all aircraft offered the prestige suite seats which are the largest at 190cm - 180 degree lay flat - and best prestige seats available.  However nearer to the date of travel I received an email informing that the first flight was changed to a 777-200, the seat on this plane is prestige plus, only 152cm and 170 degree - I'm 193cm so not too impressed!  I wrote to complain and was advised that first class wasn't available on this flight but to ask if first class was available on check in - of course this was declined but only two seats in first class were occupied.
Then another email advised that the return flight to Auckland was changed to an A330 with a prestige sleeper seat, 188cm but the foot end is just a narrow foot support, but at least it was an improvement on 152cm!  I received a few other emails advising changes of flight times but this wasn't a problem.
Shortly before returning from Amsterdam yet another email advised of a change of selected seat but the seat number was the same.  So went to check and yet again a change of aircraft - still a 777-300 but with the prestige sleeper seat.  I emailed again to complain, requesting either compensation or upgrade to first, but just offered a refund on ticket price, the value of the refund for both of our tickets wouldn't have paid for one seat on another airline!  
So in summary only one aircraft out of 4 actually had a seat that we had originally booked and paid for.  Just be warned that if you book a plane with prestige suites you may not get what you think you paid for!

On the way back Manila to South Korea than Atlanta than to Toronto this is the time every thin went wrong an I believe Korean airlines knew all about it in advance just ripped us off so bad 
What happened my partner didn’t have USA visa on her Filipina passport they didn’t allow her to go on scheduled flight they told us she could go on next flight avoiding transit stop at Atlanta but  the  cost is almost $2300 plus for one way 
I did go alone thinking I paid for two seats and I will have more space and comfortable long flight but as soon as I got in the plane another passenger came in with the ticket same seat number I paid for it in advance I complained to flight attendant but she was confused and said she didn’t understand how Korean airline sold same seat to two different passengers and I should call Koran air to get my refund 
When I came back to Toronto I called and emailed to Korean air what they saying is agency misinformed us transfer passenger don’t need visa to enter USA not Korean airline and given one of my seats to another passenger no answer 
No reply on my request for compensation

Noise being a big triggers ,we requested a pre-boarding & seats  in quieter area of then plane. My request was never considered. The food was horrific!! I have seen tv dinners taste better than that. Service was terribly awful , rude flight attendants !! Its not  hard to notice The tone of voice & level of service provided to non-Korean’s vs the Korean travellers in the plane.  The whole crew : the ground & the air were oblivious to the DPNA services requested. Although it was clearly mentioned at the check ins  and indicated in the travellers profile. They would never acknowledge that. My child is 5 & half years old and would not wear a mask in the plane - the air-hostess insisted that we show a doctors note indicating he cant wear a mask. We are not anti maskers, we( both parents) were masked through out our trip. I would never travel with Korean airlines again. This airline is a budget airline , doesn't care about passengers & their needs.

Korean air flight had 2 DAYS delay, and they refused to refund anything, not even the hotel night at the airport. The reason! ""It was the airport's fault and not theirs"". 

Proof that Korean Air is not being fair to us. It took us two complaints to get a refund for our chargeable seats (that we never had)

I suggest you look for other airlines, such as nationally owned European companies. At least European legislation covers you for this sort of case.

Likely Not Flying Korean Again,Manila,Chicago,International,"Just returned to Chicago from Manila. Enjoyed the boarding process, leg room and price, I was surprised with the food and choices. Not so good.  Most frustrating were the multiple flight attendants scolding me and my adult son about not wearing or not wearing our face masks properly. Sure, Covid was a bit scary 30 months ago but not today. I was woken up multiple times insisting that I wear my mask. I was told the Korean Government required it. But at the airport in Korea, no one enforced masks. Our trip to Manila was on Qatar airlines and no one enforced masks and their food was excellent.

Not perfect but worth the higher fare,London,Manila,International,"I waited until my return flight before I wrote this review in case my inbound flight experience was different from my outbound flight. I can now say that both flights were extremely good and that it was worth paying a higher airfare.

Aircraft: Economy seats were wider and there was more legroom than most other airlines flying from London to Asia. Not much choice when it comes to the entertainment system but that did not bother me. Tip: use your own earphones (with a single jack) instead of the usual headphones with scratchy spongy covering -- the sound is better and you can move your head freely.

In-flight service: Flight attendants were quick to respond to requests. Toilets were kept clean. Pillows were fuller and fluffier than those you find in other airlines. 

Food: Amazing. They serve bibimbap (very good) and other Korean dishes. Upon request you can ask for snacks such as peanuts and instant noodles (Shin ramen). I had sausage and scrambled eggs for breakfast and was expecting the usual rubbery scrambled eggs (they can be difficult to perfect even at home, much more so in an airplane that just heats up the meal) -- I was pleasantly surprised that the scrambled eggs were fluffy and soft (wow).

Pre-flight: I love how their website shows you the seat plan for your particular flight even before you book your seat (which you can reserve right after booking). 

Can be improved: flight from Manila was delayed by an hour but they made the announcement quite late. They should also announce at check-in that they require the use of face masks all throughout the flight -- they only do so once you board the aircraft, prompting some passengers to search their bags for a face mask. KAL does provide face masks for those who did not bring any, but it's always best to keep passengers informed beforehand. 

Final verdict: I will fly KAL again.",December 2022,"January 25, 2023",5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0

Worst flying experience ever,Portland,Seoul,International,"On the early morning of 12/30 my flight was scheduled to leave pdx to icn via seattle.  However, at the ticket counter, the delta staff told me that my flight is not until 12/31.  Keep in mind, that my original flight schedule was 12/31 however, my wife had changed ticket to 12/30.  Without no other option, i could not fly out on 12/30. When i confirmed with korean air regarding flight, they confirmed that my flight ticket was confirmed for 12/31.  Therefore, on the 31st.  I arrived at pdx and checked in as usual.  The staff at ticket counter told me everything was ok.  However, when i got through security check point, and to the gate…. During boarding my ticket was not accepted.  Then staff at delta stopped me and told
Me i had to ticket for the current flight.  I ended up missing that flight.  I was in panic mode because everything terrible about this flying experience was restarting.  First being told i had ticket and then later being told that i didn’t.  I don’t know how airlines work but they somehow miscommunicated between delta and korean air.  My original booking was through Korean air therefore i am assuming Korean air is liable for this screw-up.  I called korean air again and they told me that they were not sure why i couldn’t get on the original flight.  They told me to find staff at ticket counter but no one was available.  They advised me to quickly leave the on boarding gate area and to go out and quickly re- process the flight ticket.  Which meant, check-in again at the ticket counter outside as if i just arrived at the airport.  I angrily left….. and sprinted across pdx and then luckly there was a short line at delta counter.  Quickly explained, and obviously informed them about what happened a couple hours earlier.  Korean air had talked to delta and somehow this time they authorized to give me a flight ticket to seattle….. at first, the delta flight attendant told me that i might miss my connecting flight from seattle to incheon because if there not enough time, i might fly out of seattle from 11:45pm rather than the scheduled 11:40am seattle to icn.  Even when i boarded my flight from pdx to seattle… my ticket beeped again and they had me wait to confirm
Something without telling me
What the issue was….. eventually i boarded the plane from Pdx to seattle on 12/31/2022.  Missing my original flight on 12/30/2022.  Due to their mistake i arrived a day late which caused me to go back and fourth between my home and on top of that i arrived a day late which made me miss out on an important family reunion on new year’s day.  The worst of all, i did not get a clear explanation as to why i missed my flight on the 30th my original scheduled flight.  And why i had missed my flight on 12/31 again the following day and i couldn’t board on the airplane until the next flight out of pdx to seattle.  All this emotional drama has led me to have a lot less trust in how korean air functions.  Usually they are known for their customer service but they truly need to reconsider how they organize their booking information.  They don’t seem to really care about what used to be stellar customer service.  I better look for another flight next time around.",December 2022,"January 10, 2023",1.0,,,,,,,,

"TREATED LIKE FIRST CLASS PASSENGERS, WHILE SITTING IN ECONOMY",Dallas,Seoul,International,"My wife and I traveled to Korea, and back to the United States, both on KOREAN AIRLINES, this is an amazing airlines from the moment we had contact with their employees at check in at both airports to the moment we left both terminals.  My wife had recently undergone a pretty big back surgery, so we elected to use wheel chair service, as her back was bothering her when we got to the airport.  It was one of the best decisions we made, we were escorted the entire way to our gate, and down the jetway, all the while their employees not only pushing the wheel chair but also our numerous and heavy pieces of luggage, all the while refusing any help from me, any questions we had at check in were quickly and accurately answered, when I thanked one of KOREAN AIR representatives for her help, she politely replied with ""thats my job"", once out of the jet way, and on the airplane a flight attendant escorted us to our seats which were twords the rear of the airplane, took the 3 pieces of carry on we had and put them in the overhead storage for us, again refusing any help from us.  On each seat in economy was a pillow, blanket, bottle of water, headset, and a small bag containing slippers, toothbrush, and a small tube of tooth paste.  Also the economy seat was very comfortable, and did NOT feel cramped at all.   The inflight cabin service was tremendous, the airplane was very full, and the flight attendants were working hard, but promptly arrived at your seat when you called them, or just when walking by they intentionally would make eye contact with you, to see if you required any thing, all the while with a smile on their faces.  Two complete meals during the flight that were delicious, served warm, and promptly, also several snacks served, more if you asked for them after they were served, and all alcohol was free of charge, in economy seating no less.  This amazing service repeated itself upon arrival at our destinations with KOREAN AIR employees meeting us on the jetway, and escorting us all the way to customs, this required some physical work, as both airport terminals were very big, and required a lot of walking, again they refused any assistance from me to help push and or carry any of our luggage.  This was a round trip, and true to form the same first class service repeated itself on our departure form Korea, for the US on KOREAN AIR FLIGHT NUMBER 041 (KE041).  Sorry for such a long post, but we cannot say enough positive things about this company, if you have the opportunity to fly KOREAN AIR LINES, you will not regret it, save your money for your destination, and fly economy, you will be treated right, by a top notch airline, and their employees both in the air, and on the ground, they are what make KOREAN AIR LINES great, KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!",November 2022,"December 22, 2022",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
Customer Service? There is no such thing at Korean Air,Seoul,Bangkok,Southeast Asia,"This was like any other budget  airline. It serves its purpose without the bells and whistles until you actually need assistance. 

My luggage was missing which was a problem but it was exacerbated by the total lack of assistance, care or concern by Korean Air staff.

My original flight was with Delta Airline originating from Atlanta with a Korean Air connecting flight in Seoul. I wait endlessly for my luggage before I spot an agent holding a sign with my name on it. 

She first tells me my bag was damaged but when she was completing the form she checking missing. I asked questions of course which she completely ignored like I was talking to myself. Frustrated I asked the other two agents what happened and received minimal help from them. I was told my bags would be delivered to my hotel at midnight. The when and how of it all still in question.

Midnight comes and goes. I start chatting with Delta and around 2am to learn that my bags were separated and would be arriving on two different flights. I was pushed off on Korean Air although from my perspective if was Delta's mistake as my luggage was still coming from America.

Korean Air made things worse.  The three customer service numbers to the local airport went unanswered. It was important for me to reach someone because the agent did not include the address on the form so the courier would not know which big name global hotel I was in. 

I called Korean Air for assistance. The agent just wanted me to continue to call the numbers I was given. I insisted he try a different number to reach local staff. Which he did and I was able to reach someone at 8:15am. I informed the courier who arrived around noon that I would be changing hotels and to provide the new information for my second delivery. He did not update anyone and bags were attempted to be delivered to my first hotel.

Korean Air showed no care or concern. The agent was very disrespectful when she ignored my questions. She acknowledged she heard and understood them. She just would not answer me and did not make any attempt to get someone to help if language was a reason for it.",December 2022,"December 8, 2022",1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

Ripped off!,Seoul,Washington DC,International,"I had purchased an upgraded ticket to business class with my KAL points.  I was charged additional fees for taxes for the upgraded seat which I was fine with.  Trip to Korea, I received the business class, but trip back to US, they said seats were overbooked so they have to put me into economy.  Not happy about it, but accepted their reason since I was upgrading with points.  I asked about the refund for taxes which the counter person told me but he was bit hesitant, so I called the customer service and they said funds will be refunded.  What's worse, I was allowed total of 6 luggage to send with my wife, but economy only allows 4 for 2 people.  Anticipating we will be in business class, we brought 5 luggage.  We told the rep we had 5 bags and he didn't mention anything about additional fee.  When we were about to put the 5th bag through, he then tells us there is addition 200k won (~$150) for the 10kg bag.  I told him no and I will carry it on since it was a small bag.  Then, my wife realized there were lot of liquids in that last bag so we had no choice but to ship it.  If this was told at the beginning before sending through 4 luggage, we could have made it into 4 luggage as we had plenty of room.

When I arrived at the states, I called the travel agent who booked the flight and asked how long refund usually takes.  She then goes to tell me no refund is due where I was befuddled.  Something doesn't make sense, and I wouldn't normally post complaints like this, but I just feel like I have been ripped off and lied to.  Lying about seats being overbooked when I took a peek through business class where few seats were vacant and handful of economy seats were available.  If their policy is not to refund for the additional taxes I had paid for business class, it clearly makes sense why they didn't give me the upgrade.  I've been using Korean Air credit card for past three years to be able to utilize the points, but my trip back was very upsetting experience!

However, the Kosmo Suite 2.0 in 777 was much more private space as it has the closing doors to make the suite fully enclosed feeling. The first class experience starts at the airport in ICN (Terminal 2) as there is a dedicated check in lounge just for first class passengers. Check in lounge is quiet, with wide screen tv and coffee and drink selection. This is strictly a first class lounge just for ticketing pre-security on land side. Drop off the checked baggage here, too. Just leave it here, the ticket agents who will come to you as you are seated in sofa will tag the bags and send it for you (so you basically don't have to move a finger). After receiving your tickets, go through security and go straight to the lounge (First Class lounge was closed at the time due to covid, got to use Miler Club).

Disappointing services from a 5 star airline,Ulaanbaatar,Seoul,North Asia,"I was denied boarding in Ulaanbaatar until I purchased an additional ticket which I did not use. The Korean Air staff at the Ulaanbaatar airport is not aware of the Seoul airport's automated transfer between Terminal 1 and 2. Since I had a connecting flight leaving from Incheon Terminal 1 I was told by the Korean Air staff, incorrectly, that only a few airlines have a transfer desk at Incheon Airport. WRONG! THE TRANSFER IS AUTOMATED, JUST NEED TO SWIPE THE PASSPORT. So I was forced to purchase a Vietnam Airlines ticket which I did not use - since the transfer desk is closed anyway.

Worse, the Ulaanbaatar staff never bothered to call Seoul to ask about the transfer details. Instead, they pushed me aside from the check-in counter and continued playing games on their phones. Very unprofessional.

They keep information from you,London,Seoul,International,"They charge for absolutely anything. Changing multi city flights can only be done over the phone and the people you have to speak to on the phone don't seem to know what they're doing so you have to TRUST them with your money otherwise changes can't be made. It's different stating these policies customers should know CLEARLY so it isn't a challenge for customers to find this information, but it's a different story if important information about fees is extremely difficult to understand and find on the website - that's just going to lead to confusion for the customer, and if your customer service is difficult to get accurate information from, then it's going to be even more difficult to know where you're putting your money towards.",July 2022,"July 21, 2022",1.0,,,,1.0,1.0,,,
AVOID AVOID AVOID you have to pay £30 per call from the UK!,London,Seoul,International,"Poor customer service! How difficult is it to just upgrade the outbound flights for a multiway journey from economy to prestige? Apparently for korean airlines it is impossible! 

You are not able to amend multi way flights online, so I spoke to an advisor over the phone to upgrade the flights he initally quoted a price that I thought was reasonable and so I paid for it. The only fees he mentioned was the service fee for upgrading the flight tickets which I thought was reasonable and I agreed to pay. But then I was double charged, as I was charged on the payment method I used online initally to pay for the original tickets and the payment I made over the phone for the upgrade. 

When I called again to see why I was double charged I was accused of lying by another person on the phone, and he said that on their system it shows that I was charged less than what I was actually charged. I told them I was willing to send them a screenshot of the transactions to show that I wasn't lying. I was told to email the screenshots to the supervisor. He also quoted a different price to the first person for the same upgrade. 

So I cancelled the flights due to the bad customer service, but because of the penalty fees I have lost out on £600! For tickets that I didn't use! It doesn't help that everyone I have spoken to have been so rude, unhelpful, and the supervisors are blaming me for not doing my research about the penalty fees! They also blamed me because as I agreed to pay the service fee for the upgrade, that meant I agreed to pay the other fees but they weren't mentioned in the phone call! No where online can I find the information for cancellation fees for multiway flights and the fees for calling the helpline! It doesn't help that the supervisor had stopped responding to my emails and didn't appear to acknowledge what was said in them. 

So in the penalty fee I am being charged is the cancellation fee (£175 per ticket), service fee for the upgrade (£85) and then the fees for calling korean air (£30 per call) from the UK! And if I wanted the tickets back I would have to pay £230!",July 2022,"July 20, 2022",1.0,,,,,,,,

Uncomfortable seats,Bangkok,Seoul,North Asia,Hey guys I usually don't take the time to make reviews but in this case I feel like I need to do it. I'm also contacting Korean Air to let them know my dissatisfaction. I am a realist so I'm going to tell you exactly the experience. First of all the staff on the plane are very polite. In fact a little bit too much in this case. I was seated in economy and I must tell you the seats are not comfortable for long flights. Take that with a grain of salt if you decide to purchase a ticket. I had this very rude woman sitting in front of me. It's no problem to recline your seat because that's what it's for. But when meal Time came she refused to place the seat in its upright position so that I could lower my table and have the meal. I told the stewardess who was a man can you please ask the person sitting in front of me to move their seat forward so that I don't have the table squishing me in my lap? I am 6'3 so it's not easy being tall. She protested and complained. She moved her seat forward for about 10 seconds after a long argument with the stewardess. As soon as he walked away she slammed the seat backwards as far as it would go. instead of having an altercation on the plane which I'm more than capable of doing I decided to take the higher ground and let it go. The problem that I have with the airline is they did not do their job making the customer comply with the rules. I'm very considerate of people around me on planes. I think it's more than reasonable to have the seat forward so that you can have a meal without being squished. Although the staff is very polite it can work against you so be careful. You have to make them do their job if something is not going the way it's supposed to.,April 2022,"April 27, 2022",2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0

After waiting 3 hrs for our flight they pulled us out of line, we missed our flight all due to their incorrect interpretation of the Thai rules. Although I showed them on the Thai immigration site that we could enter within 72 hours of the date that was ok'd by Thai immigaration they would not let us board. We would actually arrive 1 hour before the date that was ok'd by the Thai gov't.  We had to spend the night at the airport and take another airline the following day.

Worst cabin crew from Korea airport to LA,Phnom Penh,Los Angeles,International,"would like to thank Korean Air for providing me safe flight to meet my husband in LA. However, I’m very disappointed with cabin crew from Incheon airport to LA. I am a mother traveling with two girls. A 5 years old girl with slide behavior problems and a 2 and half years old girl. In the beginning of the flight itself one cabin crew with short hair came to instructed me to wear face mask for my babies. I did all the ways and try my best to put face mask on them as I also scare of the spreading to my little angels. (I am vaccinated and wear face mask in my entire flight). 11 hours flight 3 cabin crew came to wake me up to put face mask on my sleeping girls. I couldn’t count but 11 hours I couldn’t take even an hour rest. Before this flight I just take 5 hours flight from PP and layover almost 13 hours. I was extremely exhausted and couldn’t rest at all. The short hair cabin crew rudely tell me, it is my responsibility as a mother to make them wear face mask all the way, otherwise she would report to the police officer in the US that I break the law since US require child 2 years plus to put on face mask. I told her, I have tried but children feel uncomfortable and removed and screaming and crying. She told this is her duty to make my children wear face mask, I told her I completely understand her but what can I do if they scream and pulling it out each time I put it on. I told her I need rest please. I begged her to try to understand my situation but 3 of them didn’t let me rest at all. They try to read US law to my babies and took video of that, that the worst part I couldn’t bare. Finally we arrived the US pot, yes two police officers were waiting for us, I couldn’t go to the immigration check. Another Korean lady read what the cabin crew have note to the US officer, she even reported that my girl kick the front seat and trying to push and punched her. 2 police officer only asking, if the mother wear face mask, they say yes. Yes I did. Than they said what the problem. I can see their facial expression after hearing what such heartless carbine crew report. They have no problem at all because they understood that they are small kids. She was not satisfied, in between she came and complaining that my girl show violence on her. I told her I am sorry for her misbehavior but she was not even touch her. Then she look a bit ashamed and no words to say. I don’t blame the company but I blame to cabin crew who is heartless and stupidly trying to impress her boss how good she is. Finally, the Korea lady in the US airport understand my hard time so she help me to push my smaller baby through the immigration till the baggage claim. I thanks her for that but I swear I will never travel by Korea Air again if I have options.",June 2021,"November 5, 2021",1.0,,,,,,,,

"Hellish Experience with Korean Air, almost stranded me twice",Tokyo,Seoul,North Asia,"I got a great deal with another airline to fly to Japan, so I decided I would book a second round trip ticket to continue on to Korea. Literally on the day I was flying they changed my ticket, not only to a differnet time but to a different airport (Narita) 4 hours away! Even if I somehow made it to Narita the return time they gave me was so late I would have missed my other flight back home.

It literally MAKES 0 SENSE, if you are going to rebook a customer without consent, shouldn't you at least 1) give 24 hours notice  2) choose an EARLIER time than the original time 3) STICK TO THE SAME AIRPORT???

I was so shocked when this happened, and I wouldn't have known about it had I nto happened to check my email (yes, they dont notify by text, they send an email).  I rushed over to the counter at Haneda for help and they were super unhelpful. I was told my only other option was a business class upgrade on a flight TWO DAYS earlier than my original return time. 

They didn't even comp the upgrade, even though this was THEIR ISSUE, that is how crappy their customer service is, they don't care about their customers at all which is why they apparently almost went bankrupt at one point. So not only did i have to shell out hundreds, I also had to cut my trip 2 days early and suddenly find lodging for 2 days in Japan and THEN travel 4 hours from the city they decided to stick me i n order to get to Haneda.

Around this time I also heard news Japan was implementing a travel ban on visitors from Korea so about 2 hours after I booked the ticket I decided to cancel,  they said they couldn't cancel it for me because it was an upgrade and they told me I had to wait till I fly to Korea and get help there (I was still in Haneda at this point waiting to fly to Korea, my return trip was still 2.5 weeks away). It makes 0 sense why they couldn't cancel. 

Upon my arrival to Korea I purchased an international sim and made over a hundred attempts to speak to someone, I  called the Japanese, English, Korean toll lines, at all hours, every attempt which had me waiting on the phone for 30-1 hour ended with a voicemessage saying noone was reachable due to volume.

I tried reaching out on Facebook and Twitter either to be ignored or told this wasn't the right avenue. I emailed them, sent messages on their customer complaint center (these messages were replied to, with no apology, 3 months later). I finally took the train for an hour to speak to their staff at Incheon Airport ony to be told they couldnt help me because the upgrade was done in Japan. Again, it makes 0 sense why staff working for the SAME company in 2 different countries can't work the same ticket. 

When I got home to the US, after being forced to shell out thousands more for a ticket on a different airline (Japan had an entry ban at this point with a mandatory 14 day quarantine not to mention almost all flights were canceled from Korea to Japan) I had to call my bank to dispute this charge. I finally got my money back..or so I thought..in June.

Combing through my finances I see they've charged me A SECOND TIME suddenly in August, and my bank tells me it looks like they tried to sneak it on there because its for different amount and they did it as separate transaction (which is why the agent at my bank had a hard time finding it as first).

I called Korean Air and was actually able to talk to someone this time who talked over me the whole time,  argued how none of the above was Korean Air's fault bc of Covid (so Covid made you guys charge me twice? Covid made you NOT comp the upgrade i had to get bc YOU suddenly changed my ticket? Covid made your staff at two airports incompetent?) and NONE of this was resolved still because she said I had to email their customer support with my claim. 

Throughout this entire ordeal NOT one person apologized for the horrible experience I have had dealing with their company.",March 2020,"December 27, 2020",1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0

Korean airways Phnom Penh employees stole my luggage,Phnom Penh,Seoul,North Asia,"I had a flight booked on December 4th leaving Phnom Penh at 11:45pm going to South Korea.

The female rep then walked away and told a strange man to assist me. The man wrote on a piece of paper I needed to pay 1,500 for my checked bag fee. Another man came over and said it is $50 for 1kg. I then proceeded to take items out of my bag which only weighted 22kg at the time. I told the man I only had $200 in cash and could not afford to pay. They then all igroned me and at 11:29 the man said I either pay them $1,500 or I can not check in my 2nd bag I explained that these were the only clothes I have and if I could please pay them $200 another man said I could pay him $400 I told him I only have $200 and he said it's the airline policy and that it is very expensive to check a bag in. With only 15mins before departure the group of con artist told me I cannot check in my bag and if I wanted my things I needed to pay $1,500. I was then granted my boarding pass after saying I can't pay and then was forced to leave the ONLY clothes I had. After this I researched and found out I only needed to pay $100 for 23kg for a 2nd checked bag. The employees of korean airways located in Phnom Penh stole my clothes leaving me absolutely nothing.

Flight during Covid-19,New York City,Seoul,International,"In April, Covid-19 continued affecting New York severely. Many incoming and outgoing NY flights were cancelled or double/triple the price to travel. However, Korean Air continued to operate professionally. The staff members were able to explain the protocol before getting onboard. Also, the ticket price was a little more affordable than the usual Korean Air ticket price, usually considered a bit more expensive as its service quality is known to be good. This plane was almost packed while the airport seems to be completely empty- almost believed if Korean Air is the only one flying from the airport.

Flight partially fine Service and communication a MESS,Frankfurt,Auckland,International,"The first part of the flight was okay. The entertainment system is compared to other airlines not really good. The service on plane is like they let you feel you are not a person from Korea but somewhere else. 
The biggest mess and also the reason for my rating is how this airline communicates how unresponsive they are. We were unfortunally travelling during Corona Virus outbreak. We were able to reach our destination (Auckland) but our flights back were cancelled and the only info we got was short email that the flight back (normally Auckland to Seoul, layover 2 days and Seoul to Frankfurt) will now start in Sydney and one day earlier. After trying to reach Korean Air we received the cancellation for the second leg and the info we would fly from Seoul now to Amsterdam and not Frankfurt. We contacted them again but no reply. We spend all free minutes on our NZ prepaid card plus asked a familiy memeber to Korean (he spend 7 hours! on phone with no success). Finally i reached one of their call centers in the US and they offered to me a 50 hours flight from Auckland to Sydney to Kuala Lumpur to Amsterdam and from there to Frankfurt. I asked for a partially refund which they approved. Now one month has past after we arrived back home and i have heard nothing from Korean Air. I called them today in germany and got the info that i have to call the call center in Asia as they work on the refund there...so i tried that call center with the result that the line is so bad that it is impossible to speak to the agent, the Korean online portal gives no option for contacting them directly. The chat does not work at all, on social media (facebook) you are told they cannot help. I am not sure right now but i think next time we go with a different airline even if we fly to South Korea to visit it.",February 2020,"April 20, 2020",1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0
Disappointing onboard services,Seoul,Phuket,Southeast Asia,"I heard a lot of hype on how good Korean Air would be. Sadly, it didn't live up to the hype. The good thing about Korean Air is the flight attendants are gorgeous and very well manicured. They have high standards and represent the face of carrier with perfection. Onboard is a different story. Culturally the flight attendants are very timid. It's almost impossible to hear them when they speak. Good luck understanding what is being offered for snacks or dinner. If there are loud groups of passengers they are not able to control. When flying on long flights its is important to be well hydrated. They serve pre-poured water in Dixie cups. The meals are not appetizing to the western traveler. Highly recommend bringing on sandwich and snacks to make it through the flight. Buy water in the airport. The onboard entertainment is pathetic. There are about 8 total choices of movies for flights over 6 hours.  The bathrooms are vey small and went maintained during flight. The seats are not as comfortable as other carriers. The onboard decor is muted and unappealing. There is no option to upgrade to other classes of services.

Flight experience excellent but left em stranded,Chicago,Hanoi,International,"Had paid for round trip from Chicago/ Hanoi Vietnam Feb 25th to March 11th.  Had short layover in Seoul Korea.  Received message per email that could NOT leave from Hanoi but must leave March 10th from Ho Chi Ming city.  My cost around 70 dollars for flight there. About one week before our departure date, we found out by accident that KAL had NO flights in our out from Vietnam.  Tried to contact KAL and unsuccessful.  Was able to find flight with JAL.  Had pay full fair to get back a little over 680 dollars. Contacted  KAL with the 1-800 number we had with email. the US,  and the person who answered was very nice, and said KAL would give me 1/2 of my ticket price back, but not to expect it for at least 12 weeks.  Not once did I get an apology.  I should have said in the beginning that I had contacted KAL,  I was told that KAL WOULD FIND A WAY TO GET ME HOME AT THEIR EXPENSE, BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT KAL DOES.  I am just out that 750 dollars if KAL goes bankrupt.  I do understand the problem KAL i did have related to Coronavirus, my problem is the extreme poor communication.  KAL should have at least informed us of their problem.  As for flight to Vietnam I would give KAL 4 out of 5.  Communication 1 out of 5. For giving me (if I get it) any money 4 out of 5-----this is because of the ticket I paid for, apparently they could owe me nothing per their contract.",February 2020,"April 8, 2020",2.0,,,,,,,,

The ratio of the food was also great and filling. I so much loved their service that I signed up for their rewards program since I’m looking forward to fly with them again.

The flights didn’t end up going and I would have been stuck in Bangkok. I figured they would at least refund me for the flight that never went out.

Hours and hours on hold, emails with only half the information, emails that had i followed the instructions I would have been stranded in Korea.

A nice experience,Washington DC,Denpasar,International,"I had four flights with KE for my trip. Each leg was just fine, but they really have some close time tables. The hospitality was lovely on all legs of my trip. Although word to the wise - if you have a dietary need, call early and get those arrangements made. If you specifically avoid diary, like I do, order the vegan meal. Their low/no lactose meal, had items that are items I don't eat, because they have dairy. Also note - if you're on a long flight and prefer more comfort, level up your seats when you make the reservations. I attempted at several points in my flight to upgrade and it was severely impossible. If you have a tight turn around flight (less than 40 minutes) they have a concierge waiting for you to get you to the next flight on time. If you do have a turn around time, be ready to run. It was 3 miles from plane to plane on one of my legs. (I was in the international terminal - connecting between two countries. Everything was clean and orderly and relatively comfortable.

A área do check-in da classe executiva conta com ótima estrutura no aeroporto de Seul ICN com atendimento rápido, cortez e diferenciado. Empoucos minutos nossa bagagem já havia sido despachada e encontravamos a caminho da sala vip para aguardar o voo. A aeronave em questão era um Boeing 777-300 com alguns sinais de uso mas nada que desabonasse a companhia e a ótima experiência. A classe executiva estava confugurada num layout 2-3-2 já antigo, oferecendo pouca privacidade para quem escolhe os assentos centrais entretanto dispunha de bom espaço entre as poltranos e as mesmas na posição cama ficavam full flatbad. O voo teve duração de apoximadamente seis horas e foi servido lanche e depois serviço de jantar completo com entrada, prato principal e sobremesa (tanto o lanche quanto o jantar estavam deliciosos, o prato de carne estava no ponto perfeito).

O atendimento da equipe de bordo foi extremamente cortez e simpático, estando os comissários sempre dispostos a atender solicitações dos passageiros. A prioridade de embarque, desembarque e recolhimento de bagagem funcionou muito bem.

Com certeza segue o padrão de altíssima qualidade das companhias asiáticas em que o cliente é bem atendido durante todo o processo, desde o chek-in até o recolhimento de bagagem.

Obviamente voltaria a voar com a companhia mas priorizando aviões com um layout mais moderno, preferencialmente no padrão 1-2-1.

Korean Air offers differentiated service from the beginning. The business class check-in area has an excellent structure at Seoul ICN airport with fast, courteous and differentiated service. Within a few minutes our luggage had already been checked and we were on our way to the VIP room to wait for the flight. The aircraft in question was a Boeing 777-300 with some signs of use but nothing to disrupt the company and the great experience. The business class was configured in an old 2-3-2 layout, offering little privacy for those who choose the central seats. However, there was a good space between the seats and the same ones in the bed position were full flatbad. The flight lasted approximately six hours and was served a snack and then full dinner service with starter, main course and dessert (both the snack and dinner were delicious, the meat dish was in the perfect spot).

The attendance of the on-board staff was extremely courteous and friendly, with the flight attendants always willing to attend to requests from passengers. Priority boarding, disembarking and baggage retrieval worked very well.

It certainly follows the very high quality standard of Asian companies in which the customer is well served during the entire process, from check-in to baggage claim.

Best stopover program,Brisbane,London,International,"I had previously flown with Asiana, Korea's premier airline, which had the same program with superior service, so this was my first time with Korean Air.

I chose them primarily as it's the most civilised way to get from Australia to Europe: a 10 hour day flight, a 16 hour stopover that includes transfers to and from the stopover hotel, then another 10 hour day flight. 

Previously it was a random hotel, now everyone goes to the Grand Hyatt Incheon, which is a major upgrade. (Note, you need to secure the hotel at the time of ticket booking.)

The flight from Brisbane to Seoul was a light load, so there were extra seats available and the service was fine.

The stopover was brilliant, with a lovely hotel room and a fabulous breakfast after a proper night's sleep. 

The transfers went well and the second flight was at capacity, so no extra room, but the service was very good, the inflight entertainment had a good selection and being able to look through cameras at the ground or from the cockpit was novel.

There is a 17-hour layover in the flights they gave me. Arriving in Incheon Airport at 5:30 p.m. on Day 1  and leaving for Washington, DC the next day at 10:30 a.m. or 17 hours wait!

I asked the porters for suggestions on what to do in 17 Hours. Leaving the airport as transients is not allowed. Cost of 12 hours stay at a hotel inside the airport is $140!

They suggested using their Transfer Lounge called, NAP ZONE. It has about 15 comfortable beds discreetly separated by dividers. Nearby are restrooms and a Coffee Shop that open for 24 hours. More stores and shops are located at the Lower Level. I decided to stay there, made me rested and ready for the next flight home.

INSIDE THE PLANE: Staff were helpful and friendly. We were served 2 meals, one on Day 1,  the other one on Day 2. Compared to my previous Korean Air Flights that leave at midnight, Staff of my flights did not go around offering water between meals. I had to get up from my seat and ask for water. Not a big deal for me.

Conclusion: Will continue  to use this airline for my future travels in Asia.",March 2020,"March 7, 2020",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

Short flight with the very friendly crew,Jeju,Busan,Domestic,"Korean Air deploys the narrow-body B737-800 for this flight from Jeju to Busan. There are a total of 12 Business Class seats and 135 Economy Class seats on the Korean Air B737-800 jet. Economy Class seats are arranged in a 3-3 configuration. The use of orange lighting in the Economy Class cabin exudes a feeling of warmth and comfort, which is perfect for this early morning flight. Seats in Economy Class are decked out in blue fabric, which is the same as other Korean Air aircraft.

I did not have the chance to visit the Lavatory as seat belt sign remained turned on throughout the entire 1 hour flight time from Jeju to Busan was on throughout the entire flight.

Seats in the Economy Class on Korean Air have a 33"" pitch and 17"" wide and are rather comfortable for a short 1-hour flight from Jeju to Busan. Seat reclined button is located on the side of the armrest of the seat, which allows seats to recline to a maximum of 113º. The legroom of the Economy Class seats on the B737-800 is quite good for a narrowbody aircraft. The seats look rather dated and scream of a need for refreshing.

Each seat comes with a single-piece tray table which is large enough to place a 15"" laptop on. However, these tray tables seem redundant as no food is being served on this short domestic flight. There is a cup holder fixed on the back of the tray table, allowing passengers to place their cups without having the need to deploy the tray table. Reading lights and attendant call buttons are located on the ceiling above the seats. This is where air vent for each seat is also found.

Lights and air vents are located on the ceiling above eat seat in Economy Class
The seat pocket onboard the Korean Air B737-800 is big enough for passengers to place their tablets into. Each seat pocket comes with a small compartment inside the seat pocket, which is great for passengers to store smaller items into. The seat pockets contain the usual inflight literature and aircraft safety card.

There are no In-Flight Entertainment System installed on this Korean Air B737-800 jet. There are drop-down screens installed on the ceiling of the aircraft, mainly used for playing safety videos. These screens are not in use throughout the 1 hour flight time from Jeju to Busan. There seem to be some radio facilities installed on the armrest of each seat, but no earphones are being distributed nor are these radios being turned on. The only form of entertainment onboard this Korean Air B737-800 are the inflight magazines found in the seat pocket.

As soon as the aircraft reached cruising altitude, the air stewardesses went around distributing beverages. No food is being provided to passengers flying this domestic route.

Despite being a domestic flight, the service on Korean Air B737-800 is rather good. Pursuers are seen helping passengers locate their seats and stowing their carry-on baggage in the overhead bin. Beverage distribution is always done with a smile on the faces of the pursuers. The pursuers are also seen patrolling the cabin several times during the 1-hour flight, helping passengers clearing the used cups. At the end of the flight, the pursuers thanked the passengers for flying with Korean Air with a warm smile at the door as we deplane.

The Economy Class onboard Korean Air B737-800 is good for a short. 1-hour flight. The seats are comfortable and the legroom is good. The lack of Inflight Entertainment did not bother us as this is a short flight and time pass by very quickly onboard. Pursuers are friendly and seen to be helping passengers. For a short flight, flying on this Korean Air B737-800 does the job of transporting us from Jeju to Busan.",October 2019,"March 4, 2020",4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0
Good for a short domestic flight,Seoul,Jeju,Domestic,"For our flight between Gimpo and Jeju, Korean Air uses the A330-300 aircraft. Korean Air A330-300 comes in two-class service: Prestige and Economy. There a total of 24 cacoon type Business Class seats that can be fully reclined into flatbed and 252 Economy Class seats segregated into two sections. The cabin is bright and the use of blue fabric on the Economy Class seats exudes a feeling of calmness. Seats in Economy Class are arranged in a 2-4-2 configuration.

Lavatories for Korean Air A330-300 Economy Class passengers are located in the mid and aft part of the aircraft. The lavatory is basic but clean, thanks to the use of white colour on the walls that makes the lavatory look bigger than its actual size. The amenities in the Economy Class lavatory onboard Korean Air A330-300 is very basic with only tissues, hand soap and paper cups.

The Economy Class seats onboard Korean Air A330-300 Economy Class shows signs of ageing with a hint of yellowish on the seats. All Economy Class seats come with a standard 32"" pitch, however as I was sitting at the bulkhead seat, I was treated with a seat pitch of 33"". All Economy Class seats measure 18"" wide and have seat recline of 118°. As this is a short domestic flight, no pillows or blankets are available in the Economy Class seats.

Legroom is very good at the bulkhead seat onboard Korean Air Economy Class
As I was seated at the bulkhead, the tray table is stowed in the armrest of the seat. The bi-fold tray table is large enough to cover the entire width of the seat. Seat pockets are installed on the bulkhead with the standard inflight shopping catalogue and Korean Air's inhouse magazine - Morning Calm. The reading light is found on the ceiling of the seat.

Each seat in the Economy Class is equipped with a 10.6"" Personal TV, as I am sitting in the bulkhead seat, the TV is stowed at the side of the seat. Deploying the TV is a breeze with a press of a button and swivel the TV to the angle for viewing. the Inflight Entertainment (IFE) controller is found on the inner side of the sit. The controller looks old school and has some very easy to use buttons. On top of controlling the IFE, the call buttons and reading light buttons are also found on the IFE controller. On the back of the controller is where one can find a qwerty keyboard and some action buttons. I find these buttons are a tad too small to be useful. Despite being fitted a Personal TV, the entertainment system is not turned on for the 70 mins flight from Gimpo to Jeju. The other only entertainment might be the inflight radio channels which we were not able to listen to as no earphones are being provided. We can only rely on the inflight magazine as the only source of ""entertainment"".

As this is a short flight, Korean Air does not serve any food onboard. As soon as the seat belt sign was switched off, the stewardess went around serving drinks. We were given a choice of tomato juice, orange juice, Pepsi or plain water.

The service onboard Korean Air is good for a 70 min domestic flight. We were warmly greeted at the door by the cabin crew. The service rendered by the cabin crew in Economy Class was good. Cabin crews were seen with smiles constantly hanging on their faces, despite being a full flight. They were also seen helping passengers from stowing their carry-ons in the overhead storage bin to offering help to parents whose child spill water on herself. They were constantly checking with the parents if they need help. The crew was also seen checking with a mother if she needs help in calming her crying baby. The cabin crew in Economy Class offered a second round of drink upon seeing our cups are empty.

Despite showing signs of ageing, the Korean Air A330-300 is sufficient for a short 70 mins domestic flight from Gimpo to Jeju. The seats are comfortable for a short-haul flight. Perhaps due to the short flight, the IFE was not turned on. The personal TV screen remained blank throughout the entire flight. The crew onboard offered good service despite being a short and full flight in the Economy Class.",October 2019,"March 4, 2020",4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0

All Major Western Airlines have offered a refund for their flights to Korea but ASIANA and KOREAN AIR. That goes to show you, money is more important than safety. Not even mentioning that one of their flight attendants was diagnosed with COV19. People right now are literally at the mercy of the American government ( or their respective govt.) to just outright ban flights to South Korea to get their money back. They have offered a bag of Lays and a Gatorade (30% of flight after cancellation) instead of relying on loyalty of the returning customers.

You are able to walk around and stretch your legs if you so choose. 

Our flight was long enough that we got two meals and two snacks. If you ask for more juice or alcohol with your meal there is not extra charge.

Safe and Comfortable flights Mumbai to Seattle,Mumbai,Seattle,International,"Travelled with family from Mumbai to USA Seattle and found the airline to be very comfortable, safe and passenger friendly. Seats had more leg space compared to many other airlines including Emirates in Economy Class; food served was Asian Vegetarian close to our Indian taste! We had booked the food in advance. 

The problem was seat selection that was not permitted in advance. During check-in at Mumbai airport, the lady allotted middle seats in the middle row saying that the flight was full. 

Not many Entertainment channels were there – none in Indian Language!

The flights were booked through Delta Airlines and Korean was the code share flight. They do not seem to give preference to code share partners!

They provide a fabric pouch (small bag) containing only toothbrush with paste and eye protecting cover for sleeping – in economy class.

“Unconventional “ 380 seat arrangements,Sydney,Seoul,International,"KAL’s 380 prestige class is 2,2,2 on upper deck.  The seats are not staggered.  In fact they are adjoined.  The separation panel between the seats is only the width of the arm rest and just less than 1/2 half meter ( or 18 inches) tall.  And because the 2 seats are parcelled It means the window seat passenger will have to ‘climb’ over the aisle seat person to go anywhere.  
Secondly, the screen is like economy class, on the back of the seat in front and is small.  I needed my glasses to read the subtitles.

Its a long trip, but KAL makes it a good experience. The trip over from USA was coach all the way. Of course Im prefer business class, but finances will not always allow. The only difference in the 2 classes is  business has a personal suite and coach is just a seat, also meals are a bit better in business. The service in coach is always great. The cabin crew are always professional, courteous, well mannered, and act happy to assist in any way. Seats are reasonably comfortable,and restrooms are always clean. Also, announcements  are timely from the flight deck, announcements are spoken in english, & korean, and often Japanese.. I guess it depends on what nationalities are on the aircraft on a particular flight. American Carriers could & should learn from KAL regarding cabin crew politeness , appearance, and professionalism.

I fly economically, so I look at creature conforts to make my travel comfortable. My plane was a Boeing 777-200. Very clean.. looking like new. Some things are not so obvious to the casual traveler, but the 777 has composite floor beams... less vibration, more confort. My seating in coach had plenty of legroom and the Shenyang- Seoul connection includes food service & beverage. 

Of course the plane gimmes are excellent, but what really stands out, there are a lot of flight attendents on Korean Air. They stay busy and they are friendly! 
My wife & I flew their Shenyang- Seoul- Seattle flights in early December... & enjoyed the same great service. 

Now, all is good with me & Korean Air, but the odd thing on my latest flight, Shenyang- Seoul, that really stood out, was that the water bottle left on the seat was personalized on a tag with my name & seat number! I'm thinking, this is a first for me. This reads remedial, but one has to consider Korean Air's excellence in customer service. 

There are 2 major airlines in Korea... Korean Air & Asiana. My Korean Air booking was a last moment purchase (the day before departure) at a very reasonable cost. 
I had to exit China because of my visa restrictions...the  last day for departure. I had an air ticket on a very good deal with Asiana, but increased ticket pricing for what air travel there is from China (the corona virus) was becoming prohibitedly expensive. S***! they bumped me! 
My future travel & monies will go to Korean Air.

Zero concern on passenger’s health safety,Washington DC,Manila,International,"On 1/28/2020, I cancelled my Korean Airline’s online flight reservations to the Philippines from 1/30-2/20/2020.   I also called the airline’s USA reservation desk to request if the cancellation fee on my reservation can be waived. I explained that because I have respiratory issues, my Primary Care Physician (PCP) advised that I do not travel to the Philippines during this time due to the poor air quality there caused by the Taal volcanic eruption on 1/12/2020 and still spewing ashes up until the day of my phone call. I also told their representative that I have a medical note from my PCP attesting to my condition. He said Korean Airlines do not have a policy concerning health conditions. I asked to speak to his manager but he refused to connect me and said that I will receive the same response. I then asked him to give me a contact information where I can directly write to, again he refused my request. As my last option, I wrote on the airline’s online customer support service, providing a copy of the medical note, and requested to have my situation forwarded to appropriate staff who can make a decision or who can make a compromise. An airline representative phoned me on 2/3/2020 rejecting my request because the airline does not have a policy concerning health conditions. I informed him that I will be writing a review about this incident. I find their non-policy unacceptable. Safety should be their #1 priority and should not put any of their passengers in harm’s way.",January 2020,"February 4, 2020",1.0,,,,,,,,
High standard airline but poorly organized lounge.,Seoul,Brisbane,International,"Had a few hours to fill in so went to the lounge expecting pleasant experience like several years ago in terminal 1 lounge. An apparent complex arrangement to book in but the experience was further exacerbated by finding up to 1/5 of the seating being taken up by selfish patrons who were using their opposite seat for their feet or bags. Food and beverages were excellent. Cleaning staff were of high standard. 

I observed a number ol people come in, look for seating, then leave in disgust. 

Koran Air needs to provide a service where suitably trained personnel ensure access to seating is equitable. . 

The whole experience was disappointing considering the high standard set by airline staff. 

The modern  electronic check in procedures before the flight were quite daunting especially when my passport was rejected. The sole, manual, check in lady was most helpful though.",January 2020,"February 1, 2020",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,5.0

One complaint should be the changing membership after 2022, because (as a morning calm member) I have been using Korean airlines for tens of years with a hope to be ""Life time Morning clam premium member"" in the future but can not achieve 500,000 mileage by year 2021..",,"January 31, 2020",5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,

Great flight with good service and food,Frankfurt,Seoul,International,"Flew with Korean for the thid time in november, I've flown with them 2 times from FRA and 1 time from CDG. All three flights have been superb with various differences. The Air France lounge they use from Paris is way better than Frankfurts but both the Boeing 777-300 and 747-8 have a much better seat layout than the Airbus 380. Service have been really good without being to intrusive and they ask you if you want to be waken up for the second meal wich is a nice touch. Despite not having serve to order catering as a concept I've gotten dinner served 2 times after waking up from sleep. The flightattendants are really efficient and get normal service finished in 1 hour so you can get sleeping fast if you're sleepy 10 out of 10. Incheon terminal 2 is a delight to fly from and transfer in but it's a review in it's self.
Have also flown with Korean Air on shorter inter Asia routes and domestic and have always been satisfied with those trips to.

They told me to sign up online after about two hours and now I get these spam emails that ignore when you unsubscribe from them. I also didn't get the changes I wanted because people don't understand how to transfer phone calls and work in a call center. The 777 we were on has legroom if you're a 5'2"" Korean but I'm 6'1"" and was cramped into the odd pitched seats that don't line up with the windows because they added a row to cram more people in.

Great Service/ Flight,Fort Lauderdale,Manila,International,Flew Delta from Ft Lauderdale to JFK to then fly on Korean Air to ICN then onto MNL. The service on board was great the flight attendants were very nice. The food was pretty good can’t even lie about that especially trying the Bibimbap for the first time was quite surprised they offered a traditional Korean dish. Flew on a 747-8 and 777-300 in economy the legroom was very impressive. I do recommend using Korean Air traveling to Asia. Their boarding process is very good especially starting from the back of the aircraft instead of the front. The airport at Incheon is very easy to navigate around especially with the boards they have and the informational robots. They’re beneficial to use if you’re a Delta Skymiles member like myself since you’ll be able to earn miles from Korean Air.

The longest journey,Sydney,London,International,"The main selling point for the epic Sydney to London journey with Korean Air is that you have to stop overnight at Incheon and savvy travellers know that you can get the airline to front up the overnight stay at the Grand Hyatt at the airport.  That enforced break, which delivered a decent night’s sleep and a very decent buffet breakfast, all courtesy of Korean Air, really helps to take the sting from flying between London and Oz on this route which really is the Long Way Round.  10 hours from Sydney to Seoul followed by 12.5 hours from Seoul to London really is a butt numbing experience in the cheap seats, so the chance to avail myself of the very fancy amenities at the hotel between flights was sorely needed.  As for the flights themselves, Korean Air really isn’t bad if you can just get past the really poor IFE experience. Given the incredibly diverse and generous offerings from other carriers on this route, the paucity of films and TV is quite shocking. Come on Korean Air, you must be able to do better than this if you want to attract more passengers to this route. No genuine first run movies and no box sets means you need to come with the tablet fully loaded (which I did). However, the flight safety video features BTS, the biggest boy band in the world, and it was a doozy. I didn’t mind watching it twice over at all!  Food and service are really pretty good, although the Koreans aren’t quite as warm and friendly as the FAs on Cathay Pacific.  As someone who needed a special meal I can honestly say that their non-lactose meal options were really very acceptable, which was a genuinely pleasant surprise. Between meals, if you want snacks they have Korean pot noodles available to enjoy in the galleys and they also hand out very tasty snacks during the seemingly interminable flights. The economy seat is pretty comfortable, with decent recline and leg room which means that even on the full flight on the second leg, I was comfortable. Would I fly this route again? Well, it wouldn’t be my first choice but overall I was very pleasantly surprised and Incheon is a great airport to transit through.",January 2020,"January 20, 2020",4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

The food options are plentiful, but try to get seats n the middle of the plane.  That will ensure you have a better chance of the entree you desire (I was last row and they ran out).  They do not do as much drink service runs on these flights as they do on US based airlines.  The crew is very polite, you just have to request things if you want anything additional.

Huge difference between check-in experience and in-flight service,Seoul,Shanghai,North Asia,"This was my first flight with Korean Air and I was looking forward to an experience flying with them.. I arrived at Incheon Airport after checking-in online hoping it would ease my dropping of luggage at the airport. I was told to use the kiosk at the airport before dropping off the luggage. But the kiosk instructed me to see a check-in counter for assistance.

This sparked a long wait as only a few counters out of all the counters at the airport handled such issues (joining the normal check-in line). The queue was terribly slow and I could have missed my flight if not for the kind assistance of a service supervisor I approach for help. She send me to a special counter for speedy assistance and luggage drop.

Left with a shocking experience I did not dare expect much of the rest of the flight. When I finally boarded the plane, i was warmly greeted by the cabin crew. My experience then on was simply excellent. The cabin crew was efficient, helpful and most attentive. I enjoyed the service on board Korean Air that day.

I do hope the airline does reflect on the problems faced by travellers at check-in who are not their loyalty members of higher tier. This will go a long way to making Korea Air, an airline of choice.",December 2019,"January 16, 2020",4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,5.0

Far better than possibly hoped for,Sydney,London,International,"I had read good things and we were blown away by how good they are. We flew ""Prestige"" which is an equivalent to Business Class. Our outbound flights to Sydney were brilliant. Planes were lovely and felt spotless and new.. Staff were faultless in presentation and service. The whole attitude of the team was brilliant. Have no fear about trusting them instead of one of the more famous (and much more expensive!) alternatives.
Seats were huge. Food was better than many restaurants that I have spent good money in and the choice of food style was great too. My wife loves Noodles and similar Korean style meals but I'm not as adventurous. We were both very impressed. 
Attention to detail was immense and the availability of a team member was superb.

I have listed the first leg home from Sydney stopping in Seoul particularly though because team member J I Shin was absolutely top quality with his service and conversation and willingness to help. 

We had a stop-over in Incheon (Seoul) on the way home and got a decent nights sleep in a lovely bed to break up the journey. Spend some time before you clear customs if you do leave the airport though because customs rules in South Korea are different for inbound and outbound goods. This means that it is possible to arrive legally with duty free purchased in Sydney but not to be able to join your flight the next day with the same items due to different onward restrictions. Basically don't buy alcohol or perfume in Sydney unless you put it in your hold luggage straight away. You WILL lose it in Incheon if you try to bring it with you in your carry-ons.
Spend a little time when you get to Incheon and establish if a private taxi is faster than the airline bus to your hotel (Ours was the Grand Hyatt). 

It all worked well but took a while and then we joined the masses checking in as well. A private taxi might well have avoided the crowds and been a bit faster too. I will know for next time and it's not a biggy.

The Grand Hyatt was beautiful. Again, everything was immaculate and plush and the people made me want to return for more time in Seoul when the chance arises.

We booked through SkyClub for a brilliant deal (better than when I was searching to do it all myself by approx £650). Again, they have been brilliant too.

This is the first time I have actually been a bit disappointed that the flight is over on a long haul down under.

The food is great.   I know it’s just a trial flight to Clark.  Hoping that it would be a permanent one.    I love the fact that it goes straight to Clark.   The reason I gave it a 3 stars because of weighting the hand carry and back pack together not weighing more than 12kg which really is nothing  in it,  otherwise I will give it a 5 stars.",January 2020,"January 7, 2020",3.0,,,,,,,,

Even though I sat in a row that received meals last, all three choices were available. One point to note, if you are allergic to seafood, order a special meal. All three choices for the second meal service included at least traces of seafood (such as fish sauce).

The best business class !!,San Francisco,Seoul,International,"First I did not enjoy their airport lounge that much. The chairs, tables, interior design and food choices were not that good. 
Also at the airport, they did not go out of their way to give you priority as business class passenger. 
Once I walked in the plane, I was very impressed. The flight attendant immediately offered to hang my coat and greeted me. She put my carryon away for me and showed me where my seat was. Later on flight manager came by to introduce herself and welcome me on board and to let me know to call her if I needed anything. 
The takeoff and landing was so smooth that I didn’t feel a thing which was the first time ever. Food, comfort, seat, service were amazing. Flight attendants were well trained and so polite.

Not a pleasant experience,Seoul,Singapore,Southeast Asia,"My family (Husband and 2 year old) and I have checked in prior to heading to Incheon Airport at South Korea. However there was some problem and we did not receive the sent boarding passes to the email. We tried printing at the machine but there was some error. No staff at the airport could help us. We went from counter A to counter G trying as the info counter asked us to go there. It was a long queue and the staff managing standing to direct before the queue asked us to queue at the help counter at counter G. It was 45 mins before our flight already and there was a really long queue and moving slowly. 15 mins after the queue, it moved a bit. Seeing that it’s only 30 mins before our flight and we have not passed immigration, my husband went to check with the staff standing at the queue. He said he could not help and stood there for a good 10 mins after later told us that there is a family counter at Counter F, said we can go there. It was already like 20 mins to our flight. We had some problems with our luggage. We have three people with one luggage cause traveling with a small one and easier for us to take one luggage and it was 26kg and overweight by 3kg. We had to open to remove to make it 23kg as they only accept 23kg for one if not it will be overweight. I get that every airline have different policy but it’s not family friendly at all. In was luckily there was a family queue for those with little one at the immigration. We made a mad dash to the gate and it was already boarding when we reached there. 

At the airline back, there was one lunch and one snack, I didn’t feel full during lunch so I took a pizza and banana for the snack. I asked the stewardess why she didn’t serve my husband, but she said I already took two (one banana and pizza) and is each for one person. Shouldn’t there be spares if passengers would like an additional. In the end I had to change the banana for the pizza. I understand that maybe there is not enough. When there were extras she didn’t come back and serve me but only the Korean passengers sitting in front and side, she just skipped pass me. I do feel that service level can be improved. Maybe what she can do is let me know that if there are extras then I can have it. 

Overall just didn’t have a pleasant experience from the counter check in till the flight. And I didn’t find the seat comfortable too, no back and head support, it was at a weird angle. The only positive part is there is adequate leg space. Not too sure if I will take this airline again.",December 2019,"December 31, 2019",2.0,,,,,,,,

I did ask for a drink two more times but didn't want to ask for more than that as people around me were getting annoyed.

First Grade Airline,Kuala Lumpur,Seoul,North Asia,"By first grade airline I mean not the budget pay for each item you take. KAL as it was fondly known in days of old, is a national carrier. The flight we took was a B747-8 wide bodied when airlines typically go for A330 or B777. 

As any first graders, they offer comfy seats, screen with a fair selection of titles. If you are used to the likes of EK,EY and QR the KAL service us a notch below. You dont get hot towels and frequent rounds of attendants asking if you would like anything. But you get an amenity kit (slippers etc) and bigger blankets. Attendants are polite. 

Check in experience is good although for some reason we encountered, online check in was not possible as they want to verify the credit card used to cover tickets for all others in the family. Now that is a negative point as we don’t get to choose the seats to ensure the family sit together.",December 2019,"December 22, 2019",4.0,,,,,,,,

Pleasant Suprise,Phnom Penh,New York City,International,"I have just returned from a quick trip to the US traveling with Korean Air. 
I used 2 flight each way and both were very full and I was concerned about the level of service. 
It was good!
Due to the business I was doing in the US I checked directly with Korean Air about my seating. They allocated a seat all the way on the forward journey. This helped as usually you cannot pre request seats. If anything this was a big issue for me and others I am sure. 
The check in was efficient and smooth even with my excess baggage. Loading was not done by row and due to the numbers the lines were long. 
On board I was greeted by smiling staff. 
The staff in Economy were pleasant all during the flight and the meal delivered with all choices available. It was tasty and hot. Wine was offered and refilled several times. I slept along with most other passengers. Water was offered during both flights. Arrival was easy in Seoul it was early but most shots and cafes were open. The airport is very big and lots of walking required. 
The next flight was much of the same with the long lines. The food service still had all the choices, snacks were provided (noodles) hot water on request for that cup of tea that I enjoy using my own tea bag. 
Several meals later our arrival in NYC  at JFK was a bit slow but not excessively so. What was slow was the baggage as the 
A380 carries lots of people who all had at least 2 bags so be prepared to wait. 
The return flights were much the same although we did sit on the tarmac for some time waiting for departure this was mostly made up during the flight. 
Therefore there was not a terrible rush on arrival to make the connection. 
Seating in the middle rows is not what I would usually accept but I felt on this flight there was slightly more room in the middle aisle seat. It was quite comfortable and I would request again as a choice. 
Thank you Korean Air for a comfortable flight, pleasant staff, acceptable food and not to bad entertainment provided.

Boarding was orderly and smooth, but for some reason the flight was delayed, waiting for late passengers, leading to late departure and causing me to miss my connecting flight from Seoul (not at all nice!). The plane (A380) was spacious and comfortable, with good space and legroom, and the staff kept the plane meticulously clean throughout the long flight.  Food was surprisingly good (including an excellent meal of beef and potatoes).  Entertainment selections could have been more varied and extensive, but were OK.

But this September, 2019 I was surprised  their website has improved a lot.  I got problem though with checking in  24 hours before the departure, but it was easily resolved because of accommodating and helpful personnels who patiently answered my phone inquiries .  The crew were also accommodating and attentive to the needs of the passengers.  
I seldom eat in the plane but this time it was different.  I was able to eat and finish my food ((perhaps, I could feel the hunger because the food is light).  I tried the Bibimbap and hoarded the Korean paste that went with it, the Gochujang.  I saw on their brochures that the price was expensive but the airline did gave 1 20 gm tube per serving.

Flying With Korean Air for the First Time,Manila,Atlanta,International,"Long flights can be really exhausting but finding the right airline will make it easier and convenient. Last November one, I booked my flight going to the US with Korean Air. I had three flights in total and the itinerary is Manila to Incheon,Incheon to 
Atlanta, and Atlanta to West Palm Beach (via Delta Airlines). It is my first time flying with Korean Air and I've always wanted to try it because I wasn't able to fly with it when I visited Korea two years back. Upon entering, the blue green interiors will welcome you and give you a cozy feeling. I am at the economy class and for me, it has enough leg room for long haul flights. My flight from Manila to Incheon was 3 hours and I did not expect it to be very fast since other airlines take 4 hours to reach. The flight was smooth and we had good food as well. We arrived at around 3 in the morning and it was a good timing to have a few hours of sleep before our next long flight. Our 2nd flight to Atlanta left at almost 10 in the morning. It was a 13 hour flight. I enjoyed the good selection of movies and music. I enjoyed the good food again and had a comfortable sleep. I also would like to commend how superb the flight attendants are. They are very attentive to our needs and they maintain very good grooming throughout the flight. It was the longest flight I had so far and I'm happy that I flew with Korean Air. The most important thing is that we didn't have delays. We arrived to the US as planned and I don't really feel exhausted as I expected that I would be. For my Atlanta to West Palm Beach, we booked via Korean Air but it was actually operated by Delta. It was also a hassle free flight and we arrived as planned safe and sound. I highly recommend Korean Air for short or long haul flight.

I had a little over a one hour layover on one leg of the trip and a three hour layover on the other leg and despite my worries (especially on the one hour+ layover) everything went smoothly.  My bag even made it both times despite Delta taking over the flight back to Seattle.  I attribute the lack of problems due to Korean Air’s timeliness.  In fact all flights arrived ahead of schedule.  Also, Incheon Airport is probably the best airport I’ve ever experienced so that helped as well.  Incheon is run like a well oiled machine with amenities similar to a high class shopping mall.  Service on Korean Air flights is about as good as you’ll find on any airline.  The food was excellent.  Entertainment was only average due to a smaller selection of movies compared to other airlines but it’s still sufficient. Flight attendants clean and replenish the bathrooms on a regular schedule as well.  I’ve never seen that on other airlines that fly internationally.

Other than that, the flight attendants were friendly & they served you meals quite a few times during a long flight.",November 2019,"December 9, 2019",3.0,,,,,,,,

Korean Air Economy,Las Vegas,Manila,International,"Although the flight and service was good, the seat will be assigned to you 24 hours before the flight.

Suitable arrangements for families with small children,Kuala Lumpur,Osaka,North Asia,"We flew from KL to Kansai via Incheon - a transit of approximately two hours for us to stretch our legs and not too taxing on the children. The flight was very good and the children received special attention in the form of gifts and special headphones. The legroom on the airplane was generous and not too cramped. However, the special food was a bit generic for my taste. I am grateful that our family was given priority boarding as it is very helpful, and we had a lot of things to bring into the cabin.

The return trip was a bit hectic and frantic as we only have about 1 hour to switch planes, and the starting flight from Kansai was delayed! Thankfully, the ground staff was on standby to direct us through the maze of Incheon terminal and we made it to the connecting flight with the echoes of the final call.

"Great fight on the 787 from YVR to Seoul,  the A380 from Seoul to BKK was older",Vancouver,Bangkok,International,"The 787 was great, lots of leg room in economy, I had a window seat on the right side of the plane and there is lots of elbow room there which is nice for sleeping.  The meals were good, but the snacks between meals were limited.  I did see people getting hot noodles for snacks, but when I asked they said no. Might have been a language barrier thing.
Seoul airport was fine, had a quick layover.  It was a long walk between gates for my connection, so if your on a short layover keep that in mind.
The A380 had an older entertainment system and seats, but it was still ok.  Not as much room as on the 787, but it was a shorter flight so it was ok.",December 2019,"December 9, 2019",5.0,,,,,,,,
Australasia to Europe on Korean Air,Auckland,London,International,"Because KE flights from NZ/Australia to Europe involve a long layover in Seoul, KE treats you to an all-expenses paid stopover! 
Once you have bought you ticket (and I believe this offer only applies to return tickets), just call the airline and they will send email your STPC (STopover Paid by Carrier) confirmation to you.
They don't say anything about this on the website, and when I called them they wouldn't confirm whether they'd give us the STPC or not - you have to buy your ticket first.
When you arrive at the airport go to the STPC desk and they will bus you to your hotel (we stayed in the Grand Hyatt).
The hotel was lovely but close to the airport rather than in Seoul itself – my neighbours have taken this flight several times and they don't bother with the KE-supplied accommodation, they catch the fast train into central Seoul and pay for their own hotel (hotels in downtown Seoul are not expensive).
We arrived at the hotel at around 10pm, had a nice long sleep followed by a fabulous breakfast and then a swim in the hotel pool (make sure you bring a bathing cap - they won't let you in without one).
At 10.30am we headed back to the airport for our flight to London which arrived 5pm, just in time for dinner and another good sleep. We suffered no jet-lag whatsoever - amazing!
The trip back however has a short layover - our flight from Rome had just one hour, which was perfect and meant our entire travel time to Auckland was just under 24 hours.
Of course if you are travelling in the opposite direction, you will have your stopover on the way home.
KE is a great airline with nice staff but only OK food. The wine pour was pretty stingy (but they delivered more drinks happily and promptly when asked) and excellent seat room - the 787-9 we flew in had 271 seats, Air New Zealand crams 302 seats into the same plane.
I was quite annoyed that they made us pull the window shades down when it was light outside - but they are not the only airline that does this.
The range of entertainment wasn't great either, and although we flew up in September and back in October, most of the movies hadn't changed.
Don't forget to check your luggage all the way through to your final destination so that you don't have to lug extra baggage around on your stopover.
The flight was very well priced too (NZ$1600 or 945 Euro return) and they allow open-jaw flights - we flew into Heathrow and out of Rome.
This is by far the best way to travel from 'down under' to Europe.",September 2019,"December 9, 2019",5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0

The plane had lay flat seats set up so whether you were window or aisle you had a private entrance to your seat, so no disturbing the person next to you,  with the privacy divider up you were completely separated from everyone.

Food: Unfortunately most of these carriers do not know what to serve in the air. Most of the food combinations served is extremely unhealthy,  and can cause health issues in mid air. There is a dire need for the airline industry to research into combining food and making standards to safeguard the health of air travelers. 

For Example we requested Hindu meals and we were serves chick peas which is known to cause gas.

Entertainment options are limited. Movie selection are not what you expect from a renowned airline that is on an A-380 , and flying 14 hours. Service wise, they are fast with the call button .

Ironic that flight 081 from Seoul to NY served noodles when requested. They provide amenities of slippers and dental kits.Sorry but no pouches. Anyway it was a smooth flight. Food was just ok , nothing fancy compared with the Emirates. But on the flight to Manila they serve ice cream , that is flight 623. They have extensive duty free options , they even have a display at the rear end of the plane. On a hind sight , the flight attendants belonging to Sky Team are purely service oriented, and refuse having their photos taken with them . My initial flight from Manila to Seoul , I was flatly refused even when deplaning and it was just saying thank you and goodbye. I consider it racist and maybe I was physically not amusing for her.

Smooth as silk---sort of.,Seattle,Manila,International,"A very pleasant trip. The flight attendants were most gracious and accommodating. Even though they did not speak English, they found a delightful way to communicate with us. They were very solicitous of a couple of old and disabled people. Our problem started when we were getting ready to board in Seattle. They took our walkers away from us when we boarded, assuring us they would be waiting for us whenwe stopped over in Seoul. They did not have our walkers waiting for us. what a  nightmare!  We were put in a couple of wheelchairs with pushers who did not speak English.  My husband had to go to the bathroom, and the man took off with him, not knowing what a bathroom was. Apparently, they were going all over the  place, but by the time the male got to the bathroom, my husband had an accident. In the meantime, the female pusher left me under a stairwell, and just walked off. Finally, the men returned. Without the female pusher, I had to painfully push my own wheelchair all the way to where we had to wait for our connecting flight...and still no sign of our walkers. Again, my husband had trouble getting to a bathroom, and without my walker, I had to hobble to get our food. The flight attendants were angels, but the stopover was a nightmare.

Terrible diabetic meal,Toronto,Seoul,International,"I requested to have diabetic meal for this trip, my first and last time.  I was shocked to see that they served white rice, potatoes and white bread.  Also they had cantaloupe and honeydew melon as dessert.  That was from Toronto Airport with a note on the tray that the calories have been calculated for the meal.  They miss the point of what a diabetic meal should be.  Surprisingly Korean Air from Singapore to Incheon flight served brown rice, brown bread along with meal, and a special snack for diabetes which was a sandwich on brown bread.  On the flight from Incheon to Toronto we got a note on the tray that the meal was planned with a medical team from some university in Korea.  That brought my expectations high until I opened the meal, again white rice and potatoes...  Watermelon and Korean pear for dessert.  To make it worse, really really bland.  Even kidney failure patients eat food with more taste.  If I didn't mind white rice and bread as part of my meal I would have just opted for their regular ones which at least have flavour!  I used to like this airline, would even pay more to fly with them but the last trip was a let down with the meals, and also the male older flight attendant was unpleasant.

Excellent!,Singapore,Honolulu,International,"Flew SIN-ICN-HNL, and back on Korean Air (our first time), Prestige Class, and Hubby and I were thoroughly impressed. 

Pros
• we had both Prestige Sleeper and Prestige Suites and these beds are best in its class. No stifling footwell to slot our legs into like so many other Business seats! Beds are both 180 degrees flat. Highly recommend the upper deck of the 747 which is super quiet and with so few passengers, service is more personal
• excellent inflight service and healthy, generously portioned meals
• fares are cheaper than the Japanese airlines that we usually fly with
• transiting through Incheon, we got to try a free Incheon Transit Tour which was a great way to break up our journey
• in Honolulu, due to the congestion of their lounge, we were given US$20 vouchers each to spend at Starbucks or any other food vendor. Which suited us perfectly as we loaded up on our favourite KIND bars

Cons
• Korean Air Lounges are really sub par. Surprisingly, their flagship lounges in Incheon is also uninspired. No fresh fruit offered.
• cabins can be on the warm side (exception ICN-SIN which was perfect!)
• our seat would have been perfect is the airline provided mattress pads and a normal sized pillow

Hostess gave me permission to ""climb over him!"" One caveat. Don't sit in the front row of a section b/c there's no room for stashing things. Very awkward. That was one flight.

Gets the important things right,San Francisco,Hanoi,International,"We recently flew in Korean Air from SFO to Hanoi, with a short layover in Seoul (ICN). Sitting in the economy section for a 10+ hour flight is never fun, but this trip was reasonably tolerable for the following reasons:
- A couple of extra inches of legroom. KA seat pitch is typically 34 inches, and those extra inches make a big difference in terms of comfort.
- Clean, modern, well maintained aircraft. Aisles, seat areas, and especially bathrooms were very tidy.
- Bilingual service was courteous and efficient.
- Efficient and timely boarding and unboarding process reduced overall travel time and hassle.

On the flip side, meals were pretty dismal and entertainment options were less extensive than typical on international flights.

Very reasonable round trip fare of $730. One minor gripe is you can't see a seat map after buying tickets without joining KA frequent flyer program.

Fortunately we could use a new card and get exactly the same booking (after 20 minutes of paperwork), and KA did refund the exact amount previously paid. One caution, wine pour is about 2 ounces.

Korean Airlines 1st and 2nd times a charm,Seoul,San Francisco,International,"Well the 2nd time I have given ANYTHING a top rating. I’m assuming “10” was a top rating.

 Start off by saying I have special dietary needs. This was no problem for the staff onboard the flight. I say staff because I’m not sure if stewardess is PC. 

2nd. The way one of the staff members handled a A-hole on the flight politely waiting until he finished his A-holeness and continued to help him quietly and politely. Several points for that alone. 

3rd. Consistency. I flew direct flight last year 2018 direct flight into South Korea round trip. I received the same care and questions truly seeming to be concerned with my comfort. 

I travel internationally mostly once but, sometimes twice in a year. Because of the cost I want good or if I’m lucky great customer service. When I receive the kind of attention and concern I received I have to say something.

Be careful of Service Center,Tokyo,Honolulu,International,We were supposed to fly out of Tokyo on Korean Air the night Typoon Hagibis hit.  Our flight was delayed until 12:20 pm the following day.  Called the service center to confirm the time that morning - called twice (called Japan service center and America’s service center) - both agents told me our flight was for 9:20 pm not 12:20 and I should get email confirmation.  It never came so I called again after 12:20 and we were told we missed our flight. Korean Air is trying to get us another flight out but everything is booked.  They are not paying for any of our expenses for the extra nights we are here.  Any advice on what are rights are?

Flying Korean Air Economy Third Party,San Francisco,Tokyo,International,"Fellow travelers, hope this helps. Most fares purchased to fly with Korean Air through a third party, whether it is domestic or international, will be subject to the lowest privileges. The main two being, not able to reserve seats until check in and not having the ability to upgrade to another class (ie. Economy Plus, Business...). However, after check in, the staff are very friendly and helpful.

"Allergies - staff said ""pick the allergens out of the meal or don't eat anything""",London,Tokyo,International,"This seems to be one of the least competent arilines available, except for one member of staff.

We infrmed them of my partner's mutiple serious allergies 2 weeks before flying. At the checkin, we chacked there was a special meal. There was, but it was prepared to only leave out one allergen.

We dealt with multiple members of staff consuming a lot of our, and their time, trying to fix the situation. They seemed to have no knowledge of the contents of meals, nor the potential seriousness of allergies.

Useful suggestions from the staff included, ""why not just pick out the allergens from the meal"", ""Well you should have prepared your own meal before you came on our flight"" and you could always just not anything"", ""We might be able to give you rice porrige with nothing in it"". Bizarrely, we found out that the standrd meal was in fact safe.

There were various other levels of inepttude. until one manager personally took responsibility and did manage to find the details.

Overall this marred the flight by leaving myselef and my partner higly stressed.

The Korean Air menu was very interesting as it consisted of Korean foods. Not bad, but certainly different than what we are used to.

"Very nice experience, but IFE needs serious work.",New Delhi,San Francisco,International,"Lovely flights from DEL to SFO (transit in ICN)! Totally worth the money.

Pros:
* Generous kneespace
* Good food.
* Good service.
* Free slippers.
* Decent hours (although slightly long layover).

Cons:
* No WiFi (seriously; it's 2019...)
* TV show selection is horrible.

I flew 2 legs, 1 intra Asia (DEL to ICN) and 1 trans-pacific (ICN to SFO). KE was really *really* nice. The only reason I took off a star is for IFE (both the TV selection and WiFi). Otherwise, they are on par with SQ and EK, my favorite. I think I like them better than Hainan (HU).

First, their boarding is superhuman. Seriously. The 777 was packed (not a single seat opened), and everyone boarded in 30 minutes. I don't know how they did it... I unfortunately got the SSSS label, so I went through additional check, but still it's pretty fast.

The legroom was quite generous, especially compared to China Eastern 777. The bulkhead seats was simply marvelous. I got stuck in middle seat for the trans-pacific (yes, I did consider crying at the counter for a change, but they showed me seatmap, and nothing is opened), but I was not that cramped, which is very good. I was able to nap (on and off) for both flights (can't say the same thing about MU...).

Oh, they give everyone free slippers. It's simply <3.

The service was really nice. All FA were very friendly. I don't know how they did this, but I told 1 FA that I don't speak Korean (I am from Vietnam, so I look Korean), and *everyone* knows. Plus, when you have bags to put up (for takeoff and landing), the FAs offered (and did) to put it for you, not ""you need to put this up."" It was lovely. They gave only 1 hot towel service for the 2 legs (the breakfast of trans-pacific), but that beats most airlines except SQ and EK (don't get me started on MU...).

The food was also lovely, especially for economy. I got a bibimbap, a beef stew, and a congee. All were excellent. Very flavorful. The beef was cooked till very tender. All sauces are nicely flavored. They also had wine, but I traveled with my mother-in-law, so water and coffee only. They also have ramen cup for snack, but I did not peruse.

The toilet was clean the entire 2 flights, and lotion was offered.

And with that, let's turn to the sorry situation of their IFE. The movie selection is OK OK (unfortunately, I just did SFO -> DEL a day before, so I already caught up on latest movies), but the TV shows were weird. They had 2 eps for each of Friend, How I Met Your Mother, and Big Bang Theory. Like, why? I would rather 6 eps of any than 2 eps of each. More to the point, why can't they have a full season of *anything*?

And, to add insult ot injury, no WiFi. I kid you not, not even on B777 for transpacific. I mean, I was able to sleep, so it's not too horrible. But still.

The trip cost was reasonable, $800/per RT, which is decent for US to India. The layover is slight long, but ICN has transit hotel, which was *lovely*. Oh, and they take off and arrive at very reasonable hours. They took off from DEL at 7:40PM and arrived in SFO at 11:30AM, which are very nice. Most airlines in DEL like to take off at like midnight...

Overally, extremely satisfied customer. I agree with a random passenger: KE is (kind of) the best. Well, if they fix their IFE. Seriously.",September 2019,"September 17, 2019",4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0

Good Service Overall,Seoul,Auckland,International,"Flew Auckland to Amsterdam return with Korean Air due to a very good business class fare. My main motivation was to get a lie-flat bed. The flights from Auckland to Seoul and Seoul to Auckland on the 787-9 were excellent; the seat converted at the push of a button to a comfortable flat bed with plenty of room to stretch out. However you do need to keep your head down if you have a window seat as it's a bit low, I managed to hit my head twice. Also the entry to the window seats is quite narrow. I suggest you book an aisle seat.
The flight from Seoul to Amsterdam was unfortunately a co-share provided by KLM and the bed was not as comfortable and narrow where your feet go. But the worst was probably the flight from Amsterdam to Seoul on the 777-200 as your feet dangled (no ottoman or shelf), the bed was quite uncomfortable and there was absolutely zero storage space.

The reason I would fly them again is because of the cabin attendant service.

Being vegan, I was able to pre-order my vegan meal from the airline which I was happy about. The food was ok, i'll give it a 6. I think Korean air is quite flexible in terms of choosing a seat in advance as well because I was told I could book my seat once my booking has been paid for. Unlike some airlines which I've flown with in the past.

Korean Airline Has the best crew and service and clean planes in the industry.,Kuala Lumpur,Seoul,North Asia,"Super professional crew members and ground staff. Korean airlines in the 90’s were rated the worst airliner, however, the have turned it around and easily takes the first prize when it comes to service, cleanliness, aircraft, and super clean, intelligent and caring Flight attendants. 

This is my take, and not sure why airliners like Singapore, Emirates, and others think they come even a mile  close to Korean Airlines. 

Hats off to Korean Airlines and their crew and hats off to the Korean nation for working hard to get where it is.

The Best Choice for Most Trips Between North America and Asia,Vancouver,Seoul,International,"We have flown on Korean Air several times between Cambodia and Vancouver or Toronto.Often we chose Korean because they have the best rate.

On our flight from YVR to ICN on 01 Sept, someone had a serious medical emergency just as meal service was beginning.

In the end a medical professional came forward and the person was cleared to go back to their seat. 
Our baggage has never been lost and you can set your clock by the flight departure. 
The food is actually quite good for airplane food, with three choices. If you choose Korean fare, the FA will tell you how to eat it if you are unfamiliar. There are other extras including sleep masks and ear plugs if your seat is too near the galley, and packets for children.
I would say they are excellent, but the level of English is not always good (but it is not English Airways is it?) Albeit, I rank them very high and give my recommendation.",September 2019,"September 3, 2019",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0
Good Airline,London,Seoul,International,"Well i've used British Airways and Asiana to fly to korea so this time i wanted to try Korean Air which uses the A380 . Once aboard you are given the standard blanket slippers and a pair of headphones and a bottle of water. 
I always sit on the isle seats as im 193 cm tall (6 Foot 3 inches) and i still found enough room where my knees were not pressing in to the back of the seat in front of me. The seats recline quite well as i found out as soon as the person in front of me sat down and we took off she reclined her seat all the way back and i found my TV monitor almost in my face which forced me to recline my seat just so i could see the monitor. ( troubles of being tall ) if i was shorter it wouldn't have been an issue.
Overall great flight , Flight Attendants always looking the greatest and very pretty, also very helpful to your needs. 

The only con i would say and it may not really be a con for some people but i am really sensitive to smells like perfume and im sure it was one of the attendants but every time she would walk by her perfume or body spray was so over powering it made me feel Queasy but like i said it wont be an issue for other people.",August 2019,"August 31, 2019",5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0

Decent economy class product,Jakarta,Seoul,North Asia,"This was my first time flying on Korean air. I flew overnight to Seoul from Jakarta and the return leg in the day time a few days later. Korean air operates a Boeing 777-300 on this route and economy seats are laid out in a 3, 3, 3 configuration - not ideal for couples although fine for the likes of me, traveling on my own.

My overall experience was positive. The economy seats were comfortable and came with loads of legroom and the service on both flights was very friendly. Food was decent (I had the Korean option on both legs) and, on the outbound, overnight leg, economy class passengers were given a basic amenity kit; unusual in economy class. The toilets were clean throughout the flight and disposable toothbrushes were available - another nice touch.

Just a couple of minor gripes; the wine portions were almost laughably small; no more than a mouthful - I know this can be hit and miss but it seemed to be policy as all flight attendants were serving the same portions. From a personal perspective, the inflight entertainment options were extremely limited. Admittedly though, i'm not from Korea or Indonesia so it's understandable that entertainment wouldn't be aimed at me. The inflight entertainment system and flight maps though were excellent.

Pretty good though, overall, and would definitely fly with Korean Air again.",August 2019,"August 22, 2019",4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

I'm ready not happy  with this.  Korean air as a customer service plan on their site which clearly states that if any flight cancellation or delays,  they will help pay for overnight stay and any delays. I emailed them about this, their reply was,  since they reschedule before my travel date,  no compensation and that they can change their reschedule whenever they need to.

Business Class Korean Aire,Los Angeles,Seoul,International,"I have flown Korean Air business class many times between Los Angeles and SE Asia, mostly because it is tied in with Delta with which I am a frequent flier.

The flights usually run exactly on time, the food is usually excellent and abundant (although I've noticed it depends on the flight-- in my experience flights returning to the US have better prepared food than those headed to Asia, but this could just be a coincidence).

Regarding service inflight, they only had one person serving both the meals and drinks, which was quite inefficient and slow.  Also, if you are a non-pork eater and forgotten to order a special meal in advance, choices in meals are slim pickings.  Lastly, while it was very nice of them to greet every passenger coming on the plane, just because a person looks of a certain origin (in my case, of Indian descent) does not mean that they want to or can relate to the greeting of ""namaste"".

Just ok,Washington DC,Denpasar,International,"My husband and I took this flight for a dive trip in Indonesia.  We flew from IAD to Seoul, 14 hrs, then Seoul to Denpasar, Bali 6-1/2 hrs.  We chose business class, because we could lay flat.  We have flown business class 2 other times, once on Delta, and once on KLM.  The first flight going we suffered from the tendency of the pilot to be over zealous with the seatbelt sign with turbulence.  Honestly, sometimes they were nearly non existent but we were still not allowed to go to the bathroom.  When we hit smooth air, he’d forget to turn it off.  There also seemed to be a language barrier, as the stewardesses English was not very good and often did not understand us, nor we them.  The food was ok, nothing great.  The plane temperature was on the warm side, and no air vents.  
The return trip had slightly better food, and the whole seatbelt/turbulence thing wasn’t an issue, but the stewardesses seemed off their game for second meal service.  They told another gal in our group that she couldn’t have the chicken dish, because they were out, and made her pick a Korean dish, yet everyone around her was served chicken, including her husband, me, and my husband.  When they brought the dessert cart, I asked for chocolate ice cream and they told me I couldn’t have it because they were out, yet the gal servicing my husband gave him chocolate and had 10 more on her cart, and my friends across the aisle got chocolate.  The movie selection is meh.  The seats are comfortable, and recline completely.  They don’t come by very often with water, and when they do, id say the glasses are about 3-4 ozs.  I would fly them again to get the Delta miles, but I’d rather be on KLM or Delta.  And the whole point of business class is being able to lie flat, and have enough space to to get some work done, and KA does the job.  All in all, kinda lack luster.  But I was able to work for about 8 hours on the return, and got about 6-7 hours of sleep.  And that makes a huge difference.",August 2019,"August 11, 2019",3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,,,

TV Screen's a long way away.,Paris,Seoul,International,"Prestige (Business) Class  is on the top deck of the A380. Seating is what they call the Sleeper Seat, a push button, 180-degree, full-flat seat. On this plane, that’s 21 inches of width & 74 inches of space. There was a mechanical problem with mine and I had to change seats. The Sleeper Seat is still much better than the claustrophobic ‘Suite’. TV Screen's a long way away though.
Service and food was first-class although there was no drinks service, as per the menu, and we had to ask for an aperitif. Truly a first-world problem eh?
The great under-appreciated benefit of Business Class is the use of Lounges at the airport. Seoul has an excellent facility that offers showers. If you are on a very long haul, eg. Paris to Sydney, a freshen-up makes a great difference. Carry a change of clothing.

On some flights was really good food, on our way back (last hop from Incheon to Prague) it was a bit worse for us as Europeans (all food I picked was eigher too much spicy, or did not like it), but still you could order extra noodles for free, if some of the food did not suit you. The crew were very friendly, tried to help and the flight was relatively quiet.

Korean Air flights; San Francisco (SFO) - Seoul (ICN) - Hongkong - Taipei (Taoyuan),San Francisco,Seoul,International,"In the past two years, I have travelled 5 trips through Korean Air between San Francisco, Seoul, and Hongkong.

The planes interiors look nice, clean, and new; plenty of leg rooms; excellent movie choices; good food; helpful and friendly flight attendants. I have joined their Skypass frequent flyer membership to accumulate mileages.

My little disappointment would be the check-in at Incheon airport. The Korean Air check-in counters are at Terminal 2. They occupy probably more than half of all aisles at Terminal 2 (this is their main hub), but they only allow 1 aisle for economy class check-in. Obviously this caused a long line. Be prepare to allow more than 1/2 hours for check-in. Checking-in at Incheon airport always took the longest time among all other airports that I mention above.  I don’t quite understand why they would not allow other aisles to be open for economy check-in. I noticed that there were crews/workers at counters on other aisles but they were pretty much idle, supposedly waiting for business/first class travelers.

Delighted.,Auckland,Istanbul,International,"As older and more discerning travellers we seek out business class for long haul flights. The flight is as important as a good bed....
Flying to Istanbul via Dubai or Doha is too long a segment so Auckland/Seoul/Istanbul gives 2 similar segments. Korean Air offered a first class stopover in Seoul to break this even more. What a surprise. Korean Air is first class. Attentive but not too much so. A menu that would rival most restaurants and clean. Very clean. 
Korean have good airport lounges and an exemplary baggage priority system. The planes were modern and the lie flat seats were perfect. Slightly lean on movie selections but more than enough to entertain.",June 2019,"July 13, 2019",5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Enjoyable,Brisbane,Seoul,International,"Flight from Brisbane leaves at 8.25am four times a week.

Checkin was quick and found lounge which was the Plaza Premium lounge. That was average at best.

Boarding was quick and easy and staff were friendly and attentive. They do however speak in whispers so I had a lot of “I beg your pardon “.

I Did like the forward and under plane camera made take off and touch down interesting.

Plenty of space and the seat was comfortable.
After take off was asked to submit food orders. I had beef tenderloin and for later the fish. Beef was ok but the fish was exceptional. Served with wine if desired.

I used my iPad for entertainment and kept the cameras on the large screen.

After 2 hours they darkened the plane something I didn’t expect as it was a daytime flight.

My first business class experience as a paying prebooked passenger. It was nice to know that I could use the lounge, it was nice to get an increased level of service but of course that comes at a cost.

Whilst my seat was comfortable it will be interesting to see what it’s like as a flat bed on the next leg.

Nothing Special - we won't use Korean air again,Sydney,Vienna,International,"We booked our flights through a travel agent and for whatever reason which we never got to the bottom of seating had not been allocated for any of the legs, including return flights Heathrow to Sydney via Seoul. Ticketing info indicated we would be able to log into the Korean Air website 48hrs prior to departure to select seats but even after repeated attempts before departure for both the outward and return flights we could not access the website or the Airline by phone . We were advised at Sydney that the website was ""down"". This led to confusion and seating offers for my wife and I to travel in seperate seats. It was sorted eventually but only after a lengthy and sometimes heated discussion, with a similar incident at Seoul on the return leg home. The flight included an overnight stopover in Seoul. Transfers from Incheon to Seoul and back again the following morning were very efficient, only taking about 45min. The hotel was comfortable. The Sydney Seoul flight was by Airbus 380 and I thought the seats were quite uncomfortable - it was as if all the comfort padding was worn out - something I've never noticed before. Food was acceptable Korean based with no western option. My wife opted for a vegetarian meal which was very poor. Alcohol based rinks were readily available at mealtime but it was difficult to secure a steward for a drink in between meal times. The second leg, Seoul to Vienna was by Boeing 777 and I thought the seats were far better but similar comments apply as above regarding food and the availability of drinks.

The comfort of seats on each leg was alright however this was not a Cathay Pacific flight and that is clearly borne out in the price you pay.

Korean Air - best so far,Brisbane,London,International,"When looking for a flight to spend Xmas in the UK I came across Korean Airlines. Not having flown with them before, I looked up reviews and all seemed good. Due to the long stopover in South Korea - Incheon airport as part of the price the airline paid for you to stay overnight in one of their hotels. We were very fortunate and got the 5* Intercontinental. We were also given food vouchers for an evening meal and breakfast the following morning before being picked up and taken back to the airport. The food was amazing as was the hotel & we had a much needed good night's sleep. The airline itself had good in-flight entertainment and the food was the best I've had on a flight. On the return leg there is no overnight accommodation as its only a 6 hour stop at the airport. Incheon airport was lovely, very clean & decorated beautifully for the festive season. There is a Nap Zone with beds so you can set your alarm & have a sleep. Also there are free showers (& towels). All this made a long flight very bearable.

Our son was given not only the attention he needs during the flight but also plenty of kiddy bags from the airline to keep them occupied. It also helps the fact that my son love Porroro the cartoon character from Korea and that’s exactly what they were handing out to the kids. We also weren’t so hungry when we boarded the plane so we totally missed out on 2 meals and they were kind enough to really check up on us if we are still hungry or if we want something.

Do No Fly Korean Air,New York City,Cebu Island,International,"Just wanted to post this so that would happen to me does not happen to anyone else. My wife booked a flight on Korean Airlines to go home and visit family. Unfortunately, she was rushed to the emergency room and had emergency surgery. The doctor and hospital gave us a letter stating that she could not fly and was not allowed to travel. We contacted Korean Airlines a few days in advance and explained the situation. The representative we spoke to explained that it did not matter if she had emergency surgery and that they would be charging us the exorbitant fee of $350. Almost half the price of her ticket. We made it known that she wanted to travel but was not allowed to. I made a clear case about why it was so unfair for them to charge her this amount considering the circumstances. Clearly this airline does not care about its passengers or about best business practices and is only concerned with making a profit regardless of how it affects human beings. Obviously, we will not fly Korean Airlines again and encourage everyone to avoid this airline at all costs.

Pleasant surprise,Vancouver,Fukuoka,International,On a recent trip to Japan (12 hour flight) I flew with this airline and was pleasantly surprised. My colleague had told me that this airline was terrible but I thought all the staff were very well trained and pleasant. The planes these days are very cramped for economy which makes the longer flights horrid but when you have good service it helps the discomfort. The only challenges I had were the tight turn arounds between my connecting flights on the same airline and ended up pretty stressed rushing through the airport in Korea which is pretty big so it was a small miracle I made it to my gate in time but I had to fight and even ask for help for them to hold the plane. This happened both ways and I was on the same airline for all connections. Perhaps the computer booking system needs a tweak to ensure when selling connecting flights there is indeed enough time in transit because if I was older I may not have made my flight.,May 2019,"July 7, 2019",4.0,,,,,,,,
Good solid airline,Seoul,Jakarta,Southeast Asia,Enjoyed flight thoroughly. Plane was a Boeing 777-300. Legroom was biggest that I have experienced on this type of aircraft.

Always delayed!!!,New York City,Seoul,International,"I’ve taken Korean Air from New York - Seoul for the past three flights, and EVERY TIME they were delayed 2 hours. Twice were due to engine problems and one because of “traffic” in JFK. Regardless, this kind of delay is simply unacceptable and can’t be just “undone” with smiles and apologetic attitude. When I took Alaskas airline, it gave everyone $50 voucher when it had a 30 min delay.

Seats wise, they are OK for economy with a bit of leg room between mine and the front seat.

ICN-JFK on A380 business class,Seoul,New York City,International,"It has been a while since I flew on Korean Air's A380 business class. The aircraft was an 8-year old one and showed some aging. I prefer the straight 2-2-2 arrangement of the seats to the staggered type found in other airlines. The flat-lie seat was comfortable enough, but the lack of storage spaces around the seat was a problem as I didn't have enough places to keep my smartphone, eyeglasses, and the water bottle safely. The movie selection on the IFE system was pathetic. Even the TV documentary selection was poor. They need to invest in this department. The meals were nice as one has come to expect from Korean Air, but one of my travel companions could not have her selection on the second meal. There was supposed to be a light meal or snack between the meals, but one had to ask for it. They used to go around the cabin with the snacks. In the ICN-JFK route, one has only two choices of airlines (KE and OZ), and KE has a slight edge because they have more flights.

First, we validated it by reviewing Tripadvisor's forums, which were positive.
Second, a friend who frequently visisits his som in Seoul gave Korean rave reviews.

380 business class,Los Angeles,Seoul,International,"I recently flew Korean air round trip Lax to Icn.  Upperdeck, all business class 2-2-2.

First off in my opinion all business class seats should have an aisle.  I was in the middle 2, so ok, but when I booked, lucky as only a few left.    I flew Air  France a few years back, it was the same.

The seats were the old style of business class.  I'm 6,1 and could not fully stretch out. Seat is not a full layflat.  Where the seat and seatback meat, it hits you in the hip.  The seat was the old style head rest that raises and folds to support your head.  It just gets in the way when laying down.

1 smallish pillow.  Blanket was good, but should have a padded comforter to cushion the seat.

Plane is quiet, entertainment screen was good, food was ok, drinks selection was limited.   Staff was very nice.

Don’t expect an abundance of choice or service, you are basically paying for the extra room.

Business on the 777,Singapore,Seoul,North Asia,"Business class of Korean Air 777 is certainly not in the same league as their 787. for starters, the seating is 2-3-2, which is really quite ridiculous in this day and age. Even airlines like Delta and Air France are using a 1-2-1 configuration and these are not even in the same league as SQ or Qatar. 

Korean Air most definitely need to quickly upgrade all their business to the prestige suites like those on the 787s. Having people climbing over you to go the washroom -- or for that matter having to climb over other people — is not acceptable for business class travel. And the Prestige sleeper with a width of only 20 inches is too narrow for proper sleeping. And it is not truly lie flat. It is slightly tilted lower at the feet. 

Another thing is the inflight meal - or rather lack of. Flight is 1.10 am departure - although it was delayed to almost 2 am. The only meal was breakfast 90 min before landing.

I've bought tickets going to Korea last year and unfortunately I couldn't make it at that time so I've called them to cancel my tickets. and service lady informed me that there's other option for holding the ticket and re-issue them for other dates instead of canceling. also, she've informed me that price would be different based on currency difference and I totally understood the situation.
However she've never informed me that when I re-issue tickets, I can only book tickets via phone with service team (which will costs you extra service fee). I've checked tickets were around $200 cheeper from their website but they won't let you buy your ticket with that price saying you are only available to process your re-issue purchase with serve team via phone and their system displays $200 more than the price from website. and there would be extra ""re-issue fee"" and another extra tax.

Airpoprt and Business Class Disappointment,Seoul,New York City,International,"There are two terminals at ICN.  I arrived at Terminal 1 and did not see my flight listed.  I panicked.  I went to the information booth and they told me my flight was in Terminal 2.  Nowhere on my ticket did it say my flight was leaving from Terminal 2 and nowhere in the information boards did it say this.  I now had to shelp my luggage outside again to take a bus to Terminal 2.  The two terminals are not close to each other.  They are a 20 minute plus bus ride apart, and getting my luggage into the bus was no easy task to begin with.  I could have gone directly to Terminal 2 if I had known.

The flight left at 10:00 A.M. and soon after we took off the crew started serving lunch.  I ordered vegetarian.  Since I was not hungry for lunch at such an early hour I asked to be served after everybody else.  There did not seem to be one or two attendants assigned to my section, and therefore I got asked several times if I wanted my meal by different people at different times.  Time went on and the cleanup was finished.  I never got my meal.  They forgot.  Since I still was not hungry at that point I actually did not mind.  After lunch was served there was not a single flight attendant to be seen.  I wanted some water and peaked behind the curtain to find a flight attendant.  I asked her for a bottle of water.  She looked all over and could not find one.  She then told me to sit down and she will try to find me some.  A few minutes later she returned with a bottle of frozen water.  She told me that was all she could find and that I should not worry, it will melt!

I have never been on a long haul flight where there the flight attendants did not continually offer water.  On this flight there was hardly any attendant to be seen except for meal time.  When they were in the cabin they were very nice, but they were hardly ever there.

In addition, the Business Class seats on this flight was in a 2-2-2 configuration, which means that one’s privacy is compromised. 

All this was very disappointing, especially in the business class cabin on a 14 plus hour flight.

An Exemplary Flag Carrier,Atlanta,Manila,International,"As a first time passenger of Korean Air from a long haul journey of around twenty hours to my destination, I was amazed at how the airline stewardesses and stewards pamper their guests. Yes, that was how I felt. Like a guest. Though I was seated in economy class I felt that their services were no different from their first class passengers: very efficient, with class.
Their well-coiffed, well-groomed staff bespeak of how Korean culture might be really this - an attention to details and impeccable service. Korean Air is truly a flag carrier for this country known for its beautiful culture, dubbed as the ""land of the morning calm.
It was indeed a pleasure to be on  Korean Airlines. If I may add, as one who requested for special service. being a senior citizen, for a wheelchair given the long walks to the assigned gate, my trip was expedited by their efficient airport staff, with no fuss at all.
Thank you Korean Air and the Terminal 2 staff at the Incheon International Airport.",May 2019,"June 4, 2019",5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0
Not Good,Los Angeles,Seoul,International,"The plane was clean, food was good, and I enjoyed the in-flight entertainment, but I think there's a lot of room for improvement on service.  In particular, making the rounds to pick up empty cups or other trash was done very infrequently. So if you drink slowly and miss the first round of pickup, or in my case, the flight attendant simply misses your row completely, you will have to hold on to your glass or cup for a long time, which is really annoying when you're in a cramped situation. Why didn't I simply just stop someone when they went by? Because I was sitting by a window and they WALK BY REALLY FAST. I've travelled on many U.S. and European airlines and this was the first time I've experienced this problem. 

Also, I'm Korean but can only speak and read English, which is obvious. I was given a Korean customs form and again, had to wait a long time to catch someone going by to ask for another form. 

Why didn't I just ring the bell instead of waiting? Because I had to ring it several times to ask for things like an extra pillow and half and half for my coffee. I should not have to ring the bell every time I want to get rid of trash, that would be ridiculous.  

All in all, not terrible, but not a top notch experience by any means. I would say my flights on Virgin, Alaska, Lufthansa and SAS were much better overall. Perhaps the high marks KAL gets is for its first and business class only? If so, that's a shame because service should be gracious on all.",May 2019,"June 2, 2019",2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
Fantastic customer service in Busan from counter staff,Busan,Jeju,Domestic,I cannot thank the counter staff in Busan enough for fantastic service. Unfortunately our flight to Jeju Island on Monday 27th May was cancelled due to bad weather. Next available flight would have meant losing a whole day in Jeju so we decided to cancel the Jeju trip and return to Seoul. The counter staff could not do enough to help us cancel all our services on the island and gave us a full refund on our flights. They faxed each hotel and car hire company with a formal letter from the airline asking for a full refund on all the services we had pre-booked. I was looking forward to flying KE but will definitely return to do Jeju another trip! Thank you to all so much.,May 2019,"June 2, 2019",5.0,,,,5.0,,5.0,,

The cabin crew were nice and helpful. Served whenever you requested. The airplane was very spacey. Upon return from my trip, the seats were empty, so some passengers were sleeping on two or more seats, so that was flying with comfort.

"Cool, calm, and collected staff",Jeju,Seoul,Domestic,"Korean Air rates as one of my favourite airlines (Inchon rates as my favourite airport; I've travelled to Korea five times in the past four years) and it is principally due to the attitude of its staff.

We were scheduled to fly out of Jeju at 1900 to Gimpo sand make our way to Inchon to catch a connecting flight at 2300 hours. This would have been a tight schedule for seven senior citizens who had completed a round-island bicycle ride.

There was a small glitch in our e-ticket so we went to Jeju at 1500 in case it took a while to sort out. While there, we asked about the possibility of being put on an earlier flight.

I should add that Jeju airport is very, very busy and I would very likely go mad if I had to work there. But the check-in clerk who spoke English (to my non-existent Korean; I can do hello, thank-you, and where's the toilet) coped very well with our request amid the noise generated by crowded airport with flights leaving every 10 minutes or so.

All of us managed to get on, saving us lots of anxiety at the other end, and the flight itself and the service was a delight. 

We were also impressed when we flew to Jeju after landing at Inchon and making our way to Gimpo for the domestic leg in our tiny window",May 2019,"May 28, 2019",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0
Nice enough,San Francisco,Seoul,International,First time KA flyer.  Unfortunately my SkyTeam Priority Elite Plus level did not get me much more than an aisle seat in economy.

Bumpy Ride with Excellent Service,Toronto,Seoul,International,"Now, turbulence is no ones fault but changing our seats is someone’s fault. I booked an aisle and a middle cause of mental health reasons as it is easier to get out of the seats and we were changed to a middle and a window which was a no go. The ladies at the check in desk at bag drop were super sweet about it and were able to change our seats to what was request. That’s an A+ in my book. The food was good; I requested a fruit platter and the attendants were quick to verify identities and after take off we got our meals quickly.

I would have liked a larger meal between the two as portions are small and I got hungry waiting. Maybe that’s something that could change in the future — there was a snack of sandwiches and bananas but it wasn’t enough.",May 2019,"May 27, 2019",5.0,,,,,,,,
Still Good inflight service but no help during transfer in Incheon Airport,Beijing,Las Vegas,International,"It is a first class seats, two leg flight, both leg on 777-300. First flight from Beijing to Incheon has only business class seating although they separate first row for first class. The food is decent and the wine is real good. The second leg has first class seating, a small cubic with wider seat which can be flatted into a small bed, and flight attendants will put a small mattress and comforter for you so it is quite comfortable. It even offers caviar in dinner and drinks generally good. The only thing that Korea air should improve is during transfer in Incheon airport, there is no help for first class and business class passengers at all, and the lounge staff although smiles nicely did nothing to help either.

A lot of stowing space, I especially liked the small places for securely storing my glasses and other small items. Service, food and beverage, in-flight entertainment on offer was ok, nothing exceptional, somehow I had expected more on flights with Korean Airways, but was already disappointed about the lounge at Tashkent airport and even more at Seoul airport, can't compete with Middle East airlines.

The Best I've Experienced,Seattle,Cebu Island,International,"I don't travel internationally often, but I had the chance in April of 2019 to fly with Korean Air going to Cebu, Philippines and I must say, they are a first rate airline in my book!  

As I was sitting in the concourse prior to boarding I saw the cabin crew off to the side having what I assumed was a discussion of expectations or pep rally of sorts. I was curious to know what was being said, but once on board what I witnessed from all of the crew was nothing short of 5 star service!  I've been on domestic flights around the US before and I don't think I've witnessed anything like the crew meeting before from any other airline.  Perhaps they do, but this is MY first time to see it.

From the quality of food, to the little things like a blanket, and slippers, they really do try to cater to your comfort and needs.  Each crew member I encountered was very friendly, spoke English, (my given language) and they were easy to understand.  Oh, and this was in the Economy section!

If ever I have a chance to use Korean Air again I wouldn't hesitate!

One of the best for customer service,Toronto,Seoul,International,"This was our first time flying with Korean Air. 2 adults and 4 children ages 8, 10, 11 and 13. 

The plane itself is typical in economy. However they provided a pillow, slippers, blanket, headphones and toothbrush when we arrived at our seats. The kids got special headphones and doodle book. 
Food was great in the sense that they provided multiple options.  They also provided more snacks as requested. My son was over the moon that he could get Ramen instant noodles at request with chopsticks to boot. 

What made our experience even better was that two of my children got sick on these flights. One was vomiting from the turbulence and the flight attendants were really amazing offering drinks and even medication for my wee one.  As well as check in every now and then to provide more barf bags and kind words. My other son had a massive bloody nose from the dry air and air pressure and they were quickl to provide whatever we needed.  

The only downfall is that when we landed in Korea to catch our next flight to Manila my one son had accidentally left his Competitive Hockey Jacket on the last plane. We went to information at Icheon Airport and the person barely spoke English. She couldn’t get a hold of anyone at the gate we were just at to ask and told us the lost and found was on the other side where we couldn’t access because we were getting a transfer flight. She told us to go to a lounge where Korean Air was located but after walking around the terminal for a half hour we found no one and when we went to a gate to ask an employee that worked for Korean Air he told us he didn’t speak English.

Avoid Korean Air,London,Osaka,International,"I took a flight from London to Osaka Kansai Airport via Seoul. The flight in London was 30 minutes or so delay. When I got to Seoul, they said I could not catch the connection flight to Osaka because we were in Seoul late. As I arrived the Seoul Airport, I was given a new boarding pass to Osaka which is a 3 hours wait in the Seoul airport. They gave me 10,000 Korean won voucher which is worth less than USD$9. Yup, just USD$9 and Korean Air expected me to use his voucher to get a meal at the Seoul Airport. No apology, no explanation,no sympathy. 3 hours or so, I finally boarded the flight from Seoul to Osaka. When I got to Osaka, it was nearly midnight, there was no train. I had to folk out USD$300 to get a taxi to Kyoto. Thanks a bunch, Korean Air.
After I got off the flight, I realised that I left my prescription glasses on the flight. I went on the Korean Air website. It says they would help looking for loss items incuding teddy bear. However, they don't say how we can contact them for that. I searched around the website, found a Customer Service email address which is customersvc@korean.com. I emailed them on 2 May, 2019.

Avoid if you have allergies,Nadi,Rome,International,"I have food intolerances and always request special meals without dairy. 

Despite my confirmed special meals, Korean air has been placing dairy products twice in my dairy-free during the same journey (an intercontinental flight that took around 24h in total).

After I had the problem the first time (on the way to Rome), I complained to the customer service. They sent me a generic email, did not offer any kind of compensation for their serious mistake and did not show in any way that they were taking the issue seriously. They also ignored my follow-up email.

And there again, on the way back I was given again a dairy product in significant quantities in my dairy-free meal. This time this was even more serious because the food label was in Italian only and it would have been impossible to non Italian speakers to realize that they had been served a milk product. 

This mistake is really serious because a person allergic to milk protein could have died on the flight because of this.

The reality is that Korean Air is not taking special meals seriously and you should avoid this airline if you have food intolerances or allergies. They may kill you.

I had heard good feedback from friends prior to this long-haul trip to USA so this round did not disappoint. I was most impressed with the service of the pilots and cabin crew: always friendly, professional, and cheerful which is a refreshing contrast to some US-based airlines. In fact, my fiancée also saw a pilot helping a passenger with her carry-on luggage. I was also thoroughly impressed by the food selection which offers up to 3 choices for every major meal. I always love the biibimbap (mixed rice) dish! The seat and legroom was fairly comfortable, enough to catch some rest on the flights. If I could make a suggestion it would be to add more English movies to the in-flight entertainment system, as I felt there were not many to choose from.

Korean Air crew were really helpful, friendly and professional. My 10hours flight was okay since it was a comfortable trip. Toothbrush and colgate are available in restrooms so I can save my travelling one....lol... By the way, they also have that in most ladies room at Incheon Airport.

    The First Class suite is wonderful; the food is wonderful; the service is wonderful.
And it did not stop when we landed; I was escorted to security and whisked through, and then the First Class Lounge was brilliant.

ORD to ICN to HCMC/Saigon - Korean Air Long Gentle Flights,Chicago,Ho Chi Minh City,International,"We used Korean Air on a spring trip to parts of Vietnam and Thailand.

Check in was great, seating was good, and flight staff were incredibly nice.

A ton of entertainment to choose from, seatback LCD screen sets are used, not wireless to a tablet or phone.

Food was very good/great, and there was a lot of it.

Our flights were:

-ICN to HCMC/Saigon  KE 685 DL7919 

-Bangkok to ICN  KE 654  DL7918
-ICN to ORD  KE 037  DL7863

We thought we would get more frequent flyer miles from these flights, since Korean Air is a Skypass partner, but we did not get the same amount of miles as we would have flying on Delta.  Ironically, these flights were booked through Delta...

This minor detour set aside, they were all great flights, and we would recommend Korean Air on flights to this part of the world from the US...

Why can't all airlines be like Korean Air?,Washington DC,Seoul,International,"We had a very good experience both on outbound and inbound flights on Korean Air. The seats were comfortable for economy class seats and there was sufficient legroom, but I say that as someone who isn't very tall.  I was able to cross my legs even with the seat in front me fully reclined.  

Meals were actually very good for economy class.  We especially enjoyed the bibimbap and loved the tubes of gochujang.  In-flight snacks were great - cup ramen and onigiris.  On the inbound flight, they ran out of the dish that my younger daughter wanted, and the other two were spicy, so the flight attendant actually went to a different class and brought her a meal that she could eat.  Great service!

I saw a grandmother traveling with an infant on her own, and the flight attendants were  so helpful to her and kind. It was nice to see that level of service.

The legroom was amazingly comfortable. 
The interior of the plane itself felt a bit old but that did not diminish the comfort of the flight.

I had requested a check in rep to correct my seating problem on the first leg of my trip but it wasn’t done. The food was better than on my outgoing flight but options and quality were not on par with other airlines. The staff was better then on my outgoing flight but not as attentive as other airlines.

I don't know if this fare is still available or if fares on other routes are as competitive, but I have no regrets in choosing Korean Air Business Class.

Midnight flight,Singapore,Seoul,North Asia,"Personally I disliked midnight flight but on the other hand, it was a great timing as I could start exploring the moment I arrived in Seoul. Stewards and stewardesses were polite. Aircraft was clean. Toilets are clean. Inflight movies selections are good too. The only thing was the beverages service. Maybe it was a midnight flight. They would expect everyone in the plane to sleep therefore, there was no snacks except for first drink you get after the plane took off. Thereafter, if you need any, you’ll need to call for service which I find it annoying because of the ding sound. Peanuts yes you have it. Other than that, nothing else. I coukdn’t sleep well on flights so was feeling hungry till I get my first meal at around 5am plus. I was very thirsty but do not wish to disturb the others who were sound asleep by pressing on the service bell!  I guess it would be great if the service staffs could walk around and offer their passengers drinks throughout the flight time. As for my return flight, it was an afternoon flight, slightly better than the midnight flight but I think there were passengers smoking inflight which was not allowed! The food served on both flights were alright. Would advise to take the Korean meals during flight. They tasted better than the usual food.",March 2019,"March 25, 2019",3.0,,,,,,,,

KAL first class in-flight food and overall service was a joke!,Hong Kong,Seoul,North Asia,I been using KAL first class service for the past 5 years or so. Their service has really went down hill every year. I remember when I first flew with them they were eager to please the passenger some even without asking. Now it's like a jobs they hate to do and they just want to do the very basic. In-flight meal service was a joke. The portion of the meal shrunk by at least 1/3 plus some side dishes were cut back. One time I asked for a mismatch meal from korean menu and western menu they just wouldn't even consider. They just told me they are different menu they can not serve like that.Overall service went from good to bad also. It took several tries to wave down a FA just to get a bottle of water. They would just walk by sometimes pretend they never saw be waving at them. I should have ignored about being rude and use the intercom on the control instead. That ss exactly what i will do if I eve fly them again..I remember 3 or 4 years ago they would ask if I need anything whenever they walk by seeing me awake and sit up.

Korean Air goes above and beyond,Seattle,Seoul,International,"We boarded the Korean Air plane from Seattle to Seoul on our way to Vietnam.  Just after liftoff, a flight attendant approached and asked me if I had left my wallet in Seattle.  I said that I hadn't.  She came back again and asked if I was sure about that.  I checked my travel bag and, sure enough, the purse with all our cash for the three week trip was gone.  She said that they had it at the Korean Air counter in Seattle and would put it in the safe and that they would return it to me on our return trip.  Well, I never expected to see it again and was very worried about the three credit cards that were with it. However, as we touched down in Seattle on March 18, the flight attendant came and said that they would meet me as I exited the plane and return the purse.  They did just that.  The money AND the credit cards were there.  I didn't have to look for the correct place to go ; they were waiting for me the minute I stepped off the plane.  Who does this?  Who on earth gives this caring customer service?  Korean Air, that's who.  I will always be indebted to them for their top notch customer service .  Plus. . .the plane is wonderful, flight attendants are wonderful, customer care is wonderful, leg room is great as is the entertainment screen in the back of the seats.

Good flight experience,Kuala Lumpur,Seoul,North Asia,"The overnight flight to Seoul was a bit uncomfortable because it's difficult to sleep with the noise of passengers who keep ringing bells. But Good thing is due to the flight delay from KL, Korean Air provided refreshments and blankets at the airport. But meals on board was served kinda late so you tend to get hungry on the overnight flight.

The return flight was a better experience. I had The whole row to myself. And there were 2 meals served on board.

The entertainment choices were satisfactory. The overnight flight was provided with bedroom slippers and dental care. The special meal requests was very good too. They gave me salmon for my seafood meal.

The downside of Korean Air to me was the luggage limit. They only allowed 23kg free luggage allowance. 

But if you fly with Korean Air you get to arrive and depart from Terminal 2. Which I find is a better Terminal compared to the old Terminal 1.

Such good service on board but no help for comprehension when a problem occurs .,Toronto,Seoul,International,"Our Travel agent convinced us to fly with Korean air for our trip to Vietnam.  It was not the company we chose and we had no intention to fly with Korean Air which have no direct flight to Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City , Vn.

Because we took a package with our agent, we could obtain a better price flying with Korean Air.  And we did.

We left Ottawa for Toronto with WestJet early morning on SUNDAY February 27, 2019 where we were going to fly from T.O. To Seoul with Korean Air.

Approximately one hour before departing and ready to board,  we were advised that the flight has been delayed for 11hours.  We were offered to stay at he airport to their lounge or go to the hotel at the airport for the period.  Both alternatives were covered by Korean Air.  

Because of my limited mobility,we chose to stay at the airport’s lounge where we spent all day.  Even though the departure was late ,  we had a good flight, good food and good services .

Because the flight was late,we could not connect to the other flight going to Ho Chi Minh City .  We had made reservations for 4 nights from February 18 to February 22nd prior to our departure with a possibility of cancelling  48 hours before our arrival the date of our stay.

Korean air did help us to catch the first flight to HCMC after we arrived inSeoul.

While we were inToronto we sent different messages to our agent, to the representative of our tour in Vietnam and to the company taking care of our tour while in Vietnam.

Instead of arriving on the 18 of February,we arrived on the 19th.  The hotel was fully paid before our departure and we could not reimbursed approximately $ 200.

We wrote to Korean airlines and we were refused the payment of the room and any kind of compensation for the day lost of our holidays.

We lost one full day of our vacation and the price of the room.

Of course we agreed that Safety of the plane and passengers is essential but we also believe that we should be reimbursed for our lost as we were not responsible for the delay.  Korean air did.",February 2019,"March 7, 2019",3.0,,,,,,,,

We were very pleased with the amazing service, excellent food, and comfortable seating. One of the ways that you are able to discern a good business is how they handle problems. Our bags were misplaced by American Airlines in Chicago. Korean Air held off on closing the door as long as possible hoping our bags would arrive. When they did not, they assured us that they would take every measure possible to be sure our bags would eventually get to our hotel in Bali. In Bali upon arrival they had signage to make us aware that our bags were still missing. Even though the missing bags were not their fault they gave us $100US in Bali currency for the inconvenience.

I used a small fan to give a little breeze.  She again said she would adjust temperature.

For U.S. citizens, that means you are through Immigration very fast. My best time is 12 minutes. Compare that to the typical pileup at Los Angeles Int'l.

When I reached Incheon airport, they told me all seats were fully booked so I had to settle for a middle seat.

Once I was moved, the lady next to me (with her toddler) asked the stewardess if she can request her husband seated at the back to also move in front.  Since there is no more seat available I told the stewardess I would go back to my old seat so her husband can sit with her.  She said, no need and she will figure out a way.  A few minutes after we left, she told me she could move to another aisle seat reserved to stewardesses and the husband moved to my seat.

The flight was pleasant as the stewardesses made sure that the toilets were always clean and don't smell permeating the cabin.
I love the attention to detail for Korean Air, providing toothbrushes and tooth paste for passengers to use after every meal.
The drawback is the layover of 4 hours in Seoul... wish it could be shortened to help us weary travelers to get to our destination quicker and have rest.

Good Korean meal option,Mumbai,Vancouver,International,First time flying with Korean Air. They had a Korean meal option which I had twice on my way home. Flight attendants are polite and kind. Overall it was pretty good. What I would like to recommend is to take one of the free transit tours offered at the airport if you have more than five hours to kill in between flights. I had about five hour layover s so I took 'two hour Incheon City Tour' which was fun. It was in mid-January and I was coming from India. Incheon was pretty cold but they even offered us down jackets to wear. I thought those free transit tours are fantastic.

Customer Service is King with Korean Air,Chicago,Seoul,International,"With a son, daughter-in-law and grands living in South Korea, we regularly travel there to visit. We originally chose Korean Air because of the direct flight they offer out of Chicago O’Hare. But we’ve stayed with them, for the last seven years, for so many other reasons.
We fly economy but feel we are treated like we are seated in first or business class. It is a long flight and the airline and staff do so much to make it a comfortable and enjoyable experience. Pillows, blankets, bottles of water, slippers, headphones and toothbrush w/toothpaste are waiting in your seat for you. On board entertainment is very good - I’ve seen countless new movie releases during these flights. 
And from serving regular full meals and snacks, to warm cloths and regular rounds with juice and water, you see and interact regularly with the kind, polite, professional and well-trained staff. If you need something they haven’t already provided, the staff is there to help. There are quite a few babies and small children on these flights and the staff are helpful to these families. I’ve seen the staff holding babies and doing other things to help traveling families with babies get and stay situated. I can’t say enough about the efforts the staff make to keep us all happy and comfortable.

It was average,Brisbane,Seoul,International,"Korean airlines what I donot like they are not aware of the visa regime of Korea for 3rd countries citizens and no matter how travel compliant we are, we are not allowed to do online check in, which is bit discriminatory , they allow to do online check in every body from 1st world countries .
2nd thing because staffs are not updated, it hold me back in airport and in last moment I have to really rush for flight, which I donot appreciate.
3rd thing, the luggage for such a long haul flight is only 23 kg and cabin luggage is 7 kg, that much luggage every short haul carrier still provide in most routes.
They donot allow you carry few more kg in cabin bagage and asked to take some kgs off, which is very odd for such long flights.

Wonderful Service No Matter Where I Was,Bangkok,Minneapolis,International,"I was traveling from Minneapolis to Bangkok and had a number of Delta and Korean Air segments in my trip. My flights to Bangkok were mostly on Delta, with Korean providing the last segment to Bangkok, but my flights home were mostly on Korean due to a Delta cancellation.  I had a business class seat (Prestige Class) throughout.

Overall, I really enjoyed flying Korean Air. When I checked in for my flights in Bangkok, everything was carefully explained to me (in perfect English) and all of my boarding passes and bag tags were assembled in a neat little package in the order I would need them.  I was quickly through fast track security and into the shared lounge.  The lounge left a bit to be desired, but the lounges in Incheon more than made up for it.

The flight from Bangkok to Incheon was on an Airbus 380 and business class was the entire top deck of the plane, with lounges at either end.  My first impressions were that it was very spacious and very clean, and there were flight attendants every 2-3 rows to welcome you and guide you to your seat. The seat itself was very comfortable in both sitting and sleeping modes.  In flight movies were in a variety of languages.  The food was quite good with both Korean offerings and western food.

The lounges in Incheon was very nice and I took the opportunity to have an additional breakfast and take a shower.  Again, the food was a variety of Korean and western dishes, all of which were delightful. The shower was clean and wonderfully warm.  It was a good way to (re-)start the day.   

My flight to Chicago was on a 777.  I sat in the section behind first class, but ahead of the business class galley.  There are two rows of business class there.  It was very quiet despite proximity to the galley.  We had two ""dedicated"" flight attendants that both spoke perfect English for six of us.  As on the A380, the seats were comfortable in both sitting and sleeping modes and there were a lot of movies and tv shows to watch.  Similarly, the food was great, whether it was a steak (for lunch) or pizza (mid-flight snack) or stir fried chicken (for my third ""breakfast"" of the ""day"").  

Upon landing in Chicago, all of the flight attendants again lined up to thank each passenger personally.  It was a nice touch to (almost) end a long day of flying.

Overall, I would fly Korean Air anytime I was going to Asia.  Delta will soon be offering direct flights from MSP to Incheon starting in 2019, so Incheon and connecting flights on Korean Air will be my go-to for future trips to Asia.",January 2019,"January 29, 2019",5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0

Night and day difference!,New York City,Seoul,International,"In USA, you always stick to one airline to get mileage points & other benefits. However, you’ll never know what’s being offered from other airlines until you try one for the sake of it. Korean Airlines is one of them, and you’ll see the difference in service. From check in, to boarding the plane, and stewardess’s services in the plane are way better than in USA. They’re young, pleasant looking, smiling, nice uniforms, eager to please, assist and help customers. They seem to be constantly busy working serving customers in their needs whether assisting in putting luggage in the top bin, find their seats, serving seconds, or even making sure the restrooms are clean and with refreshing smells. And I’m sorry to say that US plane services are lacking and stewardesses are lazy and because they’re experienced and older, they don’t seem to care.
p.s. I left my jacket in the plane, and I just tried to ask in my return flight 10 days later and walahhhh!!! they have it, showed me the picture and gave it to me as I boarded the plane.",December 2018,"January 19, 2019",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
Surprisingly not the Friendliest Airline,Brisbane,Las Vegas,International,"I have to say I was very disappointed in their lack of friendliness. Lack of food as well for two long haul flights. Trip over was really bad service for 12 hours we got only two small meals one hour into the flight and one hour at the end of 11 hours, no snacks. The return trip the plane was a big bigger and seemed to have more room and more food on offer. The sad bit was both directions the lack of smiles from the staff and lack of interaction with the customers which I found rather bizarre as I really thought they would be really friendly. Not sure if it is the language barrier but they did speak English. Would not jump at a chance to go again unless the price was really cheap. Just having to ask for water and they filled a plastic cup half full and disappeared, no sticking around in case you wanted more. Disappointed.",December 2018,"January 18, 2019",2.0,,,,,,,,
Comfortable seats and good service. Lounges lacking.,London,Auckland,International,"Two flights between UK and Auckland. First leg in a 747 and second on a 777ER. The prestige suites on both legs were good, although at over 2M tall, a few extra CMs would have been handy. Onboard service was very good and food was of a good standard and plentiful. Wine choices also good and could not fault the service. Where Korean Airlines does let’s itself down is the IFE and lounges. The lounge at Heathrow T4 lacked anything impressive and the inability to top up the food was noticeable. The lounge at Seoul was also lacking, with a very poor choice of beverages and food. You simply can’t compare with the likes of Virgin Upper Class lounges or Emirates. The IFE had a handful of reasonably recent titles, but lacked choice and again falls short of a number of other airlines.

Best airline going to Asia.,Montreal,Manila,International,"We flew from Montreal to Philippines during the Christmas holidays.
Nothing to worry about with this airline. I flew many times with other airlines (china airline, Jal,Air Canada) So far Korean Air was my favorite

Good food. They give you a choice of either a western meal like chicken or beef with vegetables or Korean food like bulgogi , bibimbap.

Seats was comfortable with A lot of leg room. They gave me the exit door seat which gave me even more space! Plus they give you flip flops,eye shades for sleeping,pillows and blankets. The seats reclines a lot as well compare to other airlines I find. TV entertainment was good as well. lots of games and new movies.

The service was amazing they are kind and Polite.
Here is a tip. Ask for cup noodles! they give them for free and I find a good snack while everyone is sleeping.

"Good flight, but poor food/beverage service",Chicago,Seoul,International,"It was my first time on a long-haul flight (~14 hrs). The flight was good, and the in-flight entertainment options were good. Bathrooms were kept clean for the duration of the flight. I was a little surprised by the quality of the food/beverage service. Non-alcoholic beverages (water/juice) were not offered frequently enough, which can get very uncomfortable on a long flight, since the air gets very dry. Whenever beverages were offered, the hostesses seemed to prefer to limit it to one half-full cup a person. I found that a little baffling, as the cups were not full, and understandably people were thirsty, especially since beverages were not being served too frequently. Several individuals explicitly asked for more, and the hostesses' displeasure appeared apparent. Relatedly, food service was also not great. I requested chicken as an entree, and it was covered in a congealed, gelatinous substance, despite being heated. We were also not fed frequently. I have traveled other carriers on ~8-9 hr flights, and felt we got more food options. Overall, it was an okay flight. In future, I might try a different carrier. Another key caveat is that the service levels could be much better in higher classes, but this review is based on my experience in economy class.",December 2018,"January 17, 2019",4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,2.0
Cannot fault.  Totally awesome.,Brisbane,New York City,International,This was our first experience flying Korean Air and we LOVED it.

Great service. Wish baggage policy can be revised,Singapore,Seoul,North Asia,"It was my first time travelling on Korean Air (SG-INcheon). Seats were comfortable with leg space comparable to SG national carrier. Love the service on board especially the hot snacks before landing eg banana, onigiri, nuts, pizza, sandwich (though sandwich was not that great amongst all). Famous bibimbap is beef with no other meat option which was sad. 

Why did i not take korean air in the past? Reason is its checked baggage policy of 23kg one bag only. Written to koreanair to appeal to them to relook into this for sectors outbound from Korea only: to consider increasing the allowance to 2 bags per pax max 33 or 30kg on a minimum. However it has been a few months with no reply. If they would consider this recommendation, it encourages tourism spending which is good for its own nation's economy. Sometimes it is not possible to pack everything into one bag hence this policy is too restrictive. To purchase additional baggage would be too cost ineffective. 

Hope they can look into this again to become a competitive carrier that is doing its duty to help its own nation! I will gladly be a repeat customer!",October 2018,"January 17, 2019",4.0,,,,,,,,

Prestige Class on Korean Air,Los Angeles,Manila,International,"I flew on Korean AIr's Prestige Class for the first time between Los Angeles and Manila. In between was a layover in Incheon, and a change of planes. On both legs, going and coming back, I was in Prestige Class. They have different versions of this, and the one I had was the Prestige Sleeper. Your seat turns into a sleeper bed.
On the long haul flight from Los Angeles to Incheon, the Prestige Class was located on the second level of the plane (one of those huge double decker planes). The leg room was more than ample, as there had to be a big clearance between seats for the seat to turn into a sleeper. The sleeper was not cushy, but it was comfortable.
Service was very attentive, and the food was a grade higher than normal airplane food.  You had your choice of alcohol if you wished; and speaking of alcohol, there were 2 lounge bars on this level, one in the front, and one in the back. I availed of this lounge on the way back to L.A. It was just nice to sit in the lounge for a change, and not be tethered to your seat the whole flight.
The restrooms were kept clean the whole time. It's also interesting how most of the passengers in this class did not have so much carry-ons, so there was a lot of overhead bin space.
One thing to note is the expensive fare for this class. Given that I traveled during the holiday season in December, but checking the fares for mid-February, it was still the same rate.
On a side note, Incheon has a new Terminal 2 for Korean Air, and it is wonderful! Shopping (duty free and luxury), lots of food choices, even showers and massage. Since I was in Prestige, I was able to avail of the KAL Lounge, and they provide food and beverages. And the best yet are the showers, which I availed of on the way back to L.A. because of a long layover. The showers (around 6 of them) are a full bathroom each and very clean. 
Overall, if you have the money to spend, I would recommend Korean Air's Prestige Class (if you get the Sleeper version, even better) for long haul trips, as it makes a difference in the comfort and calmness of a plane ride, and you get to your destination just a bit more relaxed.",December 2018,"January 15, 2019",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Auckland to Frankfurt Return - A Great Alternative!!,Auckland,Frankfurt,International,"Having flown to Europe through the Gulf on previous trips, we decided a change was in order and flew Korean via Seoul. 
The long layover in Seoul on the outward trip turned out to be better than we  expected. The timing of the flights to Europe means both legs are completely in daylight whilst the return legs are both at night. This meant we got a very comfortable nights sleep in a hotel (the Hyatt, Incheon) on the outward journey.
The staggered seating of window seats meant that whilst not exactly side by side, access to and from the window seat was easy without having to climb over the isle seat. 
The service was great - the attentiveness of the crew on these long sectors never was wanting. Good food - steak cooked to your wishes (and a great steak as well!), plenty of fluids, and comfortable lie flats for a few hours sleep.
The lounges at each airport met our needs with the shower at Incheon on our return most welcome.

Great service and comfortable journeys,Dallas,Phuket,International,"We recently flew Korean Air (Boeing 777-300) during several international flights (including a flight over 15 hours in length).  We were delighted by the level of service exhibited by the crew, as well as the comfort of the economy seats we experienced.  From the time we checked in, every staff member we encountered was friendly, polite, and focused on ensuring that we had the best experience possible.  They truly looked like they enjoyed their jobs, which made for a really pleasant flight.  The plane was spacious, the seating was comfortable, and they somehow managed to keep the cabin and bathrooms nearly spotless throughout the entire flight.  (We’re still trying to figure out how they made that happen!)  Simple conveniences were provided to every passenger—including water bottles, pillows, blankets, slippers, toothbrushes, toothpaste, and headphones.  They even passed out activity kits to the kids on board and had a special row of the plane dedicated to families traveling with young children.  (They attached 2 bassinets to the panel, lined them with comfy blankets, and invited 2 young children to sleep in them overnight.)  Prior to the flights, the flight attendants even stopped by our seats and verified our special dietary needs, placing stickers on our seats to avoid mistakes later on in the flight.  They never missed a special meal or snack—and the food was actually pretty tasty.  The only 2 minor downsides of the flight were that they didn’t have individual air controls at each seat so you could adjust the temperature better, and their windows didn’t have the higher-tech shaded controls.  However, those were really minor details to us, given the overall experience, and we emerged from our international flights feeling relatively relaxed and refreshed.       

In comparison, the last leg of our journey was run by American Airlines (Boeing 787) and it was a sub-par experience.  The American crew members were not as friendly as their Korean counterparts during the flight.  They forgot to arrange for half of the special meals for us (which were ordered several months in advance); that caused their staff to scramble for random snacks so we wouldn’t go completely without food for more than 8 hours.  The seats were those terribly uncomfortable (hard and ergonomically unfriendly) skinny seats they tend to use now in short, domestic flights.  The space between seats was less than 1 foot and my knees were pressed against the seat in front of me the entire time, which felt very enclosed given the duration of the flight.  They quickly ran out of headphones and other basic supplies for guests after less than 1/3 of the passengers were served.  The bathrooms and cabin were dirty half-way through the flight.  Even though the flight was shorter than our Korean Airlines flight, it seemed to drag on forever.  We left this flight with very sore shoulders and backs.

So our recommendation would be to avoid flying American Airlines to international destinations and instead consider Korean Air as an excellent alternative. 

(An added bonus is that Incheon Airport offers low-cost tours of Seoul if you have a long layover.  So, this was the first time we intentionally scheduled a long layover.  It gave us the opportunity to get a taste of South Korea.  We visited one of the historical palaces and walked around the Insadong area, which included snack vendors, shops, Hanbok photo shoots, a temple, etc.  It was a nice way to break up the monotony of international travel while also experiencing a whole other culture.)",December 2018,"January 13, 2019",5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

Fabulous support by the Team @ Korean Air,Auckland,Mumbai,International,"I flew out on 26 Dec to Mumbai via Seoul.  Our flight was delayed by 40 minutes which made the connecting flight a challenge.  3/4s into the flight, the flight attendant informed those connecting on the onward journey to Mumbai that they would hold the aircraft until we boarded but our luggage would likely be transferred to another flight at a later time.  Other passengers were going to be travelling onwards from Mumbai, and they did mention it to the flight crew.  
On arrival @ Seoul, the ground staff took charge and led us immediately through the airport, customs / immigration and to the departure gate for the connecting flight.  They had delayed the flight by another 20 mins, but when the Captain (I think was told) that connecting baggage was THE key part of the connection, he delayed the aircraft by another 30 mins.  Lo and behold, with the Captain's expertise, he landed on time in Mumbai in spite of the delay in departure.  The icing was all our baggage came through.  I went round the belt with a cheer, when I received my baggage giving a Thumbs up sign to those who were waiting with baited breath.  However, all of them got their baggage shortly and you could see some happy travellers.
On my return back to Auckland, I had tummy issues and requested only dry bread with coffee, which the air crew very kindly gave me.  I found the crew outgoing and incoming to Auckland to be polite, courteous and very helpful.  I was very impressed with the spaciousness of the 777 and the Airbus.

So much is made if the distinction between business a d first class that the lounges are separate and the business lounge is no better than sitting in the main terminal.

London to New Zealand - Business class at a premium economy price,London,Auckland,International,"I researched the best premium economy fares to NZ over Christmas and New Year but was disappointed in the possible stopovers (there aren't many airlines doing PE and most involved places we'd been before). I was offered Prestige Class fares on Korean Air for a similar price, and the idea of a flat bed for 2 *12 hour flights each way was appealing. We were also able to include a few days stopover in Seoul at no extra cost, plus the hotel was provided for the night on our return journey. 

We were very impressed with the space and service on 3 of our 4 flights. In particular on the return flight from Incheon to London, we were in the upper deck of a 747, with only 20 seats - it was very quiet and spacious, with 2 or 3 crew most of the flight.

The only flight I was less impressed with was Auckland to Incheon -  a day flight. The crew seemed to act as if it was a night flight - we had a meal on take off, but a 7 hour gap before the next. There were few snacks available when we asked for them, so we asked to have our meal early. The crew also tried to get us to keep the blinds closed, despite it being daylight for the entire flight, and us wanting to look at the views.  The following day flight from Incheon to London could not have been more different - again a meal on take off but as I would expect for a long flight, regular servings of water and snacks. 

I would definitely use again if they flew to my chosen destination, and am considering a holiday in South Korea as Seoul has whetted my appetite to see more.",December 2018,"January 6, 2019",5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
Business class was nice,New York City,Tokyo,International,Really nice flight. Comfortable seats. Great food and service. Enjoyed the lounge in business class.

Spacious and Comfortable Flight to South Korea,Singapore,Seoul,North Asia,"Our flight tickets to Korea were booked in August, four months before our actual flight and it cost us $1210 (inclusive of a return domestic flight between Gimpo Airport and Jeju Airport). As OCBC bank had a promo tie-up with Korean Air, we had a discount of $82 and paid only $1128.

In-flight service was good and the in-flight entertainment was well-stocked to keep us entertained throughout our flight. The leg room for the economy seats are surprisingly wide and spacious as we have been on flights of similar aircraft type with different airlines and usually, they were quite crammed. However, for Korean Air, there’s really enough leg room for a good stretch.

The on-flight duty free shop though, is pretty pricey and wasn’t enticing enough for us to buy any collectibles.",December 2018,"January 5, 2019",4.0,,,,,,,,

All the other Asian airlines, China Air, EVA Air, etc. share a common Lounge across the hallway. It is absolutely beautiful.
Korean Air has its own Lounge. It is filthy!
The furniture is soiled and stained. The carpeting is filthy. The walls are stained with black mold...yes, mold!
This is disgraceful! 
The President of Korean Airlines should spend 12 hours here, like we are forced to do. He would feel like he needs a shower, like I do.

They told , and not in good manners,  that I have to leave because ONLY people drinking absolute vodka can stay and enjoy the area, they even remove the nibbles.

From Australia to Israel,Melbourne,Tel Aviv,International,"Flights from Australia to Israel with Korean Air are from Sydney alone. The good thing is that when you check in in Melbourne they send your luggage straight to Tel Aviv. The greatest thing is that Korean offers a night in a five stars hotel in Seol on the way to Tel Aviv which is refreshing and great. You also have time for a short tour in Seol of you feel like it. I just enjoyed a good night sleep and a delicious breakfast. You need to ask for the hotel when you book your ticket though it is on the airline expense. Buying a ticket from the company rather than an agent allows you to change flight dates at minimum costs. Great service and reasonable price, not cheapest though.",April 2018,"December 18, 2018",5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
The Best Airline so far for me,Auckland,Manila,International,"I would say that Korean Air offered the best service when I went to the Philippines for a holiday back in Dec 2015. The food was awesome and the attendants were all polite and cheerful. 
Our flight going back from Manila to Auckland was the best. We had a stop-over at Korea (of course) and we arrived at around 2 am. Since our connecting flight was not until 5 pm of the same day, Korean Air gave me and my hubby the chance to stay in a five-star hotel for free and with a free breakfast as well! And that was really an exciting experience for me since I know I would only go for bnb. Korea also have free bus tours around Korea but we decided not to use it and opt to go on our own for an adventure out to Seoul on a -17 degree Centigrade temp outside. 
I would really recommend anyone to use Korean Air on their next flight to the Philippines in particular.",January 2018,"December 18, 2018",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Ms Crystal Cooper,Nashville,Seoul,International,"I haven't traveled yet but I made a reservation on November to flying to KAL in March 2019.  I made a reservation directly to Korean Airline web site.  

I had to change flight schedule 3 times (within an hour). Each time I called Korean Airline before I made a change.
But I was charged 3 times.

Evidently,  the girls answered the phone didn't get my messages or they need to hire someone understands English. 3 different girls didn't get it!

But now all are okay with charges after I called AMEX.

But I received a wrong itinerary from KAL it shows I am going to Busan instead ICN (Seoul).  

Also I found out my real itinerary indicated I am frying from ICN to USA with Delta.  I told her that if I wanted fly with other flight, I didn't make a reservation thru KAL web. She said if I want to change to KAL, I have to pay $170+ more!  I was furious but I didn't want to pay extra.  

During conversations with KAL agent, she said somthing about time was changed from Atlanta to Nashville and also said she will send me a new itinerary within 24 hours.

Consistently good flight expeience,Auckland,Moscow,International,My wife and I have used the Korean Air Seoul route to Moscow quite a few times. Made a mistake going another country route and regretted it big time. Korean airlines deliver a consistent quality travel experience. For this route they are the airline of choice because of the airside hotel (see another of my reviews) in Incheon airport. It was as comfortable as you can expect for economy. Food was tasty and we always got our choice which was not too pungent and meat was always tender. Food was one of the highlights of the trip.

A Great Way to Fly.,Sydney,Prague,International,"A good option to go this route to Europe, if you have time. The flight arrives in late afternoon in Seoul, and, due to the onward second leg to Prague leaving around midday the following day, It arrives late afternoon in Prague too, you are accommodated usually at the Grand Hyatt Hotel. The airfare price is inclusive of buffet meals, evening and breakfast. When you are a in Seoul you have to find your way to  Korean Air Transfer desk, where you will be put on a transit bus to the hotel, and, the next day return by the same means. On Checking in to your hotel you will receive your meals vouchers. Advise the staff of your  next flight details. The service, and, food in th hotel is top notch. The Korean Air flight staff very good, food also good, the entertainment system is probably not the Most advanced.

As Good As Singapore Airlines,Sydney,Barcelona,International,My wife and I flew Korean from Sydney to Barcelona in September 2018. It is a very good airline with comfortable economy seats and good service. Just check near departure to ensure there has been no change of aircraft as my wife and I ended up seated two rows from the rear toilets because of an unadvised change of aircraft and arbitrary change in seating. The flight will entail a layover however in Inchon but that will leave you refreshed for the onward leg the following day which was for us a good feature. The same applied in March 2016 when we flew from Sydney via Inchon to New York. In Inchon we stayed at the Grand Hyatt which as previously was excellent and reasonably priced although its meals are expensive. With the new terminal and its extensive food outlets vis a vis the old terminal with its minimal and almost exclusively Asian food outlets eating at the airport might be an option. Sydney to inchon flight was from memory 13 hours and the Inchon to Barcelona flight was also 13 hours. Strangely the return legs were both shorter. The choice of Korean was in 2016 price based and having been satisfied we flew with them in 2018. I would have no hesitation recommending Korean and the Grand Hyatt.

Above Average for Economy Fare,Toronto,Manila,International,"We had a three hour stopover in Seoul and throughout the journey the airline was on time for the flight schedule. The flights were comfortable. The legroom was much more comfortable than AirCanada international flights. The temperature in the cabin was kept more moderate than usual flights I’ve taken to Asia, Europe or Africa.

The food in Economy was the best I’ve had. We preordered Seafood meals, as we always do and they were very good. Meals included smoked salmon twice, cod fish, shrimp, scallops and squid. Of course , the meals from Seoul to Manila were better because the food service came from Korea rather than Toronto but both were good. 

The flight attendants were attentive to the children and they were very helpful with things like water whenever requested as well as ramen noodles. The only thing I would suggest is that if you want ramen noodles request them earlier in the flight. As with many flights to Asia, ramen noodles are popular and sometimes they do not have sufficient servings available; as was the case with this flight. 

I also appreciated that the Korean Airlines staff at Pearson International was not overly strict about being slightly overweight with our baggage. We did arrive early for checkin, so perhaps that was a factor, I would recommend arriving earlier for checkin if you have a small overweight issue. I did notice they were charging others who seemed to be grossly overweight in the luggage allowance, but the staff was apologetic for this and tried to be as accommodating as possible. I was about 2-3 kgs overweight with each piece. They also did not weigh my carry on luggage which was a small very overweight piece of luggage and a large backpack. I also carried a twin sized comforter and pillow on-board, an umbrella and a small bag with snacks, all with no questions asked.

Overall I would most certainly recommend and fly with Korean Airlines again. Oddly enough, although the economy service was among the best I’ve had, the fare was the cheapest to be found at the time of my traveling.",December 2018,"December 13, 2018",4.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Great Value for Money and the Best Stopover Ever.,San Francisco,Manila,International,"I booked my flight on Delta.com but I guess Korean Air and Delta have a code-sharing agreement so I ended up on Korean Air for the first time in my life.  The price of the economy flight was almost half that Delta charges so I picked it.

The flight had a 12 hour layover in Incheon which I thought a bit odd but turned out be great because Incheon Terminal 2 is one airport you'd love to stay in for a layover.  Free showers, free lounge and great choices of food at reasonable prices.  

I guess this review is more about Incheon Terminal 2 than about Korean Air.  To be fair, Korean Air was a good airline at par or maybe a little better than Delta.  (Delta is my favorite airline)  The service and food was good,  the flight left and arrived exactly on time and it was so easy to make my connection.   Also, I felt that the smiles of the Flight Attendants were genuine.

"Where was the ""Excellence in Flight""",Washington DC,Bangkok,International,"First, I want it to be known this was not my first flight on Korean Air. I have flown them 9 times in the past and was in love with this airline.  This time around I have to say after 3 years using other carriers I was looking forward to the trip knowing the 5 star service I had in the past.  I have to say the fact I could not select my seats until 24 hours before the fight and having them chosen for me before I even checked in was upsetting.  In the end I did get the seats I preferred. As for the service the flight started out great smooth, staff was friendly then came the meal service.

I have to say you can see that in three years they have not kept up the service, they had 3 selections however the dinner was short any cheese and cracker, desserts or ice cream like in the past. You can see how they have cut corners.  The snack before was pizza this time it was a stuff bun on a napkin.  The same went for the second meal. A salad and main dish and a roll, they never offered any wine just water on the second meal service.  

In the past they came down the rows offering juice and water almost every hour this time just 3 time on a 14 hour flight.  I believe the attendants have gotten lazy .  They also kept the cabin so hot, my traveling partner had to take his outer shirt off and just wear a T-shirt. I also noticed they removed the foot rest from all aircraft a huge mistake. 

I will say at least the connecting flight was a little better but not like before. 

The entertainment system could offer more selections come on its all electronic and they could get rid of all those magazines and make them electronic versions and save money there most people dont even read them anymore .

The other final issue is how in 2018 does a major international airline not offer any wifi. I read that Korean people dont like slow wifi on airlines however this is not just for them. I used wifi on Qatar, Finn Air, Delta, American and they are all fine for texting with friends and killing time on a flight, If people dont want to use it then they have an option not too 

I have to say ANA, Qatar, Cathy Pacific and JAL which I used in the past 3 yeas was much better food service, entertainment and options even in economy. Just because a person is flying economy doesnt mean they are to be treated as such. I will rethink flying Korean in the future",December 2018,"December 11, 2018",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0

Efficient and Elegant Trip,Los Angeles,Seoul,International,"For my first flight to Korea I decided I needed to fly Korean Air. I could only afford Economy and initially was a little nervous about going so far without being able to recline all the way but I had no reason to worry. My flight left at 11:30pm and I settled in to sleep. About 30 min in they fed us (so our full bellies would sleep longer?!) it was fun to assemble and delicious!  I was excited to get Korean food already on the plane to set the tone. I actually slept really well. I did get up like once to stretch my legs but slept most of the time.  I had the window seat so I could lean against the wall to sleep. 

It was a strange feeling knowing we were constantly chasing the sunrise (we landed a day and a half after we left just due to time change - but coming home I think we landed within a few hours of when “we left”). As they raised the light in the cabin to wake us up we smelled a decent breakfast!  

Things I loved about flying this airline. It is like a fine tuned precise operation. You MUST be there ahead of your flight. If you cut it too close you lose (but then the folks on the plane are not delayed all because of you). You must put seats up when eating. 1 bag is included in airline fee. The food was included. The flight crew is perfection from their manners to mannerisms, their uniforms and complexions - I know that is weird but I couldn’t stop admiring them. They had usb cords so people could plug in their phones. I would definitely fly them again! Worth the extra money compared to other airlines.

"Weird Terminal change from domestic flight by Delta to Terminal 1, and partners need better service",New York City,Seoul,International,"Traveled from DC to Asia, and going through Seoul results in cheaper flights. Bought tickets through Delta, but the JFK-Asia portion was by Korean Airlines (which is an awesome airline, but they don’t provide wi-fi on their international flight -supposedly because south korea has one of the best wi-fi services on the planet, so satellite-based wi-fi used by planes is so much slower and thus not worth disappointing the airline’s clientele).

You would think transferring between flights operated by partners would be relatively easy, BUT upon arrival from a domestic flight (Terminal 2) at JFK, you have to transfer terminals in a weird way. Normally, you can transfer between terminals via connecting corridors, shuttles, trains, etc. At JFK, we had to completely EXIT Terminal 2, and walk via a narrow sidewalk over to Terminal 1, and go through the security checkpoint again. Good thing our flight was early enough that we transferred before most people would get to the airport, and so there was no wait. 

Oh yeah, there was no signage in Terminal 2 to let us know that we had to do all this. And staff in the terminal did not provide clear instructions on what we had to do.",November 2018,"December 4, 2018",4.0,,,,,,,,
Travelling With Kid,Kuala Lumpur,Seoul,North Asia,"The Goods:

Cleanliness (From KUL & from ICN) - Great for both seats and lavatory 

Flight attendants (From KUL & from ICN) - Good. Able to speak English. On my flight to KR, they even have an attendant who can speak Mandarin. Also on that flight, I witness a family traveling with infant and I see how helpful the flight attendants. As a mother, that help is greatly appreciated. Not like other airlines, the flight attendants do not INSTRUCT me to shut the window shade (Leave me clueless until today. If someone can enlighten me, please do so).

Food - Good presentation and taste. I suppose I have to rate ""excellent"" for their kids meal as my picky kiddo was able to finish up the food without any problem, and even leave me without any photos of kids meal.

The Not-So-Goods:

First class is a JOKE!,Seoul,Nadi,International,"I have heard some great things about Korean Air’s First Class experience and that is why I chose to save up my skymiles and use them for my honeymoon to take a Korean Air First class flight to Fiji.   We were so excited to have this experience as it is rare to get to fly first class for us.  

I am a frequent flier and have flown almost every airline and often fly business class for my work and I take international flights all of the time.  I have seen the First Class and dreamed of doing it and so I did.  The flights were booked, the hotel was booked and my fiancé was very excited! 

The first flight we took was actually nice.  It was a newer plane and we had a lovely experience.  My (now) wife even commented that this was the most attention she has ever received on a flight!  The service was great and the plane was also nice.   We then got to Seoul and enjoyed the First Class Lounge which was TOP NOTCH!  Truly the best lounge I have been to!  We then boarded the long flight to Nadi from Seoul and here is where massive disappointment set in. 

We got to our seats, 1A and 1B.  We looked around and the first class was IDENTICAL to business class.  Literally, the same seats.  We thought that was odd but not a big deal.  We were greeted by our flight attendant and asked what we wanted for our meals.  I had called and arranged for my wife to have a vegetarian meal as she is vegetarian.  I called about a week before the flight to make sure they had it and they confirmed they have it marked.  However, they did not have any indication when we arrived on the flight day that she was vegetarian.  I was further shocked that there was NO vegetarian option on the menu!  EVERY flight I have ever flown has a vegetarian option even in coach!  

We then asked for Champagne to celebrate our honeymoon.  They came back to us and told us the champagne was not yet chilled so it would be warm and brought us warm champagne.

When we ordered our breakfast, we both asked for the French Toast. (let me please point out that there was only ONE other person in First class) and they said they only had one French toast.  ALL of the other options were meat based or had pork (which I don’t eat) So I let her have the French Toast and I just went without breakfast since she went without dinner. 

I then ordered a glass of wine.  When I told them my preference, I was told, they did not have that one.  When I asked for a different one, yep… same answer.  They didn’t have that one either.  So I asked for a third option and you guessed it…. They didn’t have it either.  They had ONE option of red wine.  My last preference.  (See photo)

The final issue was that my seat would not lay flat.  We tried to get it to lay flat the flight attendant tried but it would not.  I even went to another seat that was empty and it would not either.  Needless to say, we felt a bit neglected and not well taken care of.  

All in all, this was NOT a first class experience and I used a LOT of my skymiles to make this happen.  I am upset that I worked so hard to make it happen and to give my wife an experience to remember and it was far from it.  We will certainly remember it but not as Korean Air would want us to….  

We sent this exact message to Korean Air directly and asked for some kind of refund on our skymiles.  They have not acknowledged the complaint or addressed it at all.  I have called and submitted it on their website comment section.  They dont seem to care.",November 2018,"December 3, 2018",1.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0
A Vegetarian on a Korean Air flight is akin to Snakes on a plane. They just don't know what to do with us.,Los Angeles,Mumbai,International,"If you are willing to spend a few thousand on a Business Class flight, Korean Air might not be your best bet, if alternatives are available. I recently flew Korean Air from Los Angeles to Mumbai on an A 380, and the experience has convinced me never to fly them, ever! Food, being one of the deepest impressions in a man, is powerful enough to make or break an experience. Being a Vegetarian and having made my dining choices amply clear to Korean Air 2 months in advance, I am pretty sure they had a big enough window to ensure that I was well taken care of. But then again, I should have heeded the warnings. The first warning came while I was waiting in the lounge. Except for a 'Pizza Margherita' there's no food for someone who doesn't want animal protein. The second came at the boarding counter. The ground staff gave me quite a condescending head to toe scan before I was admitted into the Business Class section. And I know I was well dressed. Brown skin maybe?
On board experience:
First the good. The In-Flight service is extremely polite and attentive. The stewardesses and the head purser came and introduced themselves and were very warm, and this IMO is the strongest point of flying an Asian airline. They go out of their way to ensure you're okay. Now the bad. Dinner service began almost as soon as we were air borne. First came the beverages, and after the beverages came the food. So what I got for dinner was something I was going to get for breakfast. Potato Wedges. I was shocked at this lame choice of food. Unfortunately, this was one of the first of many let downs on this flight. Korean Air has zero concept of serving a cheese board with Wine and Champagne and all you get are peanuts, in a sachet. Dessert? If fruit's your thing, then yes, but don't expect a good, well presented dessert, not even Ice Cream. And yes, there's no Cappuccino machine on board. Just plain black Folgers.
              And I can't write off this poor choice in food because it is an Asian airline. I have flown Singapore and Cathay Business and both have excellent options for Vegetarians on air and on ground. 
            The seating configuration in the Business Class section is 2-2-2. Not the best for a Long Haul flight. Fortunately, I didn't have someone next to me so I was spoilt for space. The seat itself was comfortable with a decent sized screen. But the IFE on Korean Air is so sad, that you're better off viewing something on your iPad or your laptop. The IFE remotes BTW are clunky, which really doesn't help matters. In a nutshell, unless Korean Air does a major overhaul about their IFE, seating arrangement and most importantly their food choice, I will never fly them and will never recommend them.

Weekend getaway,Hong Kong,Seoul,North Asia,"First time on Korean Air. The flight to Seoul was on a 747-800 so the cabin was newly done with everything looking fresh. I had a window seat and in that configuration it was actually a nice space (lots of legroom with a lie flat bed) with a modicum of privacy once in flight with the privacy screen up. As you have to walk into the space through your own little corridor the design offers a touch more privacy to your own seat (space). The only gripe about the configuration was that your neighbour can more or less look in on you when the screen is down - takeoff and landing. 

Service was fine but the stand out was the food and especially the Bibimbap. The starter salad was fantastic but the Bibimbap lifted the whole meal to another level. It was so good I ordered the same thing on the way back even though it was a late night (and slightly delayed) flight - sadly on an older and much smaller plane. The food was still fantastic and the stewardess very warm and friendly. 

Whilst the experience doesn’t quite compare with the Middle Eastern Airlines, Korean Air comes out very favourably compared to other biggish carriers around. The quality of the food - quite simply one of the best meals I have had on a flight from the kimchi, salad all the way through to the Bibimbap.

"Great service, but",Seoul,Bangkok,Southeast Asia,"I have to give Korean Airlines a nod to their great service and professionalism. No complaints at all. The food service is good. Flight attendants helpful and friendly. Cleanliness is always good. 
HOWEVER. 
The seats in economy are the most uncomfortable things I have ever had the displeasure to sit in. 
Very disappointing for what is supposed to be the premier long haul aircraft today. The Airbus A380. Bring back the old 747. I flew this route 3 times now and the economy seats in the A380 are like sitting on concrete. I needed to sit on my pillow for the remaining 4 hours of the flight to Bangkok and the entire 5-1/2? hour flight back.
I get the need to save weight in order to pack in as many people as possible, but we are people. NOT cattle.

I have sat in other economy seats and none were this bad. I can see for a short flight (1 or 2 hrs) it may not be too critical. But over 5 hours this is cruel and inhuman punishment for a paying customer. 

I have no choice in fare class on this connection when booking because it is done through my departure airline. The website doesn't allow me to upgrade to a better class on the partner airline.

Did not live up to reputation,Seoul,New York City,International,"I had been looking forward to this flight (this series of flights) for a long time, as Korean has always been on my bucket list of airlines to fly. The entertainment options were few for English speakers, and lacked updated moves/series. In addition, the options were exactly the same for the flights from JFK-ICN, ICN-SGN, BKK-ICN, and ICN-JFK (that's almost 40 hours of flying!!). The food was also just ok, not disappointing but also not memorable. Seat comfort was good- but I was surprised to find that not one of the aircraft we flew (747-8, A380-8, and A330) had personalized seat air, it was all centralized. All crews greeted us with a warm and friendly greeting, however, we experienced some of the same as the other reviewers: our food was served last, our trash was picked up last (leaving us with trays of trash through very turbulent sections), we were singled out to be seated when we had to go to the bathroom even though others walked RIGHT by flight attendants asking us to be seated and additional passengers were stretching in the aisles.",November 2018,"November 28, 2018",3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0

Seamless service,Brisbane,Chitose,International,"Seamless service from check-in to lounge to flight. Very professional and friendly staff.
Business class seating is comfortable but one arm rest disappears when reclining which could become a little uncomfortable for some. 
Food was good, 4 courses including entree, soup, main, dessert and fruit. Main course served in older style dishes but of good quality. Lacks the personal dining and plated meals of other carriers but considering the cost, this can be overlooked.
The Korean foods are very authentic, keep this in mind when choosing your meals.

First time flying on an A380. Great airliner for long flights.,New York City,Seoul,International,"I think this is a combination of Delta Airlines and Korean Airlines.

No complaints about the staff or service, everything seemed to be fine in that department. As for the food... well it's airline food so how good can it possibly be ;) 
The food wasn't bad, better than most airlines(economy class) I suppose.

Safe Flight Not So Awesome Experience!,Atlanta,Bangkok,International,"My husband and I flew Korean Air from Atlanta to Bangkok with a short stop in Seoul, Korea.

First let me say there is a marked difference in First Class, Business a Class (which is upstairs) and Economy. Seat space is larger than domestic flights but not what you would want for that long of a flight. The food was just so so, I am not an adventurous eater. I was so thankful we brought snacks. They also have a “schedule” they follow as far as food, when your seat backs can be back, when your shades are open and so on and so on. It was irritating.

Every other business class I've flown has served a bowl of mixed nuts, no peanuts, to go with that first drink. First impressions are important. Everything is small. Small pillow, coach class size. Small glassware with very small pours of wine, cocktails and even water! The cabin crew acted like they were paying for it themselves if you asked for another 2 ounce pour of wine. I've never seen anything like it. There were no offers of water throughout the 11 hour flight. Easy to get dehydrated flying Korean.

Pleasant with slight inconsistencies,Singapore,Toronto,International,"Korean Air is always my first choice because I like the food. You will never feel hungry in KE flights. But their service can be inconsistent. I will break down my review to 2 parts because I had 2 flights with them: 

I flew from Singapore to Toronto, with a very quick layover of 1 hour and 30 mins in Seoul. So my first flight was SIN to ICN. SIN to ICN was an overnight flight from 1 am (Singapore time) to 8 am (Korea time). I was seated at window seat as I had requested prior and it was all okay. In the morning, before landing, I had Korean porridge as I started to feel unwell. The FA was attentive and kind, and understood English well.
I spoke to one of them that I was worried that I might be late to my connecting flight because I only had 1 hour 30 minutes transit time, with the SIN-ICN flight being slightly delayed and I had to transfer gate from one end of the airport to another end. The FA kindly took my carry-on luggage, label it with some sticker and gave me a note explaining that she put my luggage at the very front of the plane and I can exit the plane from the business class exit, grab my carry-on and transfer to my connecting flight. It was a really nice gesture. I went through 2 security scanning at Incheon airport as I exit one gate and got into another gate, but I made it on time to my ICN-YYZ flight. However, ICN-YYZ flight was slightly delayed too.

Second, Seoul to Toronto was slightly disappointing. I called the customer service few days before the flight to request the seat, but they told me I can only do that at the airport (meaning when I arrived at Changi airport). But the ground crew at Changi told me that I can only request seat for SIN-ICN and not ICN-YYZ. Bear in mind that I wasn't aware about the class of my ticket because my relative was the one buying the ticket.
I ended up sitting at the aisle seat, for ±14 hour flight. They tried to make it up by sitting me at the very front row with much bigger leg room, but I don't remember having personal in-flight screen. This flight had many FA with different badges on their uniform stating that they can speak English, Korean, Chinese, or Japanese; which I think is quite interesting. But personally I feel the service was better on my SIN-ICN flight.

Nevertheless, I'm booking another flight with KE to go to Jakarta in few months, and everything seem to go smoothly. I had chosen all my seats for all my flights online and I got STPC this time. So I'm excited!",August 2018,"November 9, 2018",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0

Great airline,New York City,Seoul,International,"Flew to South Korea from New York and then back in economy. Seats were roomy enough and apparently Korean air has the least seats per design in the a380 of any commercial carrier meaning they have the most room.

Even on the short hop from Incheon to Busan, which necessitated a change in Incheon, the flights are comfortable.  A big advantage we have found is that they stick to the schedule.

I've been on other long flights where you only get one meal at the beginning and one before landing. On a 14hr flight where you don't have any snacks packed, it's brutal!

Third long haul flights with Korean Air,Seoul,Chicago,International,"This is my third time flying with Korean Air on my annual trip to China. Very fortunate to fly first class cabin with them on all three trips. Value is very good. Service was superb and very attentive. It is easier for me as I have got used to their routines and service. We flew from Beijing to Seoul with them as well and with hindsight, it was perhaps an indulgence to make this very short flight in the first class cabin. 
The food and wine selections were good - I do enjoy the caviar service with a wonderful champagne. Flying with Korean is always a pleasure. Keep up the good work.
The big change was Terminal 2 at ICN airport. The terminal is fantastic. The ground service is vastly improved and the first class lounge is soo much better than the old lounge.

Short flight done right,Seoul,Tokyo,North Asia,"My wife and I took advantage of the Korean Fall Holidays (Cheoseok?) and spent the week in Japan. We booked through Orbitz, and Korean Air provided updates on aircraft & seat changes. Flying from Korea on Korean Air Business Class provided us express security screening and lounge access before boarding. The lounge was immaculate and spacious, albeit the food was mostly Asian. Once onboard the Boeing 747-700, cabin crew greeted us and we were shown to our seats and given a menu for the meal. The meal was hot and surprisedly quite tasty for “airline food”. The flight was just at 2-hours long, but my in-flight entertainment selection overran due to PA interruptions (in 3 different languages); luckily, I was able to conclude the selection on return flight. Korean Air is a Sky Aligance partner (Delta Air) so you can collect SkyMiles with them.

Poor trained flight crews,Las Vegas,Taipei,International,"I love the korean air the fact that it only has one stop to my destination, they have superb airport, however, I feel the flight crew lack proper training in customer service.  One time the airplane wasn't able to landed on time, so it kept circling around the air till I start to feel nauseating and want to throw up, I asked the flight attendant if I can have a pain killer, she has a confused look on her face, but pretend that she knows what I""m talking about and dashed off and never come back, so in the end, I puked in the bag and felt miserable till we landed, I felt all the crews have tendency to ""pretend"" they understood what you are saying, or they gave you some kind of empty gesture making you think they will do something, but in the end they didn't do anything.  Another time, I asked if I can have a cup noodle while on flight, flight attendant told me she'll get to it, hours later, still nothing, and I had to ask another one again, now I really see how they run, they are hoping you will forget about your own request, but not me, I remember everything and which is the reason why I'm leaving the review right now.",December 2017,"November 3, 2018",2.0,4.0,3.0,,1.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0

Very good airline,Sydney,Seoul,International,"Actually I flew to Seoul, then to Prague. Flew out Vienna and then to Seoul, then Sydney.
I really liked the leg room in Economy. More than Ive noticed on others - including Qantas, JAL, Vietnam, Asiana, Singapore Malaysian, China Eastern, Thai etc., very roomy for Economy.

Liked the toothbrush, paste, slippers, excellent service. Liked the Jurlique refresheners like body lotion and toner spray in the loos.

I had gone via Asiana once before on a previous trip to Seoul, much preferred Korean Airlines. Both got sick on Asiana ( not sure if it was due to their spicy food or something we just picked up elsewhere - so not claiming it was Asianas fault) so we selected Bland meals in advance this time,  just to be on the safe side. Also works out that you get your bland meal separately, in fact, first.

On the two occasions we had breakfast we were served omelette and vegetables. Both times, there was variation in the type of vegetables, yoghurt and fruit served. Tasted fine.

For lunch and dinner meals, on various legs, we got bread rolls, fruit, a dessert, fish or chicken with vegetables etc. Bland but still tasty.

Most other travellers got so much food. Heaps of food. If not satisfied with what they received on their trays, most people had noodles afterwards also. Most people definitely went for seconds! 

Liked the inflight entertainment screen ( generous size);but the movie selection for new releases wasnt fantastic.

English language is no issue. Flight attendants were easy to understand.

HIGHWAY ROBBERY $900AUD for 2 HOUR FLIGHT,Seoul,Sydney,International,"This is the first time I have ever written a negative review, but what happened should not go forgotten and untold. If I could rate this 0/5, I definitely would. 
I’m a VERY frequent flyer and have travelled to almost every country possible. My passports are full of stamps and never have I experienced such a terrible airline that will take advantage of their poor customers. 
- What happened? 
I had booked a return flight from Tokyo to Korea. Due to my business, I had to book a business trip from Tokyo back to Australia for a few days. That meant I did not catch my flight from Tokyo to Korea as I was in Australia.
I then booked a separate one way flight from Australia to Korea. On the day of returning to Tokyo from Korea at the airport, I was told I could not use my return flight anymore. 
I was willing to forfeit my flight from Tokyo to Korea without requesting a refund from the airline, but they told me they had to reissue another ticket as my return flight that I had PAID for was no longer “valid”. 
They did not refund me my return flight, but made me pay MORE money. 
I asked them what happened to the seat I paid for and they ignored me. They literally sold my seat to someone else and made me pay for another seat. 
Or they knew I’ll have no choice but to pay for my seat again, so they kept it for me. 
This was ridiculous as I already PAID for a seat which cost $500AUD 2 hour return flight and they made me pay another $400AUD. 
They told me if I want to leave, I have to pay the fare. If I did not pay, I would not be able to go home. 
They took advantage of the situation, so I ended up paying $900AUD for a 2 hour one way ticket. 
$900 for a 2 hour flight?!!

I’ve been in countless situations such as missing flights and the airlines will just reissue another ticket for the next available flight at no additional cost. They never took advantage of the situation knowing I’ll still have to pay as I need to go home. 
Please do yourselves all a favour, trust someone who has flown with airlines from all around the world. 
Prevent any possibility of Korean Air stealing money from you, save your money- Never fly with Korean Air. 
I will never fly with Korean Air again and will be making sure I tell everyone.",October 2018,"November 2, 2018",1.0,,,,,,,,

On the way back to Singapore, we were on an older plane so the space and comfort was greatly compromised. A different crew but same young and accommodating and always with a smile.

Worst Flight of My Life,Seoul,New York City,International,"It was raining that day -- a bleak morning's harbinger to a very noir experience. 
I was fooled by this flight, advertised as DL 1003, one would think DL meant that Delta operated the flight -- I did not read the size 8 font that indicated it was operated by Korean Air. Never again will I be fooled.

Absolutely terrible boarding experience conducted at Incheon. Rude and awful attendants announced all should board and then denied it -- forcing me to the back of the line. How awful and rude -- atrocious and terribly conducted.

Onboard experience -- good grief:

-3 oz servings of everything from water to coffee. They were, quite literally, half cups of water and coffee. 

-The flight attendants were shocked that I wanted entire bottles of water. This is an international flight, I did not wish to become dehydrated and ill. 

-Two wines available: white and red. Both godawful. While I realize sitting in coach is not a Michelin star experience, Delta, KLM, Lufthansa, AirItalia and Aeroflot have always managed to maintain a standard and expectation of courteous attendants and edible food. Am I to believe that Korean Air is supposed to be at the same standard in your alliance? That idea is, quite frankly, laughable. 

-Food was absolutely atrocious. They claimed it was western style beef. Beef and potatoes, couldnt go wrong. Well, I was proven a fool yet again. Covered in some strange gravy sauce concoction. Ill to my stomach. Could not stand to eat one more thing during the flight. These flight attendants didnt want to serve their customer by not giving me anything as I politely asked, they kept insisting to give me food, only after five attempts thereafter did they get the hint I wasnt interested in being sick all over again.

-In flight entertainment: designed / vetted in 2007 just in time for my flight in 2018. Very limited film, television, and music selections. Documentaries no one cares about. All Korean based / centric. 

-Stress was always induced by these frantically running flight attendants, yes literally running, on the bounce, place to place on the aircraft. Very stressful and irritating -- could not sleep.

At the end of the day, Im pleased this flight landed me back in my native United States of America, but that is its only merit. 

If I have it my way I will never fly Korean Air again nor will I ever venture to the peninsula of Korea again in my life. 

This airline is, culturally, very different with different standards of conduct for passengers and expectations held by passengers. Avoid at all costs.

It would have been more preferable to take a boat back to the US and a long train ride.",May 2018,"October 4, 2018",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Regardless we were not allowed to continue to Bangkok even on the next day and they wouldn't even let us change our tickets to go back to the US.  Korean Air desk agents were extremely unhelpful and rude.  They would not accept any responsibility and even when the manager was called, we were given the same response (that a visa is required when clearly all the websites show that it is not) and the manager basically ran away.  We called customer service and they told us to send an email.

Great Airline!,Chicago,Denpasar,International,"We had a super long haul flight from Chicago to Bali and the service was impeccable on both flights. 

We usually do business class long haul but decided to try their economy which ended up being excellent. 

The first leg ORD to Korea was good - I wasn’t a fan though of all the lights off and mandatory closure of window covers 2 hours after takeoff... and it was midday. My children needed light to keep them awake so they could sleep on the latter part of the flight but it didn’t happen and they ended up playing up as it was basically pitch black at midday. 

The food was good for the hot food but the snack had some strange meat in it. Oh dear. 

The next flight from Korea to Bali was so good we fell asleep for the whole flight as at this stage we were up 26 hours. So we slept for 6 hours and got awoken by the lights. Arrived on time at 12.10am Bali time.

Never a Bad Experience,Bangkok,San Francisco,International,"I am a retired American expat living in Thailand. I have always flown Korean Air between the US and Thailand and have never had anything but exceptional service. Their equipment is spotless, their staff courteous, efficient, and friendly, and their attention to detail superb. 

I had one experience that solidified my loyalty to KA. On my permanent move to Thailand, my flight from Atlanta to Incheon, Korea (where I would change planes to Chiang Mai, Thailand) was delayed due to weather, causing me to miss my connection. There is only one flight daily to Chiang Mai. The attendant informed me mid-flight that they had arranged for me to catch the next day's flight. When I arrived in Incheon, I was provided with a hotel room (4-star), vouchers for three meals, limo to and from the hotel, and delayed checkout as my flight didn't depart until 6 PM local time. All of this due to a delay that was not their fault.

Contrast that with my experience with Delta when the delay of their flight due to mechanical issues caused me to miss that same connection in Incheon just a year prior. Their ""service""? A $6 meal voucher at the Atlanta airport. And U. S. based carriers wonder why they have difficulty competing with foreign carriers...",September 2018,"September 28, 2018",5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Small is not best,Brisbane,Amsterdam,International,"A  recent experience was flying with Korean air with our destination as Amsterdam. Our travel agent recommended KA as we would get a free night in a hotel in Seoul as long as there was a significant break between our flight in and our on-flight out.  The hotel, and included meals, etc, was great. 

Unfortunately, the downside is that Korean is a small airline and the flight out of Brisbane was at 8:25am which meant staying overnight in Brisbane to get to the airport in time for an international checkin, etc. so we still ended up paying for an overnighter anyhow.

The flights home.  For Amsterdam, KA flights seem to be limited to one a day so the journey home was horrendous.  We disembarked the MS Koningsdam about 8:30 local time, did a 3 hour ""transfer tour"" and were dropped off at Schiphol at midday. We then sat around with our cases until Korean opened their checkin at 18:10 for our flight at 21:20 local time and after another long transit wait at Seoul (no hotel this time) eventually got to Brisbane then drove home, arriving about midday on the following Tuesday, a typical Australian / European flight experience, I suppose, but not one I appreciated. 

With the benefit of hindsight, the specific feedback here is, ALWAYS think hard about travelling with a small airline, it is often better to pay a bit more and go with the flights that minimise waiting times and shorten the journey as much as possible.",September 2018,"September 27, 2018",3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,2.0,4.0

Soon as we got off Incheon, he was carted off to the clinic at the airport. A month later, on our trip back, they actually checked with him! They thought he still needed a wheelchair!

"Terrible service, last time with KE",Seoul,Mumbai,Asia,"Took an hour and a half before any drinks came out, when they did it was only soft drinks. I asked twice for a glass of wine, another 30 mins later I got one with the meal. Despite the tiny glasses it was obvious they didn’t want to do top ups. After 5 or 6 shots of wine they refused to serve me anymore. Apparently I looked drunk.

Can't go wrong with it,Seoul,Los Angeles,International,"I've also flown business class with United, China Air, and Lufthansa. I'd rate Korean Air above United and China Air (which was easily the worst of the 4). Only Lufthansa offered better cabin experience and menu. Movie selection was OK - not as 'rich' as with United but, unlike United, there were a few movies worth watching. Also unlike United, they also had some limited music offerings as part of the entertainment options (I really don't get it why United does not). One thing that slightly bothered me was the absence of space next to the seat to store small personal items - had to use the pocket in front of the seat. The lounge at Incheon was worse than the Lufthansa ones in Germany - United's Polaris is now the best. Lounges in Asia are generally poor. Service left nothing to complain about (United can be spotty and the Chinese airlines have certainly not mastered the concept yet).

Flying Like I Remember,Chicago,Seoul,International,"There is no way around it - it takes forever to fly to Korea. But Korean Air did everything they could to make the flight more comfortable - even in the economy section. 
The flight crew was attentive, the 2 meals we received (Yes - meals) were very good, and the flight attendants were always helping someone - even grabbing things for passengers out of the overhead bin.

Long but easy connections,Ulaanbaatar,Vientiane,Southeast Asia,"Despite a very long layover of 20 hours at Incheon (arriving from ULN at 2120 hrs and departing at 1700 hrs the following evening), the ICN airport has good facilities, including reasonably good free beds to get some sleep, if you can grab one that's empty and if you can tolerate the loud mouth transit travellers who refuse to shut up all night long and respect the privacy of other passengers wanting to get some rest. This airport needs some kind of policing to maintain the sanity of peace-loving passengers trying to get some shut-eye! 
If you are OK with most of the shops closing down at night with hardly any decent places left to grab a late snack or dinner, you can enjoy ICN airport by day. The airport is lively, has a good range of duty-free shops, interesting displays of live Korean fashion and cultural shows, regular shows of miniature robots dancing to 'Gangnam Style' and other hits by PSY, and good places to eat and drink. All these 'attractions' make long layovers somewhat tolerable.
The 5 hour flight from Incheon to Wattay Airport (Vientiane) is tolerable. There's no in-flight entertainment. Operated by Jin Air (code sharing with Korean Air), the flight is a minimal budget-type service with poor food and drink. Moreover, you would need to struggle to get the attention of the cabin crew for an extra cup of water and, when they are not serving the meal, you are practically left to fend for yourself. Most other options to get from Mongolia into Laos are via China and best avoided.

Not a huge selection of western movies but OK(I watched 'Ready player one'). The hostesses have basic english, food was OK.

"KA PROVIDES NOTHING WHEN FLIGHT DELAYS FOR 48 HOURS, VERY BAD!!!!",Bangkok,Ulaanbaatar,Asia,"My connecting flight with Korean Air to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia was canceled yesterday (Sep 19, 2018) due to the weather condition at the destination. Today it was canceled again (Sep 20, 2018). I am the airport for 24h so far and expected to wait another 24h as I write this review at 4:38pm on Sep 20th, 2018. I talked to the airlines transfer disk and site manager since yesterday and this whole morning and afternoon. I was provided with ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, no food or accommodation and can't even move between the terminals. I don't have a visa to Korea so I can't leave the airport. 

After making uncomfortable arguments for hours with Mr. Park, manager of Terminal 2 Level 4 Transit Lounge site manager Mr. Park, I was given 1 bottle of water and in-flight blanket. KOREAN AIR SUCKED AT ALL MEANS HANDLING MY SITUATION. I was told that the company policy takes no liability over flights get canceled because of the weather and further I was told that the weather was my country's (destination) problem but NOT THE AIRLINES'S. This is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE and UNPROFESSIONAL of the KOREAN AIR. Contrary to the common belief that it is one of the best airlines, Korean Air delivers NO SERVICES, NOTHING THEY PROMISE OR ADVERTISE. I am extremely disappointed and will never fly with this airlines again. There are 11 fellow passengers who were supposed to fly together gathered at the terminal 2, some have been at the airport already 34h. Four people out of the group were given accommodation and food vouchers last night (Sep 19, 2018) for the reason that their flight has longer transit hours. It is really IRONIC and ""FUNNY"" when all of us are at the airport at least 24hours.

Great with a big but,Tokyo,Las Vegas,International,"This flight was cheaper than the National Japanese carriers or even the American ones but it was an extremely long day. My flight over was fine arriving just after I left (even though it was via Korea) due to the crazy time difference. Food and seat comfort were fine but the movies lacked a little spark. Enough to keep me interested but only just. A lot of third rate movies as fillers. 
Returning to Japan we had to check out from our AirBnB around ten and my friends were leaving so I thought I would just go out to the airport and cruises. Big mistake.Korean Air's flight didn't leave until 11.30pm and there was nowhere to check in until three hours before the flight. There was also only a small Starbucks and that was it for food and entertainment. After 8 hours my desk opened and I went through. On top of the long wait  an 11 hour flight to Korea / a five hour lay over in Seoul and 2½ hours back to Tokyo. So all in all I was awake for 40 hours. None of this is the airline's fault of course but I think the 11.30 flight is their only one so find another place to leave luggage and spend another day on the strip!

Korean Air delivered the same on time performance, however I was treated with a much higher level of personal service and respect. I work for an airline but I choose to buy tickets like everyone else when I travel because I don't want to deal with the disrespect and hassles of standby travel.

In Business class, you are not allowed to change or select your seat unless you are a Korean Air SKYPASS member, which is a the strangest rule I have come across on a full fair airline.  Flying in middle seat on long haul on angle flat, while paying very expensive KE fare, is never a fun experience.    The food and wine quality is also below average the food service is very slow.

👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼,New York City,Seoul,International,"It was my first time to travel via Korean Airlines . I
decided to do a side trip to Korea before heading to Manila for my aunt’s centennial birthday celebration.
I was very pleased with the food they served throughout  the round trip from JFK- Seoul- Manila and back .
Two weeks before my flight, I called to request seafood meal since I’m a pescetarian. Korean not only provided very good seafood meals but I was served earlier from the rest of the passengers . I was very impressed !!!

The only reason why I gave a 4 thumbs and not 5 is because their entertainment system was not as good compared to another airline, which I use quite frequently for international flights. There were not a lot of movie selections. I would suggest to improve this especially since it is a good 14 hours to travel from US-Korea or vice versa. 

Another thing I would suggest is maybe they can also provide  services from Newark, NJ since I live too far from JFK. I’m sure NJ travelers will agree. 

Otherwise, Korean Air is definitely one of the best airlines I have ever used and I will highly recommend it.

BEWARE,Beijing,Seoul,North Asia,"First of all: great in-flight service, very spacious, clean and confortable aircfafts. 
However, if your ticket is booked and payed by a third person, or even travel agency, you may be in trouble. In check-in, they will confirm if you can present the credit card that was used to pay the ticket. If not (you booked through a travel agency that made your reservations in Korean Air website, or if someone gave you the tickets as a gift, or if you bought the tickets to your son that is studying abroad, etc) they will not let you travel. We were not allowed to embark in Beijing, although we had the tickets paid, because the credit card that was used was from a travel agency. We had to pay for the tickets again, paying twice for the same tickets!!! Fortunately we had credit cards with us (not all portugueses have one!!!), and we had credit on it. Moreover, it was sunday, so it would be impossible to solve anything with the travel agency. And we do not have any Korean Air Branch in Portugal.
It is true that this information is on the small letters of the 10 (or more) pages of your Ticket Fare information, but it should be present (highlighted) when you are paying your tickets online.
We will get the refund of the tickets, but all the process should be automatic (if the first tickets were cancelled, the refund should be made to the credit card immediatelly) - but it doesn't work like that, we must solve it on the phone from Portugal.
So, whenever travelling with Korean Air, beware of the credit card that was used to pay for the tickets.",August 2018,"September 12, 2018",1.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,4.0

Departure from Hong Kong, the lounge was great as usual. 
Transit in Seoul, the lounge is one of the best in Asia. There are a lots of free activities at the airport for the kids or if you had enough time, you can join their day tour.

Cabin was clean, well layout and quite new. Comfortable. 

Entire trip 4 sectors were great flight experience. Cabin crews served with passion, professional. Unlike some other airlines served by fake smile.   

If I travel again to Korea or via Korea, I would definitely choose Korean Air.

Limited entertainment though, they should offer more movies. And, I hate the baggage restriction. For the price I pay, should be able to get more than 1x23kg! And when you need to buy extra baggage, the cost will be very expensive. Certainly will be a problem when traveling on winter for me.

Stewardesses have the personality of stones.,Atlanta,Seoul,International,"The stewardesses act like they are angry all the time and I suspect that they do this so that a passenger won't ask for any assistance. The stewardesses sit in the back of the plane conversing with one another and only come out two times in a 13 hour flight (Atlanta to Seoul). This attitude makes flying on Korean Airlines a giant pain in the rear end. Even though these ladies are attractive, they seem to have the personality of a bowling ball. They have zero sense of humor, they make no attempt to chat with anyone, and most of the time they spend their time complaining to passengers about completely trivial issues. When our plane stopped in Seoul,l I expected Kim Jong Un to come out of the cockpit to introduce himself. These ladies are really tough cookies and they appear to have been trained by the North Korean Army. I would not want to meet any of these ladies on a dark and lonely street. On our flight, there was one Stewardess from Thailand and she was a delight to speak with. No one asked her for anything special, but she kept a smile on her face and a positive attitude. Maybe they should fire all the stone-faced Koreans and go on a recruiting trip to Thailand. Also, Delta Airlines has some kind of business relationship with Korean Airlines. In my opinion, the nasty attitude of the flight attendants should be secretly evaluated by Delta (Delta is a very nice airline) and see if I am speaking dishonestly.

Once onboard the flight crew was helpful and professional throughout the flight and seemed to be genuinely concerned about whether or not I comfortable and what I thought of the cuisine.  The inflight entertainment system was adequate and there was a good number of movie choices. The best part of this experience was the amount of space the passengers have in business class.

rip off airline when it's their system fault,Tampa,Ho Chi Minh City,International,"Just cancel one of the passenger ticket due to the one of the middle name was missing becaus when my father he book the ticket for me at that time my skypass account middle name wasn't updated yet. And he  book the ticket with a missing middle name, and called in to Korean air ask to have middle name added to the reservation and the told me to call delta since because I'm going to fly out through them first from TPA to JFK. After delta inform me that they cant' do anything because I booked through Korean air, which mean korean air are the only one that are able to update the name on the ticket. Make many phone call Korean air is an rip-off company when your system should be updated with my full middle name on my ticket. After go back and forth Korean won't waive or atleast waive half of the penalty. I'm really surprise this is how rated #1 airline in the world. I think the media should be aware of how RIP OFF Korean air is in 2018!!!!!!!!!!! not willing to work with their customer when it's the the only middle name issue when their system should have updated when it is being change. Korean air can keep my $300 but will get a bad name and bad reputuation in 2018. Just can't believe how blind the consumer are when them are being voted the best airline. Have a good day!!!!!!!!!!

my travel date will be march 2019 and they wont do anything to help beside telling me ""oh you just have to cancel the rsvp and pay the fee and book another rsvp then you should be fine)",September 2018,"September 3, 2018",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Awesome airline,Sydney,Zurich,International,"We were a bit skeptical when we first booked to fly with Korean air but what an experience.

The ground staff at Sydney airport was courteous and friendly. We got to the airport earlier so there were no rush yet.

When we got an airplane the stewardess were friendly and attentive. They provided you with a care package consisted of tooth brushes, tooth paste, eyes masked and slippers. 

Food was awesome. In fact I don't think I ever say this but it probably offers the best food! From Sydney to Zurich, passengers had 3 choices to choose from. I tried the Bimbibap and it was really good. They then served a 2nd meal 2 hours before arrival and out of the 3 choices again, I had the seafood noodles. It's an 11 hours flight for Sydney so if you get hungry in between meals, you can ask for cup noodles. You know how good Korean cup noodles is! :)

Entertainment wise you will have enough selections to keep you occupied for hours. I watched 3 movies like The quite place, Rampage and Life is a party. 

Will I fly Korean air again? A definite yes!!",,"September 1, 2018",5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,
Surprisingly good!,Manila,Seattle,International,"I took Korean Air last July from MNL to SEA, at first I was skeptical as my first experience with them was not so good. I was expecting an old aircraft, indifferent crews and not so good food. But when I boarded my last flight with them, I was Impressed with the huge Improvement. Their aircraft is newly updated and i’d say better than Delta as it is closed to being a suite.

The seats are fully flat and spacious, the entertainment choices are also great. The food options are pretty diverse that you’ll have a hard time which one to order. The fare for business class is also reasonable.

The only missing, which I enjoy with Delta is the wifi.

However, I already booked my next flight with Korean air on the same route and looking forward to the same or better experience.",September 2018,"September 1, 2018",4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,
"Going downhill, missed communication",Pittsburgh,Bangkok,International,"*Pitts-JFK-Korea-BKK *
I spoke English to a couple of senior male flight attendants. They spoke Korean back to me. I'm an Asian American, not Korean- American. I felt like they were too arrogant to serve Asian female passengers. I tried to catch what the guy said about the food choices. I got some kind of pasta with some sauce. I should call it ""rubber' instead. The foods on the flight from JFK to Incheon were terrible. I expected more from Korean Air.  Korean Air and Delta Air are alliance, so I booked a flight from Pitts to JFK by Korean Air that was operated by Delta Air. Before I flew, I chat with an assistant of Korean Air if I could check in through to BKK. I was shocked he said I had to check in again at JFK. I had 2 hours overlap. I was afraid we might not have got a good seat.  The agency that I bought the tickets from recommended me to reserve my seat and my kid's seat on Korean Air app. So I did and it was very convenient for this part. At the Pitts airport, I checked in at the Delta counter. I asked the service agent of Delta if I could have checked through all our baggage to BKK. She said we had to pick up the baggage when we arrived at JFK and check them in again at Delta service. Are you kidding me? She also said there was a shuttle bus from terminal 4 to terminal 1 and we did not have to pass TSSA again. WRONG INFO!! My kid and I waited for our baggage at the terminal 4 but we could not find them. We asked someone at the Delta service counter. The agent said the baggage had been checked through to BKK and we did not have to check them in again. OMG! We were so mad at the Delta agent at Pitts airport that told us wrong info!! We had to take the air train from terminal 4 to terminal 1 and we passed TSSA again because we were flying an international flight and basically they are different terminals. When we arrived at BKK airport. An assistant from Korean Air helped us get our baggage from the belt and push the cart and made sure we had someone to pick us up or could get a taxi for us. (this is the best part). 
*BKK-Korea-JFK-Pitts*  At JFK they let kids who were younger than 12 could get on board first. But at Incheon, I asked an agent if my kid could get on board with other kids. He said the kids have to be younger than 2 years old. What is exactly the rule? We were confused. The same male agent raised his voice at me when I showed my passport and the boarding pass to a female agent before him. What the heck!! I felt so irritated the way some male flight attendants treating female flight attendants likes they are far superior to them. The best service of Korean Air is from female flight attendants. They are super sweet and smart.  But some male flight attendants are disrespectful.

Good value,Hong Kong,San Francisco,International,"Korean Airline - prestige class

I flew from HK via Seoul to San Francisco then from Los Angeles (A380) stop over Seoul for 7 days before going back to HK.

Review on the 2 long haul.  The seat layout was a bit strange to me as there was not much privacy compared to CX which is the airline I normally flew.  However, their seats were more spacious. Insufficient storage space for business class.

The duty free shop and bar on their A380 were really cool!

One thing I really did not like was the temperature during their flight was high and I sweated, whereas normally I needed blanket.  

The service was attentive. The purser greeted every passenger.  Luckily the A380 is not full, else it must be a very tiring job for her.

Drink quality was below average (very watery champagne and cheap wine). Meal quality fluctuated. The food quality from Seoul to San Francisco was excellent. I ordered steak and it was cooked to medium rare per my request. I tried their snack Korean Ramen and they cooked it very well and i knew it was not cup noodles. The seafood soup before landing tasted very good. However, the meals and snack for the flight from LA to Seoul was so poor I gave up after a few bites.

Their price was competitive and if it remained so, I would fly Korean Airline for long haul even their Prestige lounges were really boring.",August 2018,"August 30, 2018",3.0,,,,,,,,

"Courteous, Kind and Highly Professional",Los Angeles,Manila,International,"My wife and I have been  Delta frequent flyers for  many years.  There partner is Korean Air. I have flown Korean Air 2 times over the last few years and thought they were really good. The key to a good flight is to find flights with  a short lay over in Incheon Korea. The flight from LAX was on time and all went smoothly. The food was good. The service was very good.  The seats were oh so average :(  We Landed at Incheon at about 4:30 AM with a 3 1/2 hour layover before departing to Manila. As we are about to board the flight they announce a delay of 3 hours. Oh well what one can you do. So we search for a comfortable place to relax in the transfer lounge. Unfortunately there were no lounge  chair available. We like others had to sit at the snack bar.  As we are awaiting the boarding announcement we are informed of a second 3 hour delay. Not the news we were looking for. It was at that stage when the staff announced that meal vouchers were being issued to all passengers. While we were enjoying our lunch we found out that the reason for the flight delays was due to a runway mishap at Manila international airport (NAIA).  A plane landing in manila had a hard landing in the rain and both the plane and runway were damaged and were undergoing repairs. Luckily no injuries to any passengers. Our Flight was again delayed and we were scheduled to depart 8PM. With hours to go Korea air and staff had to deal with hundreds of passengers most who were already exhausted, cranky and considering all options. An hour later dinner vouchers were handed out. With hours to go we walked the duty free shops and then went to the transfer lounge area where there are many lounge chairs for passengers to rest and stretch out before there flights. A couple of hours later Korea Air announces the cancelation of our flight to Manila. The staff at the transfer lounge were bombarded by about 100 passengers. The staff were very understanding of our mixed emotions of what we were all facing and again where we would eat and sleep for the night. After much apology they announced they would put us up at a hotel and provide dinner as well. They were doing the right thing. They were respecting the rights of all passengers even though the delays and eventual cancellation was not the fault of Korean air.They apologized again and again. They treated us all so well. It took about 2 hours to finally board a bus and make it to our hotel the Western Grace.  It was a nice hotel. It was  very clean and the room was comfortable. A nice buffet dinner was awaiting. We enjoyed the comfort food and went right to bed. Buses would be picking us up at 4:30 AM for our departing flight at 7 AM. Upon waking up and meeting up in the lobby at 4;15 we were told our flight was pushed back to 9 AM.  Drats!!.  Oh well what can you do.We need to stay optimistic.  We got to the airport, through customs  and were eager to board. About 30 passengers in our group got there boarding passes and went through screening and to the gate.  We on the other hand got to the check in agent and were told no more boarding passes were being issued.  Everything is on hold as manila is repairing the runway. :(  The agents were very nice.  They gave us another meal voucher and told us to check back in an hour.  We were stuck and decided to have coffee. Afterwards we went back to the ticketing agent and were  informed the repair work in manila was not successful and the flight was again delayed till 2PM. .  More apologies from Korean Air staff. At this stage there were many pissed off customers. Gotta say it was to no fault of the airlines but throughout they did there very best to accommodate passengers who wanted to change flights. change airlines, change routes and the rest. They were very professional and courteous and never lost there focus. I take my hat off to them all. Out come the meal vouchers and again ..wash...rinse...repeat. 2 o'clock rolls around and we boarded the flight. My 3 hour layover turned out to be 30 hours. We took off an hour later and as we landed in Manila passengers cheered and clapped. I was never so happy to hit ground. I can again say that the Korean Air staff were outstanding. A five star performance. I and my wife were very impressed on how professional, kind and cool under pressure they were.",August 2018,"August 26, 2018",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

I had a 1.5 hour layover in Inchon, Korea to transfer planes, but the connecting gate was really close.

Price:  Korean Air was on par with the rest of big name airlines that fly from HNL to HAN.  I purchased my ticket one week before flight and didn’t have any issues.   The main reason why I chose the flight was price and it was the shortest flight time.   

Cabin:  I was very comfortable with my window seats.   They had enough legroom for me to stretch my legs out.   Something you can’t say about all airline’s economy seating.  Headphones, pillow, blanket, and sandals provided.  Individual TV provided numerous movies and TV shows to choose from.  I watched Ready Player One, Avengers, and Tomb Raider.  

Service:   All the flight attendants were exceptionally nice and attentive to passengers.  Event those of us who were in Economy class.  It really was a delight.

Timeliness:  All flights departed/arrived on time.  

Meals/Snacks:   The meals were good for their purpose.   They served three meals and a couple snacks throughout the flights.  I did not pay for upgraded meals, so my options were beef with noodles or chicken and rice.

WORST AIRLINE IN THE WORLD!!!!,New York City,Seoul,International,"Email to Korean Air:
As a first time potential customer for Korean Air after flying on many numerous major airlines such as Emirates, Delta, American Airlines, ANA & Cathay Pacific. I decided to give Korean Air a try. 
Booking Reference: XXXXXX
I have never been treated so disrespectful on my telephone call to 800-438-5000 on 8/9/18 8:38PM EST with Sally and Fahad (Supervisor).
Sally tries to over talk me through the phone and hearing her frustration in explaining to me. Sally talks very loudly to me over the phone at a point she is almost yelling. We were basically having a yelling and argument over the phone. I requested a Supervisor immediately.  Fahad (Supervisor) on the other hand seemed to have more patience but could not care about the issue and definitely did not value me as a customer.
Please see attached PDF of the screen shot of the issue we were discussion. I booked an Economy ticket online and your website did not state under fare conditions that ""Advance Seat Selection"" is not available on my current ticket class.  Sally and Fahad told me on their screen it says that ""Advance Seat Selection is not available"" as we both walk through together on the koreanair.com website. They told me to email engsupervisor@koreanair.… to resolve this issue.
This issue has happened to me before with Emirates and their customer service immediately corrected my ticket and accommodated my advance seat selection for free on the telephone call. I am sad for Korean Air this could not be simply done for the customer over the phone and leaving the customer helpless from Korean Air.  Sally and Fahad repeatedly told me to just cancel the ticket from Korean Air as it is free of charge and money will be refunded to me.  To me, that is telling me and all future customers that Korean Air does not need your business. As a result, I have cancelled my reservation under the circumstances given above.
I hope you can resolve this issue and see to it that customer service needs to improve and your website needs to be corrected as discussed above. 
I also hope that your customer service can give a free courtesy advance seat selection on my itinerary when I re-book my ticket to recognize the error on your website as shown my attached PDF of the screen shot that it does not state advance seating is not available on my ticket.
I can be reached at XXXXXX to discuss this matter further. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Kindly note that for certain fares advance seat assignment is not available due to the fare restriction and seat assignment request for these fares can only be done at the check-in counter on the day of the flight departure or during web check-in. For online ticket purchase, this information is highlighted on the fare conditions section as shown in the below screenshot for your reference.
Please be advised that there is currently no error with our website and the reason you were not prompted that advance seating is not available for the fare you chose as shown in your screenshot is because advance seating is permitted for that fare. We would also like to highlight that the fare you purchased originally was a different fare as we have highlighted in the above screenshot for your perusal, this can also be further explained by the difference in the fare price as also shown in the screenshot attached to your original email. We hope this clarifies, your inquiry. 

My email response:
At the time of my original booking reference your highlighted ""advance seating selection  -  not permitted"" was not shown. Reference my screen shot pdf on my original email.
Your website was fixed 40 mins later after my call to Sally / Fahad. Or 10 mins later after my original email to engsupervisor@koreanair.….

Email response from Korean Air:
Please be advised that the screenshot you sent to us shows that the booking was made on a U fare which has no restrictions on advanced seating. However, your original booking with reference number:8130-7673 was booked on the N fare and based on the fare conditions advanced seating is not available which was the reason we were unable to assist you with the advanced seating request.

Korean Airline have been a waste of my time. Very poor customer service. I have never experienced this before from any airlines that I have flown.

KE122 SYD/ICN business in August 2018,Sydney,Seoul,International,"Flew KE122 from SYD to ICN in business in August 2018.  Skyteam Lounge at SYD wasn't too crowded.  Breakfast options were relatively limited, but not too bad.  Free Wi-Fi was available.  KE122 was A330-300, 2-2-2 configuration.  Although Seatguru says it's couple seats, it's all aisle access.  So the best seat would be window seats with more privacy.  On board breakfast was just okay.  Ramen noodle snack was really spicy.  If you don't like spicy foods, don't try it.  For lunch, I chose beef tenderloin.  Although the CA asked if medium was okay, the meat was well done and chewy.  I only had just a couple of bites, as it wasn't good.  Overall quality of food was mediocre at best.  Seat was wide/long enough, and entertainment was good.  No air matress like JL flights.  Even AABA supply thick enough seat cover to sleep on nowadays.  In addition to the blanket, KE should consider supplying that.  Overall it's just average Business class.  Going forward, I would fly KE only if the fare is significantly lower than Oneworld flights such as AA, BA, CX, JL, QR.",August 2018,"August 10, 2018",4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0

Horrible Customer Service,Houston,Bangkok,International,"We booked a flight from Houston to Bangkok. The first leg of our trip was rescheduled by the airlines and they put us on a flight that landed AFTER our connecting flight took off. They never notified us and when we finally found out and asked them to put us on a flight that would land before our connecting flight they said they couldn’t help since American Airlines was the provider of the first flight (supposedly they are part of an airline alliance). After hours on the phone with both KE and AA they just blame each other and no one will fix the issue. We have asked for a refund since we are at an impasse (which is not our fault and we have no power to fix) and KE said we have to pay the $300/person fee to cancel. So we book a flight for about $900, they change our itinerary so that it is impossible to get to our destination, they won’t correct this mistake, and they want us to pay $600 in fees to cancel???

Great Food Service in First Class!,Seoul,Bangkok,Southeast Asia,"The food service and selection in first class on this airline is first rate.  3-4 different entree choices, each with different choices for the accompanying courses.  There were 8 seats in first class and 2 attendants on my last flight, so attentiveness was superb also.  

One complaint is the difficulty in getting the VERY small monitors in place.  Almost not worth the effort.  Everyone had to ask an attendant to help them.  They need to update their seating to align with other major carriers for long distance flights and provide individual cubicles.  There was plenty of room for this in the first class cabin.",June 2018,"August 8, 2018",4.0,,,,,,,,

Most Amazing Economy Class for Amenities and Service,New York City,Seoul,International,"Albeit, I am an international novice flier but, when one is used to American domestic travel, one cannot helped be wowed by Korean Air.  I dreaded the 14 hour flight from NY to Seoul and was really concerned about how my kids would handle the duration, boredom and food but the whole family, even my youngest 9 year old, was very pleased.  Before we took off, a stewardess even showed up with kid headphones and a toy for my son which he cherishes today.  It's a nice touch that every seat has a bottle of Jeju spring water, headphones, blanket and slippers to greet you.  The food was as good as airline food can be (especially the Korean dishes like bibimbap) and my son loved his kids' hamburger platter.  The service was friendly and attentive without being disruptive especially when trying to catch some sleep.

Most space by a mile (nearly) but service could be better.,Sydney,Amsterdam,International,"We flew from Sydney to Seoul, Seoul to Amsterdam, London to Seoul and Seoul back to Sydney with Korean Airlines. We sat in what Korean Airlines call ""New Economy"" (which is the ""standard"" or base fare).

There were two things that stood out for me on all above mentioned flights, one positive and one negative:

1) The legroom / space is very significantly more than anything any airline I've flown with provides (short of business class.... which I don't fly with anyway). When using certain other airlines you can upgrade to ""Economy plus"" or whatever it's called that offers similar space that Korean Airlines provides as standard. This makes a large difference during long haul flights.

2) The staff while fairly accommodating is not nearly as friendly as from other carriers. One woman got up from her seat while the plane was still taxiing after having landed and - while I understand this might be ""dangerous"" and must be very frustrating for the staff that has pointed out a hundred times to remain seated with the seat belts engaged - she was abruptly told to sit down and was asked if she could not read the sign. Especially the latter came across rather rude especially to a customer that spent several hundreds or potentially thousands of $ for a ticket. 
If Korean Airlines staff would mimic KLM or Singapore Airlines staff a little bit (who I find without exception to be very friendly and helpful) I would never fly anything else again.",July 2018,"August 6, 2018",4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0

Too much time to spend in transit but good flights,Frankfurt,Brisbane,International,"Having to travel from Munich via Frankfurt, Seoul to Brisbane is a ‘timely No No’. Whilst there is a great airline sponsored overnight complimentary stay on the outbound flight in Seoul, the time spent to get to MUC is just prohibitive for both legs. You are substantially jetlaged arriving in OZ, after a transit of some 8 hours. There are better trips and nothing is beating Singaporeair on that sector, most certainly not Emirates either!
Re all flights, the service is consistently good and friendly, food quite ok, 2 ‘western selections and one Korean Bi Bim Bap, removal of trays slow, but crew dependant. Lights on min. of 2.5 hours prior to landing quite unacceptable, but easy for the crew, better customer focus required.
The drinks selection is poor, e.g. beer: only Korean and US’s Budweiser is extremely poor, wine very small servings, one has to ask again and again.
The entertainment selection is a very poor cousin of SQ and for these long flights not good enough.
Its is surprising for me that Korean has such bad advisors or none at all to compare.
The Korean website is very bad, suggest they borrow marketing advice from Hyundai, Kea or SQ for their customer focus.
To be fair, flying from FRA to Seol would be quite a good selection with Korean. Pricing very competitive, but only 23kg luggage allowance, little more on hand luggage. And last not least on all legs Korean was very punctual.",July 2018,"August 4, 2018",4.0,,,,,,,,
Smooth and easy,Seoul,Los Angeles,International,"I’ve been on many transoceanic flights in recent years and think this one ranked up there with the best. Why? What about it put Korean Air so high up for me? The food was good - on the 11-hour flight they fed us 2 full meals and a snack, as well as all we wanted to drink. The bathrooms were kept clean by the flight attendants. The eye mask was of better quality than some I’ve gotten on long flights, although I had to ask for one and it wasn’t just automatically given. The entertainment options were not bad, although I think they could have done a little bit better with the sitcom options. Also, the flight attendants’ service was impeccable. All of this is standard for these long flights, though, so what made this one stand out? It was the camera on the tail, belly and nose of the plane from which we could see what was happening outside at any time and from any of those angles. This was totally new to me and absolutely fascinating. Watching takeoff and landing took on a whole new dimension for me, and I found these camera views even more fascinating than the view out the actual airplane window.

First, check-in staff claimed to be unable to seat my family together, even though there were many empty seats on the SFO-ICN flight. Next, on the ICN-Vietnam leg, flight attendants refused to let my son (who wasn't feeling well) sit next to me for a few minutes in an empty seat in an exit row, on grounds that children aren't allowed in exit rows - even though this was the middle of the flight, not takeoff and landing. Negotiation got nowhere, they are bound by the rules, unfeeling and sexist, telling me that my wife should take care of a sick child and not me.

Fabulous airline - a couple tips...,New York City,Seoul,International,"Korean Air is absolutely wonderful.  They are well-staffed, very nice, and incredibly efficient.  Check-in was great.  On the flight, they give you just about everything you need (a couple additional suggestions below), including headphones, a blanket (which I recommend you sit on, more on that later), a pillow, toothbrush/toothpaste, bottle of water (still bring lots more of your own!), etc.  The in-flight entertainment options are extensive, including children’s programming and games with a controller.  

The food is also very good.  And they are good about feeding you twice on the very long overseas flights.  They offer free wine with meals as well.  A couple notes: bring lots of water as I noticed they don’t come through super often with that and/or you might be sleeping.  Also I wished they came through with smaller snacks more.

The seats are not that comfortable.  There is not a lot of padding.  I sat on my blanket and often used my pillow for my back.  If I flew another 14+ hour flight with them, I’d probably bring an inflatable donut, I’m not even kidding.  Since I often used my pillow for my back, my inflatable neck pillow came in very handy.  

Final suggestion: we brought hand-held, battery-operated fans for the flight home because the flight there was SO stiflingly hot for about 4-5 hours (I’ve seen other complaints online about this as well).  I would dress very lightly (shorts/tank) and bring a fan/cooling towel/etc.

The only unsatisfactory part was at the Incheon Airport. At the terminal 2 which was opened early 2018 and provides servcie to Korean Air, Air France, KLM and Delta only (key skyteam members), there are entirely closed section for check-in counters of the business class. The person who worked at the check in counter seemed to have long day of work. I could not seemed to get any soul in her speaking and reception was not really satisfying.

"A Wonderful Experience!!! ..... Kamsahamnida, KAL!!!",Honolulu,Seoul,International,"Not being a worldly traveler, I really don’t have much experience flying on global carriers or international airlines.  However, I did have the opportunity to fly with Korean Airlines (KAL) on a business trip to Seoul, South Korea earlier this year.  After flying in their Prestige Class, I would find it hard to imagine that another airline carrier could top what I experienced with KAL.

From the minute you step foot onto the airplane until the time you get off at your destination, you receive nothing short of “world class” treatment.  Everything is done in a very professional manner and with such class that the flight itself becomes an experience you won’t want to forget.  The flight attendants are all so very beautiful and grace you with their pleasant personality that just makes your flight time feel so short.  Always so welcoming and always wanting to serve your needs in such a courteous manner that makes you feel like royalty.

The meals being offered during the flight includes some of the most traditional Korean dishes that one would find as authentic as the meals served at any restaurant on land.  My favorite was the Bi Bim Bap as I had that both going to Seoul and returning back home.  Top that off with their wine and cheese selection and it’s almost like being at a very fancy restaurant.  Trust me, you will never be disappointed and never be hungry stepping off the airplane.

An in-flight amenity bag will take care of all your personal needs and the individual flight cabins that you are seated in gives you enough privacy to make you feel almost like being at home in your own bedroom.

Mrs,London,Osaka,International,"I rang the airline today to warn them of my son’s peanut allergy. First I spoke to call handler who point blank refused to make any provision of food on a flight that is over 15hrs. I then spoke to the manager who pointed me to a policy on their website stating they cannot guarantee peanut free food. I was asked to pack food from home for him. Having booked business class and particularly for such a long flight I think this  is disgraceful , to the point of being discriminatory. In today’s age of equal opportunities this should not be allowed. They also said we cannot guarantee peanut free environment. If a person has a reaction by smelling peanuts rather than eating they certainly will not be able to travel.

They do offer a stopover service (if you apply) in Korea as they do not have a connecting flight to LDN the same day and this is an absolute godsend with two young children.

Korean Air - Great Airline,Hong Kong,Phoenix,International,"We flew as a family of 4 on Korean Air from HK to LA (thereafter to Phoenix, AZ) and returned from Hawaii to HK. There was a layover at Incheon both ways which wasn’t long. If anyone has ever traveled for 24 hours across the globe, they know what it is to be grateful for fantastic service and quality! We were not disappointed - KA had all the necessary ingredients: competitive price, fantastic aircrafts (Boeing747, A380 etc); good service (the staff were absolutely polite and helpful); great quality (food service, movie selection, flight time management). 

The Biz class section stretched the entire length of the plane so there were many to serve but service was top notch and consistently good. (See my review on American Airlines First class service which was horrific). The seats were fully equipped with latest WiFi, touch screen systems and lighting. We had an opportunity to be on the fast track lanes at immigration which was v helpful in the busy summer period. 

The beef entree (international offering) was good and the range of alcohol was generous. We had a Bar on the A380 which kept my husband and many others v. happy. 

The seats could be a little more plush in sleep mode (I’m a side sleeper and there was not much cushion) but it was not a big issue as it did stretch out flat.

The bathrooms were clean and well stocked with a lovely bottle of liquid soap and a luxurious moisturiser.

I think that our section was about 90% full. The leg room is about 12 inches, way more than the other dedicated airline that we fly. There were no extra charges for the back-of-the-seat screen entertainment and the headphones, like other airlines may charge.  USB and 110v ports allow for charging even in the back cabin. As usual, the restrooms were well monitored and especially clean when I need to go. What I pointed out to my son was how the staff was actively walking the aisles and not just disappeared somewhere. The call-lights around us,even when accidentally pressed, were answered very quickly! And at times it wasn’t even by our regular steward/ess.

Coming back we flew AA to Korea then Korean Airlines (KAL) on the last leg to Cebu. I was surprised when the Flight Attendant stated ""Nothing can ever be plugged into their seat powerports"".

They responded quickly after just a couple days saying the Flight Attendants Response was correct and they recommended I bring enough back up batteries for all my electrical needs for 150% of their flight times!

Korean air sucks,Singapore,Seoul,North Asia,"Due to timing concern, we booked Korean Air fir our holidays. 2 days prior to check in, we were informed we cannot do online check in as need to verify our credit card details before we can do mobile check in. We booked n paid for our tickets since Feb n we are traveling in May. Why verify details after they have already charged us? This made us lose a chance to check in together n seat together as a group of 8!! 
When we return from Seoul, we were told our check in luggage cannot be more than 23kg. After which will be charged USD100 per second piece, irregardless of weight. But hand-carry can be 12 kg! Isn’t this ridiculous?? Most airlines now accept 30kg with unlimited pieces n hand-carry weight 7 kg. This makes more sense than asking passenger to carry a 12 kg load into cabin isn’t it?

Great way to break up the long haul,Sydney,Paris,International,"We fly to either Paris or London from Sydney every year. Over the past five years we've learned a lot to make our flight more comfortable. By far the best change we've made is to fly Korean Air via Seoul. The flight leaves early in the morning Sydney time and arrives in the afternoon Seoul time. The airline provides a night in a lovely 4star hotel (they provide bus transfer - 15 minutes or so), fantastic buffet dinner, luxury room with large modern bathroom, buffet breakfast if the flight doesn't leave too early. After a sound and very comfy night's sleep they transfer you back to the airport for the next leg, arriving Paris or London in the afternoon.
Your body clock is not affected as you've travelled a day, slept and travelled another day. No jetlag!
The staff are friendly, the movies are good, the food is ok.

Unfortunately it doesn't work the same way going back to Sydney, but you can choose to pay a bit extra for a sleepover.

Below average experience all around,Seoul,New York City,International,"I took a total of 4 flights from Korean air during the early months of feb 2018. Sydney - Seoul - JFK and back. For some reason 3/4 Of the flights were delayed due to “paperwork issues”. Something I’ve never heard of or experienced prior to korean air. Resulting in long delays for myself and fellow passengers. It was mostly a nuisance especially for someone who had a short connecting flight after. 

The food was decent however the seats were beyond uncomfortable. Decent for short flights but in no way acceptable for 13+ hr journeys. Entertainment was limited especially compared to other airlines. 

The service on board was inconsistent and drastically changed from one stewardess to another. A few might I say had serious attitude problems. One in particular refused to let me eat my own pre-purchased meal on the plane. Which has never happened to me in any airline, domestic or international. Being someone who has special dietary needs and is unable to eat airplane food it was beyond infuriating. I tried to reason with her but she refused to comply. Using the excuse that other passengers felt uncomfortable with me doing so when no one has complained. Her tone of voice was condescending and attitude unprofessional. Was not impressed with the service.

On the way over to Toronto I was given a window seat, and I have a great deal of difficulty getting into and out of the seat with my back disability—and they don’t seem to understand nor relate to clients requesting “disability “ seats are doing it for a reason.

Comfortable long flight to Seoul,Singapore,Seoul,North Asia,It is my 2nd time flying to Seoul in Korean Air.  Majority of the passengers on the flight are Koreans and airline crew automatically speaks to you in Korean which I can't understand.  They will only speak in English when you start to answer them back in English.  Food is good for Korean selection.  The crew are also friendly and well groomed.  The only minus point is flying out of Seoul on Korean Air is the 23kg baggage allowance.  How is it possible not to overshop in Seoul?  Airline starts charging for excess baggage at 23kg.

Flight 3 & 4,Osaka,London,International,"This is a review of our third and fourth flights of our recent holiday to Seoul and Osaka. It all went smoothly leaving on time from Osaka and arriving a few minutes early
however we were stuck waiting on the plane for 45mins due to traffic on the ground at Seoul airport terminal 2 ( which only opened January this year so it doesn't bode well for the future). This delay obviously wasn't Korean air's fault so it didn't affect my rating.
 The first flight was pretty cramped as it was a 737-900 but we were fed and watered even on a 1hr 40min flight, our stop-over was just over 21/4 hours which which went very quickly, as previously mentioned we had a departure delay.
 The food was good with a western and Korean choice including various drinks, what was nice that if you asked they had small packs of peanuts to eat, a further snack was offered of a piece of pizza/rice ball or pot noddle. I like the fact that Korean air warns on its website that they will not guarantee a nut free flight, as it was a 747-8i the seats had plenty of room especially as I booked the first pair of seats directly behind the end of the 3 seat sections as I like that extra floor space between the seat and the wall of the plane for all those bits and pieces that you get whilst flying, things like carry-on bags also Korean air on long haul give slippers blankets, slippers,bottled water and toothbrush and toothpaste.
 The air staff were polite and efficient, clearing away the finished meals quite quickly which is nice so you get your space back. I forgot to mention the usb recharging point and also there is a mains supply below the seat, which doesn't need an adaptor as it takes a UK plug along with the Euro type 2 pin.
 I noticed one of the 4 seat rows which only had a passenger at each end which meant they had luckily 2 seat each have their good fortune quickly ruined by the crew allowing the partners of two very large people, one of which struggled to actually fit down the walk ways (how is this safe if an evacuation had to be carried out) to take these spare seats, basically being given 4 seats for the price of two. I didn't think this was fair to the rest of us. I know I'm being non PC but its how I feel. I would quite like to be charged for my combined body and baggage weight which is a much fairer way to pay.",June 2018,"June 17, 2018",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
Korean air 2,Seoul,Osaka,North Asia,"This is my second review on Korean air, the second flight of our holiday. This was a short flight and it would have got 5 stars except I could not complete an online check-in, which was a bit annoying as the hotel arranged for a guy to show me into the business centre to use a computer and more importantly a printer. The reason I could not check in online was that they had changed the model of airplane and they wanted to confirm my seat numbers at the airport which hadn't actually changed so that annoyed me a bit.
The airplane change meant we had in-flight entertainment available with a full range of movies available but not enough time to see the whole film!
 The very good thing was that they actually gave us a proper meal on a flight that only took 1hr 40mins, this begs the question why BA stopped giving food on short haul flights in europe, especially when you take into consideration that Korean air also has budget airlines to contend, Peach etc.",June 2018,"June 17, 2018",4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0

We arrived at the airport a couple hours ahead of time.  First, we went to the Domestic terminal thinking that since our flight was going to Seoul that it would be a domestic flight.  However, they immediately let us know that we would need to go to the International terminal.  

After getting to the International terminal, we did not experience a long line to check in.  The agent immediately checked us in and told us where we could go to until we were ready to go through Security.

The flight attendants were nice.  The in-flight service was good and timely for such a short flight.  

The airplane was clean.  It had ample overhead bin space and legroom.  

The flight arrived on time in Seoul.  The only issue that we had was that we really had no one there to tell us where the gate to our next flight was.  We had to go to a gate where we saw an agent at to find out where our gate was located.

First the flight was on time arriving a few minutes early. I have a special meal so I won't comment to much on that other than you always get a lot of fruit and salad. My wife was offered a choice of bibimbap or beef in tomato sauce she chose beef, now my wife ate all of it so it must have been ok as she is really fussy when it comes to inflight meals. Breakfast was another matter it was not good, the omelette left a lot to be desired and what was that red stuff on top and no it wasn't tomato they were to the side, nice fruit juice and coffee though, the continental was the better choice.
Service was polite and efficient and the steward described both meals available to my wife which was a better experience than we normally have on long hauls.  
 We booked direct with Korean Air as we have learnt that it may cost £20-30 more than say Expedia, but when I booked I chose our seats on every flight months in advance of our flight date, I even managed to book the same seats on each leg of the trip, saves an older gentlemen like me having to consult our boarding passes each time we board.
 The seats were comfortable with plenty of room (no BA, Ryan air or Easyjet here) it was really refreshing not having to fight for overhead locker space.The films available were very recent releases along with some classics, as I can sleep anywhere I mostly slept whilst my wife watched 3 films including Peter Rabbit which she found funny, not forgetting that Korean air have chosen a 10"" seat back monitor with usb charger and mains power under the seat.

Top notch professional,Bangkok,New York City,International,"This is not the first time I have flown Korean airlines and I must say it was both pleasurable and interesting. This particular trip was from Bangkok to New York with a connection in Korea. The only down side was the distance between gates, but I don’t think the airlines has much control over gate assignments. So that story will be a separate review of the airport. 

On both my flights I selected economy and an Aisle seat. The first aircraft was a Boeing 777 and the second was an AB380 and both seats were comfortable despite 23 hours total from gate to gate. Service was good to great and the food acceptable. In short everything you would expect if you were a VIP.

The one thing I found unusual and curious is all the flight attendants looked and acted the same. They were all very tall by Asian standards, dressed exactly the same and to be honest at one point I thought they were androids as they acted like machines, and when you went to engage them in some casual conversation there was no inner personality and they responded as if they were in the military or an AI still working on interpersonal programming.  That is not good or bad but I just found it unusual the human element was missing. During the flight one flight attendant sat in a jump seat scanning the passengers looking for anyone who needed help. When you pushed the call button someone was there in under 30 seconds. So customer service training shows and that can only be a good thing.

I would recommend this airline to anyone, and no more elaboration than that is needed.",May 2018,"May 24, 2018",4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

Also, the flight is so comfortable with A380. Larger seats and more space.
If you need anything, let the flight attendances know. They are always ready to help you out.

One interesting thing that you need to know!

"Polite service, well organised, excellence in flight",Auckland,Vienna,International,"I have been travelling long-haul with Korean Air for many years now and have been very happy with the service.  A couple of years back the airline, according to standard practice, upgraded me to 'Morning Calm' as a compensation for long-term fidelity towards the airline. This gives me the right to board with business class, although I am still sitting in economy -   and also to have  access 4 times to a lounge at the airport. However, recently the airline told me that unless I take another long haul flight before the end of June I will lose that status completely and revert back to 'normal economy' despite my years of fidelity in the past and my intention to fly Korean Air long haul in the future.   A long haul flight is out of the question for me right now, having just completed a long haul journey in March!  Unfortunately the airline's system appears to be inflexible and my past investment is going to be completely discounted.  To make matters worse,  it  is  extremely difficult to use one's award miles on Korean Air.

I had a problem with my connecting flight to Melbourne, so I had to interact with the Korean Air transfer desk in Hong Kong airport and they handled the issue impeccably.

Went by quickly,Seoul,Los Angeles,International,"Chose a two connection flight on my way to Bangkok in order to stay on Delta where i could use certificates to upgrade to Business.  In the way home, I opted for Korean to go direct.

As nice as business class can be, the direct route was better as it saved so many travel hours.  Since i was moving point to point diring waking hours, the lack of lie-flat didn’t matter.

Food was OK.  Leg room was OK even for me at 6’ 4”. Entertainment system could use a few more movies.  Flight attendants are much friendlier than Delta.

A pleasant flight,Singapore,Seoul,North Asia,"It was a midnight flight to Seoul and I was quite surprised to see an almost full flight when I reached the boarding gate. The aircraft was the big Boeing type, would say looked pretty new or well maintained. The seats are very spacious and roomy with no issue of cramping my legs. I've read reviews of how old the aircraft from Korean Air, with no inidivdual monitor at all. But on this flight, it has the individual entertainment just like any other flights I took from other airlines. The only downside of the entertainment was not much selections/choices of movies. It will be good to offer a wider range of selections of movies than just 2-5 choices. Going back to the service, the crews were professional, polite and friendly. Not sure if its on intention but they have crew who speaks Mandarin to have a badge on the uniform and also specially taking care of the isle where I'm seated with quite a number of Mandarin speaking passengers. They explained to you in details of the food they are going to serve, like the ingredients used etc. But the food wasn't really fantastic, not as good as I had on other airlines. For this, they need improvement.  They were also very attentive to your needs and constantly walking along the isle making sure the passengers were in good hands. Hence, there wasn't a need for me to press the call bell for them. As for cleanliness, the isles were quite clean but spotted some dirt at the window seat, where I was seated. Found some food crumbs on the side, which, was quite difficult to reach though. Still, these are the areas that should not be missed as it may ended up attracting pests. Hope that the airline can improve on this. The only complaint I have for them was the check-in baggage. For normal economy, passengers are only given 1 check-in baggage max at 23kg. I travelled on JAL at the same economy class, they offered 2 check-in baggage of max 23kg per baggage. It is only for premium economy class then they offer the same baggage service as JAL. Please look into offering similar baggage for the normal economy class. I will definitely consider Korean Air in my future travelling list, if more baggage is allowed. Overall, I have very pleasant experience with the airline and hope that they keep up the good work and improve on the areas pointed out in my comment.",April 2018,"May 19, 2018",4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0

Online check-in was easy and on the day there was no queue to check our luggage in.
Cabin staff are always friendly and serve you with a smile.  I found the choice of on-board entertainment a little limiting but there is enough to choose from to pass the time away.

"Perfect flight.  Great cabin crew, food and service",London,Jeju,International,"I have flown Korean Air once before and the service is consistent.  The cabin crew is what you would expect from a Korean service, quiet, respectful, prompt and gives good service.  The in-flight movies are a good selection with many being in English and a couple of classics German and French films with English sub-titles extended the menu for me.  The food is a good quality and as a vegetarian I was pleased with my meals.  The seats are standard and adequately comfortable and the complimentary pack of eye mask, slippers, etc, the use of a blanket an pillow are included.
My only grumble is that some people still recline their chairs to sleep which is Economy is really selfish to the person behind and I would like to see apolicy where the seats are fixed in upright or if this is not feasible in case of access in case of unexpected illness, the cabin crew make it clear to the ""offender"".

The seating is also awesome especially if you can get the chance to fly on one of their 747-8i. Big plus now is if your connecting through ICN Korean uses the brand new Terminal 2 which is massive even when busy you cannot tell.

2) the lady we turned to in the counter was asking to know the rest of our vacation plans after we leave from jeju, recording everything on the pc.

Complete joke,London,Cebu Island,International,"Paid 1,000 pounds round trip for a flight to the Philippines. Out of the 4 flights, 3 were delayed, and the entire entertainment system wasn't working on my way from London to Seoul (12 hours)... BUT Korean air is such a great airline that they offered me a 50 pounds voucher to use exclusively on Korean air (not even sky team miles), which is great since I'm planning on going back to Asia very soon, using that huge voucher that will almost pay for an entire flight (I am of course kidding).
You say that you are part of sky team? Well maybe you should act like it. Airlines like Air France give at least 200 euros cash in such cases (I can testify).
I don't care much about your ""regrets"" (looks like you know that word pretty well, basically all you can say in your emails), and I don't know what is more ""regrettable"" (another word you know how to use, congratulations), the fact that I spent 12 hours without anything working on the plane, the fact that 3 out of 4 flights were delayed, or your complete lack of consideration for your clients.

Good JFK to HKG flight,New York City,Hong Kong,International,"Returned from JFK to HKG recently, experiencing an expected good flight with Korean Airline. 

Check-in at JFK was timely and painless. First-leg flight departed and arrived at Incheon International in Seoul on time. Seating was spacious, comfortable with plenty of leg space for taller passengers. In-flight meals and entertainment were good, all very similar to past flights with this airline. 

What wasn't so great this time around was the in-flight service. The attendant working our section of the plane oddly skipped skipped us on four separate occasions while servicing passengers during flight. This occured when topping up wine during first meal, later while providing snacks and then drinks during mid-flight and lastly while picking up hot towels before our end of flight meal. This was odd and not something we've experienced before with Korean Airline. Must have been a new and inexperienced attendant. 

Another disappointing aspect of our first-leg flight was a bad odour that we encountered numerous times during flight. We were seated two rows from the toilets which we believed to be the source of the smell. However, that said, I wouldn't rule out that the source might have been another passenger having some issues during the flight. 

Layover at the new Terminal 2 at Incheon was easy and relaxing. After a couple hours we were boarding our onward flight home to Hong Kong. 

Second-leg flight departed and arrived around 15 minutes late due to weather conditions in Seoul. Otherwise, we mostly slept during this flight. A few hours later we were landing in HK. Luggage made its way to the carousel 20 minutes afterwards and we were out of the airport and on our way home. 

In the end, a couple disappointing aspects in regard to our long haul flight from NYC to Seoul but a smooth onward flight from Seoul to Hong Kong. We put the former issues down to a bit of bad luck, nothing to prevent us from using this airline for future long haul flights out of Hong Kong.",May 2018,"May 9, 2018",4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0
Excellent service,Jakarta,Los Angeles,International,"This airline really excels in the service sector, with extremely well disciplined flight attendants and great food. The crew were always well-intentioned, from all the 4 flights I took.

The lounges in ICN airport (before they moved terminals) were quite bland, and did not have much interesting food. It was often overcrowded, and not quite good.

Overall, I believe that this airline is quite great, especially with the great food (even western foods were good), large portions, great & consistent crew. If you’re flying from asia to the west coast, this airline is extremely worth the try.",December 2017,"May 9, 2018",5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,

Very good but there are better,Seoul,Paris,International,"This was an A380 business class flight. 

The seat was 6/10 compared to other airlines in similar class. The seat didn’t really go fully flat - I would say 95% flat

Although I had a aisle seat the window seat  passenger still had to step over me to get out. It’s ok but I prefer a more private seating configuration which other cabins offer. 

The cabin crew were all great and couldn’t do enough for you. 

The food was also excellent. I had a steak and it was very tasty, exactly how I ordered which I still think is clever, how they do this on a plane with the equipment they have is to be applauded. 

The bar area at the rear of the cabin was nice to go and have a stretch and a chat with other passengers. It helps to break up the 12 hour flight.

Awkward check-in but overall good flight from HKG to JFK,Hong Kong,New York City,International,"We recently used Korean Airline for a flight from Hong Kong to NYC. Beyond a minor inconvenience experienced at check-in our flight was very good, as they have been with this particular airline in the past. 

Flights were made directly online at the Korean Airline website around 4 months prior to our holiday. There was a flight sale near the end of 2017 and we were able to book fantastic rates for NYC at that time. Email notifications regarding flight status  the new Terminal 2 at Incheon Airport were timely and appreciated. 

Check-in at HKG was awkward. The check-in staff member wanted to separate us for our flight out of Hong Kong. This was a very strange request, something we might have expected of a LLC but not a reputable airline like Korean Airline. 

We calmly complained that we preferred to sit together and were surprised that they were asking us to do this. A manager quickly came to assist, apologised greatly  and remedied whatever situation they were having. In the end, nothing happened but we left the check-in counter a bit surprised with our experience.

As for the flight, all went well as expected. Flights departed and arrived on time. Our 5 hour layover in Incheon was smooth. The new Terminal 2 is very nice and comfortable. Seat comfort is better than average for economy class flights and leg space very nice for taller passengers. 

Flight meals were as expected, decent bibimbap and other bites. In-flight entertainment systems worked well, movie and tv show choices were reasonable. Flight attendant service was attentive and overall very good. 

Luggage arrival at JFK was too slow, just short of 1 hour wait after clearing U.S. immigration. This most likely had more to do with airport security and JFK luggage handling than the airline. We have experienced similar longer than usual waits for luggage on flights to North America quite a few times over the years.

Great service with Korean hospitality,Seoul,Tashkent,Asia,"I take this flight to Tashkent as this is the only airline from Asia that have regular flight (four times a week) to Tashkent. The flight was comfortable, very nice meal and choice of drinks. The crews are courteous with Korean hospitality. The seats are nice although not the best. The aircraft used for this route is Airbus 330-200, which was nice and quiet. The schedule was on time both ways and the boarding system was well organized. This is the only airlines that you have three choice of meals and always available (ever fly with Malaysia Airlines and they are out of stock). As Korean Air fly almost everywhere, it is very well connected and they have free transfer lounge with free shower and sleeping lounge. This airlines is not only good in air, but the service continues in land. Highly recommended and hopefully can fly again with Korean Air.",April 2018,"May 4, 2018",4.0,,,,,,,,

Why I like to fly with Korean Air.,Manila,Seattle,International,"I have been flying with this airline for some time now. I used to fly with different airlines going to the US and I found that this airline suits me well. 
     I like the ambience of the airline, the food and even if I may have either a short or long layover at Incheon Airport while waiting for my connecting flight to the US, by Korean Air also, I never get bored.         There are many things to do and see at Incheon Airport and if one gets tired, one may as I have found out recently by myself, one gets to rest or sleep in a rest area near the departure gates...for free...
     The airline seats are comfortable with adequate leg room even in economy class. The cabin crew are helpful especially when a passenger cannot reach the overhead bin to store his or her carry-on bag. 
     Did I mention that I like the food? I love everything about Korean food especially kimchi and bibimbap which I usually ask to eat when the cabin crew serves meals during flights. These two types of food go together in a tray with soup and dessert. I also like the soup.",April 2018,"May 4, 2018",5.0,,,,,,,,

Best flight ever,Honolulu,Tokyo,International,"Had an opportunity to visit Japan via  several airlines. We picked Korean Air because of the ticket price. Round trip from Honolulu to Narita the fare cost $533, less than a flight from Honolulu to Las Vegas. When we were delayed out of Honolulu I had bad feelings about the airlines but once we were on our way my mindset changed completely. It started with the boarding protocol. This airline start boarding passengers from the rear of the plane which to me made things much more efficient. The fight attendants assisted almost everyone with the overhead compartment helping to clear the aisles quickly. The complimentary movie selections I would grade at a “C” but the meal service more than made up for the lack. It started with a hot refreshing towel to cleanse our hands and face before eating which meant I didn’t have to make a trip to the restroom to wash my hands. The meal tray was pleasantly arranged with REAL  flatware and an honest to goodness glass cup for water. The bibimbap included a little tube of kochujung sauce and the taste of the dish was incredible. The comfort of the seats were ok but it didn’t matter much to me since I was able to snuggle up using the good sized soft blanket provided to every passenger. I was surprised to learn that despite the initial delay we arrived several minutes early.

Movie selection was decent. Service was also very good. The only problem I had was with the seat selection process--you can't select economy seats for flights from the USA or Canada until 24 hours before. In addition, I used a Discover card to purchase the seats, which meant that for some reason they needed to verify that my ID matched the card in person before I selected my seat--essentially I wasn't able to select my seat until I arrived at the airport to check my bags. I even tried driving out to the airport the day before but couldn't find anyone in person at the ticket counter because the only flight they had that day left a couple of hours prior.

The planes are new, staff is almost always efficient and very friendly, and check-in is generally efficient. Economy seats are about as big as they get and flying Korean Air is a true value buying through our travel agent. 

For nearly 30 years round trip economy tickets to Thailand outside of peak season from the East Coast averaged around $1500. Sometimes it was $1200, sometimes $1800. This trip, our ticket from Tampa to Bangkok through Inchon in Feb-Mar was $940. Round trip to the other side of the planet! 

It's also worth mentioning the shock of switching to American Airlines for that final leg into Tampa. Old planes with old crews that are no longer thrilled to be there.

Food was horrible,Washington DC,Seoul,International,"Korean Air has a monopoly on direct flights from Dulles International Airport to Incheon International Airport.  The flight time is about 13 hours each way.  If you fly business class, the seats are fairly comfortable as they incline flat and level (used to be pitched foward).  The difference between business class and first class is just a bit of extra room and partition walls in first class.  The partition wall in business class goes up and down between two seats.  The first class bathroom is almost like a small half bath in a house, whereas the bathroom in business class is much smaller.  Overall, the comfort of the seats and the level of service of the steward/stewardess in business and first classes are good, and while it would be difficult to call either luxurious, it is fairly comfortable.  
The cost of a business class seat is about $6,500 to $7,200.
The cost of a first class seat is over $11,000.
My wife and I have flown in business class between 2-3 times a year over the past 20 years.  During that time, we have flown in first class several times, with the latest time in first class being 3 years ago.  
Now for the food.
The quality of food has come down, down and down over the past 20 years to where now first class food is barely edible provided you carefully inspect your food before putting it in your mouth.  Yes, it is different than business class, but not by much.
The business class food is simply inedible.  On our most recent trip in December 2017 as well as our earlier trip in May, 2017), my wife and I both got food poisoning going to Korea.  By the time we landed in Incheon, we were both experiencing gastrointestinal distress and spent the next 48 hours recuperating at our hotel (Grand Intercontinental).  This is a description of our food experience on Korean Air on our most recent December 2017 trip.  My wife ordered the chicken and I ordered the beef filet for dinner, and for breakfast, she ordered the noodles and I ordered .  The appetizer seafood on a piece of lettuce that is initially served is inedible because the smell is that of bad shrimp - I do not recall ever having eaten this standard appetizer - I only remember times of bringing the plate to my nose and then as my nostrils closed in reaction to the smell, bringing the plate down sharply as the waft of bad shrimp (we all know that smell) tries to creep up your nose.  That smell dictates your instincts to put it down and away from your nose and lock your mouth against it.  The salad then came, and my wife who ordinarily loves salad skipped the salad because she felt funny about whether it was even washed.  In her words, ""I sense a lot of bacteria on the salad.""  Thus, the salad was passed as well.  We tried to eat the bread - a variety of poor quality, stale buns served with a single small yellow pat of what is hoped to be butter (although there is no smell, taste or consistency of butter - it only appears to be butter).
BTW: if you want Champagne, you must ask for it - it used to be offered as a matter of course, but that was years ago.  Even after the first half flute, if you want more (since the flute is small like the rest of the glassware/silverware), you must ask again.  The policy appears to have become something like, ""don't serve Champagne - glass for glass - until and unless it is specifically requested, and then don't offer the higher quality in business class, only in first class, but again only if requested.""  This ""if-then"" policy or algorithm regarding Champagne is rather insulting and, although I don't usually drink champagne, my business partners who do are left feeling like beggars in business class having to ask for each small half flute of champagne at a time.    
When the main course came, my wife took one look at her chicken, poked at it with her fork and immediately gave up - the chicken was hard rubber in texture, and a smell of wet chicken feathers emanating from the clump of meat was unavoidable.  My filet of beef, however, was edible - I asked for and used the Korean Air red pepper paste (probably the best thing on the menu) and covered each bite of beef in this red pepper paste.  
My wife could not eat the chicken, so she tried to eat the Bibim-Bap - an iconic dish for Korean Air that has been slowly reduced in quality over the years to where the current quality does not match even the quality of bibim-bap at a Namdae-Mun outdoor street vendor.  Not being able to stomach the Bibim-Bap, she decided that she would resort to eating the (you can't go wrong with) ramen or instant noodles that they cook up in the microwave.  The ramen was fine - the ""oi-ji"" or the picked cucumbers side dish was not - they were bad. The pickled cucumbers was the culprit that caused the food poisoning.  Later in the flight, I also ordered and ate the ramen with pickled cucumbers.  My wife was sleeping, and I had did not know that the pickled cucumbers were bad.    
After landing and arriving at the Grand Intercontinental Hotel, we sought medical care and after some medicine and resting for 48 hours, we finally felt better.  What an ordeal!  And, this was not the first time.  
We heard and learned from various sources that the current ""owners"" of Korean Air is a family (surname Cho) that is unusually stingy and tight-fisted when it comes to money.  Apparently, one of the daughters of the chairman of Korean Air is in charge of the food service on all Korean Air flights.  After years of whittling and cost-cutting and eliminating what they could, Korean Air could not cut anymore from their food service.  Korean Air then sought to outsource all of their food service to a third party supplier, whose pricing was very attractive to Korean Air.  This resulted in the service of inferior quality of food that is inedible.   
(A note:  The steward and stewardess are all very warm, helpful, courteous and there is nothing but praise for them.  They work very hard because they appear to be short-staffed to handle all of the passengers.  There were more stewardesses years ago.)
Fast forward 10 days later: When my wife and I were getting ready to take the return Korean Air flight from Incheon to Washington Dulles, we decided to pack our own food and completely avoid any food served on the plane.  We asked the hotel to prepare salads with other dishes and great breads from the hotel Grand Kitchen.  Next, we purchased croissants and other baked goods from Gontran Cherrier bakery below the hotel. We had a wonderful time dining on food that we could trust and which actually had flavor and proper texture.  No gastrointestinal distress during and after returning home.  
One more thing, you have to ask constantly for water which they are required to serve from large half gallon size plastic bottles - they will not give you the smaller plastic bottles of water.  I asked for a large bottle of water knowing that I could drink 2 large bottles during the flight, but they could not accommodate this request. 
CONCLUSION: if you want to fly fairly comfortably in business class while paying between $6,500 to $7,000 for a round trip ticket to and from Washington Dulles to Incheon, then you must BYOF - bring your own food!  
CLOSING THOUGHT:  Every time I think of Korea Air, I wonder when another airline will fly direct from Dulles to Incheon and break up this monopoly that Korea Air has on the Washington DC market.",December 2017,"April 19, 2018",1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0

Good Flight,Seoul,Phuket,Southeast Asia,Compared to most airlines Korean Air is better on legroom in economy class compared to US airlines. Narrow seats but ample belt size for large girth. Food is average. Service is good and professional.,April 2018,"April 19, 2018",4.0,,,,,,,,

The Aircraft and the Seats Sealed the Deal,Los Angeles,Bangkok,International,"After our last trip from Los Angeles to Bangkok in coach, we decided that if we went again we had to upgrade to something more comfortable. After some research I decided on Korean Air Prestige class and a schedule that utilized the Airbus 380-800 for the long haul between LAX and ICN (Seoul).

At the LAX Tom Bradley Int’l Terminal we checked in early using one of the kiosks near the KAL counters. This allowed us to drop our bags quickly at a dedicated counter when they opened 2 hours before the flight. We received tickets for a Priority Lane at the security check and passes to the shared Business Class lounge.  

The lounge was quite crowded and the seating arrangement was somewhat difficult to navigate with carry-on luggage, but was much better than waiting at the gate. A reasonable selection of snacks and beverages were also available.

However, once we boarded the plane I knew we were in for a great experience. The entire upper deck of the 380-800 is Prestige class with two aisles separating three sets of two “seats”, which I would describe as a seat within a pod.  We had selected  window and aisle seats and first thing I noticed was that the back of the pod was not attached to the back of the seat, so when you are moving in and out and grab the back of the pod in front of, you are not jostling that passenger.  

The row spacing is so generous that I could not reach the literature pocket without removing my seat belt. The armrest contains the seat controls to tilt the seat and operate the footrest. There are also three dedicated buttons to position the seat at full upright, partial recline or the fully reclined sleeping position. It takes a while to learn the controls for the seat and even longer to master the entertainment handset.

We were also provided with a nice amenities kit and a noise canceling headset. Two storage bins below the window were very convenient for the pillows, blankets, amenity kits and headsets and also for our phones, tablets and other items that could slip down beside the seat or get lost on the floor.

At both the forward and aft ends of the cabin are small lounges with sofa-like seating and snacks. On the left side of the forward lounge is an unassuming lavatory door that opens to a nearly full size restroom that was a real pleasure to use.

There was beverage service soon after departure followed closely by the main meal.  While the food was very nicely presented I did not consider it to be memorable. The pacing of the service seemed a bit rushed as if they were anxious to turn out the cabin lights, which may well have been the case. While the wine selection was acceptable, the pours were more the size of a tasting and while refills were cheerfully provided it certainly increased the flight attendant’s workload. 

The KAL flight attendants have very stylish and impeccable uniforms and exhibit a very high level of professional friendliness that was always customer focused and attentive throughout the flight, but not intrusive.

After the meal was when we decided that the fully reclining seats justified the Prestige Class ticket price. During the 13.5 hour flight to ICN, we were actually able to get some decent sleep which was definitely a first for me.

The new Terminal 2 at Incheon was another pleasant surprise. Not only is the architecture impressive, but KAL has separate lounges for First and Prestige class. The two Prestige lounges are located in the East and West wings and we made our way to the one closer to the gate for our ICN to Bangkok flight.

The lounge was not only large (Reported capacity of 200 at one and 300 at the other) with comfortable seating, but had an array of food and drink better than some buffets I have visited. It also has a bank of shower rooms, each of which looked more like a hotel bathroom.

The INC to BKK leg of our flight was in a Boeing 747-400 that was outfitted with similar seating that was still quite comfortable but did not recline to the fully flat position. However, other aspects of that flight were just as enjoyable, as was our return from BKK to LAX, making this Korean Air experience one that we will remember for a long time.",March 2018,"April 18, 2018",5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0
Treated badly and profiled,Atlanta,Cebu Island,International,"I don’t recommend this airline to anyone!!
I was profiled at the airport by their young TSA agent for being a white male with tattoos. This was after going through their immigration check points and having to dump out my back pack contents .She even asked why I wear my luggage on my back and I said because it was a back pack and the questioning became even more invasive and deameaning as time went on,then just before my flight after one TSA agent checked my boarding pass and as I walking to the plane back came the racist Korean from hell. She started back asking more questions until I finally asked why are you prejudice against white males with tattoos. No answer after that and I boarded the plane.
The Korean stewardess do not care for Americans they will take care of the Asian passengers first and
we’re rude to me on my way to my trip and upon my return. The food is gross I didn’t eat it because after being treated like a criminal from hell I was actually scared they would spit in my food. I am a vet and a disabled Special Ops Firefighter II/ Paramedic. Never will I use this racist Airline from hell or go to that country ever again because I was treated pretty much the same in Korea and the Philippines!! It was 
Terrible please consider not using this airline because maybe not all get treated poorly but I talked to several Americans who advised they were treated 
The same way!! I thought at first it was because of my tattoos but I think it was more of a American thing after talking to others.  Use at your own risk.",April 2018,"April 18, 2018",1.0,,,,,,,,

Very pleasent,Hanoi,Seoul,North Asia,This was a red eye but without any travel negatives. Whether you approve or not a number of Asia airlines still staff their flights with young attractive ladies.

A fairly spacey economic class on this airline,Singapore,Seoul,North Asia,This is a second time i used this airline flying into and out of Seoul. Chose this airline coz its legroom is slight longer than most airlines. Their crafts are new ones and maintain clean cabins. It would be better if this airline to be less restrictive on baggage load (now 23kgs) and allow collective weight for more than one passengers. Their seats are comfortable for lightweight passengers and would appreciate if they can market thicker seats for heavyweight like me in the economic class as i need to toss around in my seat to make myself comfortable for long flight.,April 2018,"April 14, 2018",4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,,,,

"Great promotion, short on expectations...",London,Singapore,International,"This is my first time with KE on F, especially wanting to try their B747-800. It was a long flight (about 22 hrs, inc. transit at ICN) so I had 2 segment experience also with a B773ER.

The first thing that strikes you about KE is communication skills of crew were 'wanting' - I had to get myself understood. Check-in was excellent as expected for F passengers... Cabin service fell short of expectations - they will deliver service, but crew 'disappear' unless you call for them. The meal service was good, but nothing to be impressed with - I've seen better with some airlines. 

The F cabin had 6/8 suites but only 3 and 2 pax in each flight segment - so the crew were not kept busy. In flight sleep experience was great. But overall, there's no 'brag' factor compared to SQ or CX.",March 2018,"April 10, 2018",4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,3.0

First Time Flying with Korean Air - Awesome Experience!,San Francisco,Manila,International,"Great experience travelling with Korean Air! I was with my mom and sister who both needed assistance and I can tell you, the staff go above and beyond. The staff were all waiting at the entrance to the plane to assist and welcome us on board. Not only did they guide and held my mom to her seat but they also took care of our carry on luggage - carry them and put them in the bin. Definitely a 10 on customer service!!!

Entertainment was also great as we have so many choices for movies, etc. The movies are updated and we also have a choice of old /classic movies. The food??? Better than most airline food and I love that they have real cutlery and not plastic. 

I am now a fan of Korean Air and will definitely be flying with them again.",March 2018,"April 9, 2018",5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0

So disappointed in Korean Air,Washington DC,Manila,International,"Flew from Dulles to Manila. 1st part of trip from Dulles to Korea was about 14 1/2 hours. It was so hot on there we were miserable. We asked to have some air, but as usual the Korean flight attendants understood very little English. The food was horrible. They only served 2 meals for a 14 1/2 hr flight, which we werent' aware of or we would have brought some food.. The never told us upon arriving at the airport in Dulles that they weigh your back pack and carry ons now and add to the weight of the luggage, but after a long wait they waived the $200 fee for us. On the way back could not go on line to reserve our seats, they said there was a glitch in their system, so we had to get seat when we got to the airport.. ridiculous... So needless to say, we had to wait a long time for them to move things around and they did get us seats together, but horrible seats in the way of everything.. That is our 3rd time flying with them and we got a good deal, so that's why we did, but never again..",February 2018,"April 9, 2018",2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,1.0

Short domestic flight from Seoul to Jeju island!,Seoul,Jeju,Domestic,"Flew Airbus A330 from Seoul Kimpo airport to Jeju.   Our flight was slightly delayed due to late incoming aircraft.     It was only about 20 min delay so not a big deal at all.     Guess this A330 is only used for short haul sector as I noticed the seat pitch was rather tight for usual Korean air aircraft.    The flight time is barely one hour to Jeju island so no big deal either.    But I would hate to fly this aircraft to destination with flying time longer than three hour.     Flight attendants are polite and professional.        Due to short nature of the flight, they provide a quick beverage service with pretzels.    Arrived on time in Jeju.

I booked the flight through Delta though, and was unable to to access my booking on Korean Air's website.

Pleasant ride,Singapore,Seoul,North Asia,"It was the first time that I was taking Korean Airlines, and I have to say the uniform of the stewardesses were a pretty sight. Once seated, I noticed that the seats in economy were slightly larger than what I am usually used to but it’s all good. The legroom was quite ample too, so ample that the lady beside me was able to place a small stool to rest her feet! 

Not sure if they usually handout slippers or only because they were promoting the Olympics. but it was nice touch.

There were no meal menu cards, the choices for dinner were announced by the flight stewardess when they passed the aisle. I’ve heard so much about the Korean Air Bibimbap, so obviously that was what I opted for when it was my turn and I did not regret my choice at all!

Morning calm turns to evening delay!,Seoul,Bangkok,Southeast Asia,"There is a very nice business class, private and quiet check-in for Korean air in Seoul , which we managed to access with our Delta card. The check-in staff at the business desks in both Bangkok and Seoul were excellent. 
The return flight was delayed 2 hours due to the late arrival of incoming aircraft.
The flight was full and with a 5-hour flight and older aircraft it was ok but nothing flash. The seats were very upright. The 747 airplane was old and tired and the first thing the staff had to do was remove and replace the stuck toilet door. Having said that I really liked the upmarket body lotion and face misting spray in the toilets!
I ordered the vegetarian food which was inedible, on the way up the staff were happy to provide some extra peanuts and fruits and bread rolls on the way back the response was 'you pay and get one meal' and it was a struggle to get even one small packet of peanuts!

The gold standard for the commoner such as myself :-),Sydney,Seoul,International,"I really enjoyed my flight.  The crew was friendly and accommodating  without seeming fake about it.  The food was good and in a sufficient quantity.  My biggest highlight is the leg room.  I am only 64 inches tall and I have been on other flight where my knees touch the seat in front of me.  On this flight, I had plenty of room even when the seat in front of me was reclined.  This makes me feel that Korean Air cares about the comfort and health of their economy class passengers and not just their bottom line.  I did not feel like I was getting an embolism in my legs as I have on other airlines.  The seats were comfortable, the blankets were clean and smelled fresh, there was a water bottle at my seat upon boarding, there was a package with a toothbrush and toothpaste, and the bathrooms were serviced and cleaned regularly.  I watched 3 recently released movies and played games as part of the in-flight entertainment.  My only minor complaint would be that my meal tray had coffee stains from the previous traveler.  Although everything else appeared to have been thoroughly cleaned such as (thing I notice that others may not) my seat belt buckle, the button for reclining, and my touch screen and remote control, I think the cleaning crew may have forgotten to unfold the tray.  I will let that slide since everything else was top notch. Plus I always bring disinfecting wipes with me when I fly because I have seen unpleasant behavior from other passengers in the past so I always wipe everything down anyway.  Overall, I was very satisfied with the flight and I would certainly choose this airline again.",April 2018,"April 6, 2018",5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0
Excellent service & value for money traveling economy class,Vancouver,Manila,International,"We flew from Vancouver to Incheon then to Manila.  We missed our connection in Incheon due to delay caused by snow, and Korean Air was very quick to arrange a hotel with meals and airport transfer at no charge.  They clearly had a plan before we landed and it was very easy to navigate from the plane, through customs and to the shuttle service for an overnight in the hotel. 

2 hot meals served on the trans-Pacific flight.  We flew with our 9 year old daughter and the staff paid extra attention to her, giving kids headphones, activity package and stuffed animal.  We did the same flight the year before and flew with Air Canada, and Korean Air was a far better experience. 

Excellent service on all flights.  When we boarded there was classical music playing, soon after takeoff we were served water and a warm towel before eating.  Meals were serve with metal cutlery and a glass wine glass.  Red or white wine with each meal and staff came around to refill wine with both meals.  Tea and coffee served twice as well.

The private cubicles were comfortable, the food was great & the service excellent. I had twisted my ankle the day prior to this trip & the flight attendant brought me an ice pack & kept it refreshed. My only complaint was the short transfer times between flights in Seoul.  My outgoing flight allowed for a connection of 1.25 hours but I didn’t count on having to deplane down a staircase onto a bus which required going through security again & then racing the length of the airport to barely make my flight to Hanoi. My return flight was worse. The plane left HCMC 30 minuets late causing me to miss my connection & resulting in an additional 4 hour wait in Seoul.  The upside was a great bowl of bibimbap.

First time with Korean Air - to be repeated.,Seoul,Fukuoka,North Asia,The last leg of a trip to Japan booked with Air France completed with their partner company.

The area of my personal space (with a sliding door) extended over 4 portholes and the width of 2 seats.

We usually have to buy Economy Plus on Delta (which they do not have on Korean) to get such space. The seatback TV was the largest I’ve seen and offered a decent, though not expansive, selection.

Hope to fly KA again whenever possible,Chicago,Hong Kong,International,"We traveled from Chicago to Hong Kong a few weeks ago with our toddler, and could not have been more pleased with the experience. My sister had told me that basic economy on KA is basically economy plus on other (especially US-based) airlines, and she was right. 
For once, the flight staff on an airline actually made me like the experience, rather than detract from it. Especially when it came to our toddler, they really went above and beyond to make sure she was comfortable. They gave out special toys for the kids on each flight (a different one each time) and helped us get our stroller quickly after each leg.
If you’re not a fan of Korean food, though, you should probably bring food with you on the flight (same if you’re a vegetarian). I love Korean food, so it wasn’t an issue for me, but my husband’s a vegetarian and I felt really sorry for him when they brought the veggie meals. They only came around with snacks twice on the 14-hour flight, so make sure you bring extra food either way. 
That’s such a minor issue, though, and I’ll still be flying KA whenever possible in the future.",March 2018,"March 25, 2018",5.0,,,,,,,,
Getting better,Nadi,London,International,"I've now flown Korean Air to Fiji for the last 8 years and still consider it to be the best route both in terms of cost and convenience. It's cheaper than Hong Kong or Singapore and certainly avoids the American immigration trauma! The flight attendants are getting better at English as a language despite my arrogance at not learning anything other than hello and the food is also improving for us non Koreans, I'm sorry but it's very repetitive. The stopover in Seoul is for me a treat to look forward to as it is generally in a five star hotel and therefore I can afford to starve myself on the plane to enjoy a sumptuous treat in the buffet restaurant",March 2018,"March 23, 2018",4.0,,,,,,,,

From the moment I boarded positive things started. Smiling, smartly attired flight attendants made me feel welcome. I accidentally dropped my cell phone recharger cable while walking down the aisle- an attendant walked the aisle slowly prominently holding the cable to all seated passengers so we could identify if that lost object was my property.

"5 Stars for Flight, 3 stars for Website functionality",Toronto,Ulaanbaatar,International,"I've flown Korean Air a number of times and have been very satisfied with the politeness, level of service and professionalism of the teams.  

However it is hit and miss with their website functionality if you are buying their flights as codeshare (in my case from Delta).  Hoping once the joint venture details are ironed out, the experience will become seamless.

Some comments about the new T2 terminal at ICN:  

-- The Arex train is only a short way from the ticket counter.
-- The terminal has a more intimate feel.
-- The prestige lounge (no windows) are smaller than the ones at T1 and fill up quickly.  Furniture and shower areas already showing some wear and tear.
-- Korean air transit desk is at the opposite end of the gates used by Delta.
-- No Delta transit desk once in the terminal.  Be sure to use the machines before security check if you need to reprint boarding passes. 
-- If you land in the wee hours of the morning, use the free transit lounge before the rest of airport opens.  It is quite pleasant there.  
-- Also, only one security area is open and can be a fairly long walk.  No signage as to direction and minimal staff.  Definitely need to do better there communication wise.",December 2017,"March 14, 2018",5.0,,,,,,,,
Half Way Around The World,Fort Myers,Phnom Penh,International,"Picked up a KE 777 aircraft in Dallas-Ft Worth for a Mission trip to Cambodia with connecting flight n the brand new Terminal 2 oat Incheon Korea.  Our layover was only 50 minutes which is impossible to meet in that airport in the best of circumstances, but with the ""Transfer"" security procedure they imploy, it can't be done.  However, about15 minutes out of ICN, a flight attendant came to us and had us grab our carry-on items and follow her.  She seated us in a couple of vacant ""first class"" section seats at the forward door for a quick exit to try and help us meet our connecting flight.  I have to give them a n ""Atta-Boy"" for their effort.  Unfortunately this brand new terminal (opened 18 Jan 18) most modern terminal around, BUT, when you de-plane the dump you in an ""unsecure"" hall which runs the entire length of the massive terminal.  You have to walk/run from your arrival gate to the middle of the huge  horseshoe terminal and go thru a full security screen, exit out the back up a single escelator to the ""secure"" gate area directly above the area you just came off of.  Then find your departure gate, normally close to the gate you just de-planed from and walk/run to that gate hoping to catch your flight.  This ""Transfer"" security design and procedure adds at least 45 minuted to the process and is causing missed connections.  While this new terminal is beautiful, has every modern amenity in it, and can easily handle the millions they project, I have to give it a ""fail"" because of this terrible ""Transfer"" security process...",March 2018,"March 14, 2018",4.0,,,,,,,,
Superb!!!,Seattle,Ho Chi Minh City,International,I had never flown Korean Air before but decided on this airline for our trip to Vietnam.  What a great choice.  Every encounter I had with the folks from Korean Air was fantastic.  Their staff is extremely friendly and helpful.  The flight itself was long and I was worried about making our connection through Seoul.  No worries as we were right on time with departure and arrival giving us plenty of time to make our connection.  The flight was extremely comfortable due to the fantastic service and accommodations.

Madness in Flight Korean Air,Seoul,Yangon (Rangoon),Southeast Asia,"Having dinner and after may be 3 or 4 glasses of wine.
Note: smallest wine glasses in any business class I know and poorly filled
The flight attendant told that due to Korean Air internal rules I need to wait for two hours before I may have wine again!
And unbelievable really after about two hours she came back, unrequested, late evening, dark cabin, offering wine, which certainly I had to reject.

I am quite sure that eventually the otherwise good Bordeaux 2011 was pored down the toilet.
There were only about 5 other passengers in business class and all more or less asleep!

Especially as on the flight back there was also the same limited programs. A few new releases, a few Hollywoods films, a very few classics and then asian films I am not really interested in. If the airline is interested in more customers from Europe they should work on that to put more international (western) films on screen.",February 2018,"February 24, 2018",5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

The food, while not gourmet, is the best I’ve ever had in economy and the flight was less than 2 hours long. Back in the US, you’re lucky to get a bag with 10 peanuts without an extra charge!

OK business class,London,Seoul,International,"Frankly, the reason for selecting this flight was the fact it provided a direct route at a convenient time. It's a pretty standard, fairly old-fashioned business class product: 2-2-2 configuration with flat beds. You're obliged to step over your neighbour if seated by the window, and there's not great privacy between the two of you. The seat is reasonably spacious and comfortable but lacks storage space for laptop, iPad etc. TV screen and controller are old-fashioned, but a good selection of films on IFE. The meal choice is fairly limited, but the steak is excellent (have had twice on KE flights recently and good both times). Wine good. I don't like having to choose my second meal (to be eaten 8 to ten hours later) as soon as I board, though. Cabin crew are fine - a bit mechanical but lots of smiles.

Surprise of the level of service,Hong Kong,Seattle,International,"Due to the budget set for my trip to Seattle, I was not able to fly the airlines that I usually use.
With the much lower ticket price, I was not expecting a lot.  And I Was Wrong.
I have to say, the services that the attendants offer was really out of the world.  And the quality of the in flight offerings are much higher than the usual standard I have received from the airlines I am a top tier elite member had experienced.
The only short coming, was the choice of language.  Only a few of the attendant can comfortably use English. As a non Korean speaker, this is a bit difficult to get things across.

So so,Jeju,Seoul,Domestic,"Travelled between Seoul and Jeju with Korean air. Love the online check in stands and the fast baggage drop off service.
However ground service is average. Our flight to Jeju from Seoul was delayed by 2 hours and the ground service staff were informative and apologetic (providing free beverages that they were handing out).
However when our Jeju back to Seoul flight was cancelled, there was a lack of service there. Understandably that this is due to the snow conditions. But there was huge confusion everywhere in the airport. Lack of information on how we could organise the next best available flight, information was also not provided in English. For foreign tourists, it would've been quite challenging to figure out what to do next.
Hopefully they will better their process if any future delays or cancellations.",,"February 19, 2018",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,,,
Pathetic experience and definitely not recommended to anyone,Fukuoka,New Delhi,Asia,"It was an international travel from Fukuoka (Japan) to Delhi (India) via Seoul (South Korea) by Korean Air. Due to the bad weather condition, the airline was kept on postponing the estimated time of departure in Fukuoka (Japan) Airport. The flight from Fukuoka to Seoul was 5:30 hours delayed approximately. During that time the staff at Fukuoka airport provided a can of coffee and nothing else. Anyway, I was worried since I needed to board another Korean Air flight from Seoul to Delhi. Unfortunately, I couldn't board that flight. I contacted airlines staff and the staff suggested me to take the next day flight from Seoul to Delhi. The staff happily showed incapability to provide any lounge/hotel for one night stay as well. I was supposed to reach Seoul in afternoon but landed in the late evening. I was completely exhausted and hungry also knowing that I needed to spend one night and a day until afternoon (15 hours approximately) before boarding the flight to Delhi. Now, the flight to Delhi was kept on postponing. During this time period, I contacted airport inquiry and tired to contact airline staff but couldn't find the airline staff in various attempts. Not to mention that airlines didn't provide any food since they didn't bother to contact me at all. Note that the flight which was supposed to take off afternoon was finally rescheduled to 20:00 hours approximately which made my stay at Incheon Airport (Seoul) 24 hours approximately. It was indeed a pathetic experience and I was left with no energy. The airline should treat the passenger properly and also provide accommodation if flights are rescheduled. I would definitely not recommended Korean Airlines to anyone.",December 2017,"February 17, 2018",1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0
"Outstanding, if not for the movie programs",Brisbane,Rome,International,"The Korean Air flights are very well scheduled, serviced and run. It is clean, efficient and polite.Leg room in ordinary aisles is greater than other airlines, seats are good (though nothing but regular stretching saves your back over two 10-hour flights in the row.  Flying long-haul frequently makes every consideration important.  Movie selection is quite poor though, not enough of good Hollywood movies, Asian and European movies are scarce altogether, which is a great pity.  Documentaries are good, but not enough of those for 20hours of flying and then 20 on return trip.  There was no change in the movie list within 3 weeks.  Still, they are the best for the moment.

Ground service Booo!,Chicago,Manila,International,"Over all the experience was ok. The ground service was another problem. When I am traveling with someone I would like to sit with that person. Our tickets were booked together. However, we were seated separately on the plane. Both legs from Chicago to Korea and the onto Manila. In Korea they got us onto 5he plane, locked the doors then had us sit at the gate for 3 hours because of “fog”. Not sure where the “fog “ was but we didn’t see it. On the way back they forgot to transfer one suitcase. I thought it was nice that we were met in Chicago by a nice lady saying our back would be delivered on Monday because Korean Air doesn’t have a flight until late Sunday night. That would have been fine. Only problem was it did not get delivered on The day she said. I called on Tues and Wed with no one answering the phone nor returning a call to my message.Finally Thursday I sent an email to corporate and got a response about an hour later. Talked with a nice guy, who said he brought the bag to the delivery service on Monday. He promised to check into it and get back to me on Friday. That he did.

Korean air employees; very special,New York City,Manila,International,"Travelling to Asia takes a while and comfort matters.  Korean Air offers business class in the upper middle range of other airlines in terms of amenities, wines and bed comfort.  They are not at the top with their wine knowledge and their beds, once fully extended, are narrow and limit movement.  Food wise, they do an inconsistent job with western food but can't be faulted for their Bibimbap (traditional Korean meal) and fabulous teas that come along. The food is served with a smile and the attendants are patient and very dedicated.  It always amazes me how Asian carriers have such disciplined and organized crews - very refreshing when you've been around a bit!. 
There is two meal service on KE; dinner after take off and breakfast about 3 hours out from landing.  All of it is coordinated perfectly.  In the night, there is little for snacking if you are a non sleeper - KE could change that with a ""larder-pantry"" like British Airways does; it would gain it some points for sure.  Another very appreciated fact on KE is that the lavatories are maintained throughout the flight in very clean and organized conditions - Above all, it's always about the staff in the end and Korean has some of the best and most skilled people on board.  They smile, they are helpful, they are clean and put together with care, they introduce themselves at the start of the flight and truly make you feel like you are their only concern.  The first time I decided it was best to stick to their food than my own, the staff showed me how to proceed, mix and take the whole process in.  I'm grateful for that and know how rare this interaction happens nowadays? At intelligent intervals, the captain comes on with an announcement that is short, smart and updates everyone.  All in all, KE does a really good job with their customers.  Once on the ground at Inchon, there is a new FABULOUS terminal 2 to welcome you.  It is simply the best terminal I have ever seen, it is quiet and magnificent - so peaceful, what an oasis!  The connecting on wards is easy, the KE lounge comfortable with food, drinks and wifi (there are 2 lounges depending on your arrival time - check at the information booth).  All in all, good job KE and very consistent.

Worst international flight,Seoul,San Francisco,International,"The flight home from Seoul to San Francisco was utterly brutal. My first complaint would be that there is no air ventilation on this flight and depending on where your seat was... The air was stagnant. Several times I asked the flight attendant to turn on the air which they would not do. I was wearing a tank top and so hot that I had an asthma attack. I begged 6 times to please turn the air on because I was having difficulty breathing. They would say that they would look into it but would not turn the air on. The cabin has central climate control and where I was seated... There was air flow. I had a full blown asthma attack that my rescue inhaler did little to help. This went on for hours where not 1 flight attendant stopped to see if I was okay. I just remembered laying my head in my lap and wheezing, trying not to pass out. I could see several flight attendants pointing and talking about me but no one came to help. I've never felt more helpless and overall angry with the service

in Incheon, we were surprised at the number of whose flights were either delayed or cancelled. We have waited for almost an hour when we were told of the change in gate.

It was the wee hours if the morning then and we were already starving. Most of the restaurants were already closed while the remaining ones were either with very long lines or very limited food. Korean Air didnt even give us nuts or light snacks!

We waited for almost 2 hours at the gate. When we finally boarded we were inside the plane for almost 2 hours. Reasons were they have to wait for some passengers, the plane had to refuel, the bags had to be transferred and waited for the new crew to arrive. All these happened when we were already on board and the crew didnt even give US any food.

WTF?! No, I never!

So I was assigned to the rows for non-self check plus luggages check in by stall. It took me 30 minutes to complete.

We found our seats which were the window and middle seat  and we were hoping the isle seat would be left vacant.  Shortly after we got settled in our seats another passenger was seated in the isle seat beside my girlfriend and I.  This was a little annoying because after the doors of the plane were closed and the plane was taxiing down the runway for take off we realised that there were many rows on the plane with only  one person sitting in it.

mixed results,Auckland,Chitose,International,"The service on Korea Air is good, about the same as Air Singapore, so pretty good. The leg room is average. I was travelling with a very tall companion and he was comfortable. The trouble started when we reached Seoul where we had to change planes.  We were about an hour late leaving Auckland and we landed about 90 minutes late in Seoul.  There was no gate for us so we sat on the tarmac for close to an hour.  By this time we had missed our connection to Sapporo. The airline put us up in a nice hotel and we assumed we would bo on the next flight to Sapporo the following morning. But no, we were told the flight was full. We checked on the internet and there were still seats available. When we pointed this out we were initially offered business class seats at no extra cost, which we, of course accepted. Once we got to the airport the offer was withdrawn and we were stuck. After lost of phone calls to our travel agent in NZ, Korea Air got us on an afternoon flight.

"Business class seats are rather short, flattish but not great for sleeping.",Bangkok,Seoul,North Asia,"A380-800 so relatively modern aircraft. The business class seats have two issues. One is that there is the flip up foot plate. This is a problem when reclining if you are over say 5 11. Put the flash up and you have to bend your legs. Put it down and there is a large 'lump' that ruins the flat seat. A different design would be to at least make it so that when the flap was not deployed, you feet would hang off the end but at least your ankles don't have the double thickness metal plate. 

The seats are pretty flat though not horizontal. This probably means Korean can get another row of seats on the plane somewhere at the back.

Least enjoyable Korean Air experience out of many flights with them,Seattle,Seoul,International,"Last minute plane swap to an inferior Business Class product, delayed departure out of SEA... I do love the 777-300ER... such a wonderful airplane.  I wish they would put individual air vents ... Asian airlines just keep their planes SWELTERING in the cabins.  My Dad and I were pouring sweat.  Food was just okay on this flight...  I'm not sure who taught the flight attendants to pour champagne but they need to triple the pours.  They only pour in about 1"" of champagne into a very small glass.  I felt bad after a few refills to keep asking but really it was about 2 or 3 sips per pour.  We then flew them the next day from ICN to Phuket HKT.  Leaving out of T2 at ICN - the Korean Lounge was UNBELIEVABLY bad.  It was body to body packed, the announcements were unbearably loud, the food offerings were poor quality, and at the bar - I went to get a drink and stood there 10 minutes with no bar tender.  Finally one of the ladies clearing tables came to me and said ""No Bartender, get yourself!""

Awesome service,Brussels,Vientiane,International,"The reasons I’m giving Korean Air a 4* review and not 5* is because of food and entertainment. The vegetarian food is quite bad, to be honest. If you can, choose the vegetarian Hinduh meal, as that seems to be the only meal with some flavor. Entertainment is very limited - 1 Friends episode, 1 of House, some old movies, that’s about it. 

On to the good news! The above mentioned is easily survivable (bring your own movies on a tablet, don’t be a vegetarian) because of the downright excellent service and friendliness of the staff. They were so incredibly helpful, I’ve yet to come across a service that’s comparable. We encountered several (non-KA-related) issues on our flight to and from Laos - one of which being us missing our flight, to name an example - and they have helped us out enormously. 

If you’re in doubt as to whether or not fly with this airline: just do it. Like I said, bring your own entertainment and some snacks, and you’ll be fine. It’s worth it in the end.",January 2018,"February 1, 2018",4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,,,

Great Experience,New York City,Manila,International,"This was my first time flying Korean Air. My itinerary was JFK with Chg of aircraft in Seoul, Incheon airport then on to Manila. Service was very good, flight smooth and overall a wonderful experience.

I would be amiss if I didn’t make mention of Incheon Airport Lounge, with their sleeping pods, showers, exercise room and business center that is available to all fliers. I was blown away.

Manila Airport, on the other hand, was very chaotic with numerous security checkpoints. There were no airline attendee to guide you to your check in lines- everyone had to figure it out by themselves.",January 2018,"January 20, 2018",4.0,,,,,,,,
"Rude, Deceitful and discriminatory",Brisbane,Madrid,International,"This was the first time that my wife and I flew with Korean Air and it will be the last. On the way to Madrid we had a night layover in Seoul and were to fly out the next day at around 11.30 am. After the lengthy drive to the airport from the layover hotel, battling through various screening processes, we arrived at the gate at Seoul to find that there was no plane. Now the excuse of bad weather can only be genuine, if other planes aren't taking off or landing. This excuse wore out of the next 4-5 hours. When asked where the plane was the staff looked at us blankly and made some comment in their Korean language. By around 5 pm things were starting to get heated, despite a number of passengers seeking a response about where the plane was, the service staff continued to make excuses and were simply deceitful and disingenuous in their responses, claiming another hour, another hour. By 8 pm that night without any offer of food vouchers or even bottled water, passengers had reached their limit and were demanding answers, as to when the plane would arrive at the airport. Mind you planes were still taking off and there was  a bank of Korean planes sitting around on the runway. Still no answers, with the staff saying 9 pm. At 9 pm no plane, and the service staff announced that the plane would be leaving at  6 am in the morning, they promptly shut down the gate service area and disappeared, leaving hundreds of passengers without the offer of accommodation, food or even bottled water. Passengers were scrambling to find pieces of cupboard and blankets to find their spot on the floor for the night. 
It was quite obvious as the day and evening progressed that Korean Air excuses and were contrived and simply a delay tactic to avoid the expense of having to accommodate passengers overnight, due to their incompetence and failure to schedule its flights accordingly. The bad weather excuse was simply a lie and the fact they could not tell passengers where the plane was and looked blankly at them, was indicative that they had stuffed up the flight scheduling but were not willing to take responsibility for their actions. At  6 am the next day and after a 20 hour layover at the Seoul airport, the customer service desk was approached about the flight as there was nothing on the departure board. After querying the staff at the gate where they said the plane was going to depart they again talked in their Korean language and we eventually found out that they again did not know where the plane was. After angry passengers surrounded the staff (similar to a linch mob) and demanded to know where the plane was, magically a plane was located after being directed to various gates. We eventually boarded the plane, only to find out our  good seats, which had been booked through from Brisbane had been changed to lesser standard and we were crammed into a seating area with a feral family. Another 2 hours sitting on the tarmac, excuses again being used about late passengers, the plane finally departed for the 13 hour flight to Madrid. But wait, there is more, let's feed the passengers in the first hour and half and then not offer them any more food until an hour an half before landing, almost 10 hours without the offer of food, a muffin, piece of cake, cheese and crackers. 
The flight back from Madrid to Brisbane again left us in Seoul for two hours more than what we were supposed to, again excuses in Korean, of course.
By the way, it would appear that Koreans from economy are allowed to use the toilets, but other are not. After watching at least 20 Koreans from economy enter and exit the business class toilets, we went to follow suit and were promptly told by the staff that it was only for business class and directed back down to the economy toilets.
The reason we will not fly Korean Air again relates to the way they treated passengers and blatantly lied to them about the status of the flight from Seoul. The excuses they gave to try and placate passengers by stretching out the departure times into the evening were only contrived to try and avoid accommodating passengers for the evening. To this date we still do not know why the plane never arrived at the gate, nor have the passengers received any apology from the airline for the way they were treated and kept overnight, not fed, provided with water or accommodated. Given that we lost a night and day of our holiday and I would expect many passengers missed connecting flights and had their plans interrupted, it is clearly indicative that Korean Airlines is arrogant and doesn't really care the impact of their conduct has upon passengers and their plans.",December 2017,"January 19, 2018",1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0
Flight Delay: Very Bad Management,Seoul,Singapore,Southeast Asia,"My daughter was flying back from Seoul to Singapore. ETD 2 pm. 
The official announcements for the delay were made mainly in Korean & there was no English-Speaking staff around to deal with passengers' queries. After a 3+ hour wait (most of them on the floor, as there were no enough seats) , passengers were each given a $10 food coupon, but told to return to the gate within 1 hour! There was chaos & long queues as everyone rush to buy some food. 
Even then, no reasons were given for delay & why some flights (scheduled for a later ETD than 2 pm) were allowed to take off! Many angry passengers swam the helpless non-English speaking staff for information.
Blankets were than distributed (many passengers rushed to 'snatch' the blankets!). My daughter spent the night on the cold floor.
The flight only took off 18+ hours after scheduled ETD! 
We found out later that the delay was due to sea-fog. The situation could have been better managed & more proactive communication (English-speaking staff?) with affected passengers would have helped eased the stress & anger felt by many.",December 2017,"January 19, 2018",2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,,,,,
"Pleasant Flight, Good Service",Denpasar,Chicago,International,"I found both sets of flights on Korean Airlines to be pleasant and enjoyable.  Not the best airline I've flown but not the worst.  Overall, they rate quite ""upper middle"" in my mind.

The seat comfort was good, but not great.  The lie-flat seats from Seoul to Chicago weren't quite large enough to actually lie flat if you're over 2 meters (6 feet) tall.   The food was good, but not wonderful.  The cabin crew was always very polite and very helpful and their English is quite good.   I appreciate that the head flight attendant personal greeted and bowed to each person including my 9-year-old.   The entertainment system was good, but the options were somewhat limited given the extremely long flight.  The cabin in cheery (not drab) and very clean.  Overall, quite nice.

However, many reviewers noted that they can be rigidly bureaucratic, and I can see that.  When we first got on the plane the stewardess was quite insistent that she show me to my seat even though I could see my seat and definitely did not need any help making the 10 second journey to it.  She had to have the ticket in her hand because showing it to her was somehow insufficient.   Odd.

You should also know that we found Korean Air's checkin counters in Bali to be totally confusing.   Evidently they code share with other ailines(?) and so the check in counters will show Korean Air's logo on the screen and advertise check-in, but you can't check in there.   We spent 15 minutes trying to find which of the Korean Air check in counters was the real one out all the fake ones.",January 2018,"January 19, 2018",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0
OK flight with some issues,Auckland,Moscow,International,"Korean air is pretty good but not the top airline.  They always seem to have delays (long ones) at Incheon.  Ours was 6 hours with no information on what was happening, how long the delay would likely be except for an initial announcement of 40 minutes delay which came and went with no further info until an announcement in the business lounge saying the plane was now boarding and this was the final call.  We (and other passengers in the lounge) had to dash to the gate.  This was pretty bad service and desk staff in the lounge kept saying they knew nothing.  The notice board in the lounge did not show anything either.

"Well, it's certainly better than coach...",Seattle,Seoul,International,"We flew SEA-ICN as a leg headed for Phuket, Thailand.  Would never be able to do this were it not for using mileage awards accumulated over the past five years, but it's well worth spending the miles for business class.
I really didn't find Korean Air's service to be distinguished, although the FA's are always polite and friendly.  The food was so-so, and they are a bit conservative on the liquid's both alcohol and non-alcohol.  The seats, for business class at least, aren't what I would call super-comfortable, although they do recline flat.  I'm 6'-1"" and a bit wide in the girth, so the pods were tight- no fault of theirs, but not especially comfortable.
What is a considerable downside is the flight announcements.  They first give them in Korean, then English, which is to be expected.  However, the English spoken by the FA was quite broken and very difficult to understand over the PA system.  On the other hand, the captain's English was clear and understandable... he only made two announcements the entire flight, but they could be understood.
Suggestion:  The cabin, being oversized (777), can get noisy.  Be sure to bring noise-cancelling headphones or plugs.  Every sound is amplified as it echoes around the cabin.
The restrooms were a high point.  The FAs must be assigned to keep them clean and tidy, as they were throughout the entire flight.  Nice change from the cattle car airlines flying domestic in the US.

The flight I took from Atlanta to Incheon on November 29,2017 was the smoothest landing I can remember in all of the flights I’ve ever taken in any airlines.

Korean Airlines forced me to cancel the ticket, imposed a USD 200 refund penalty, suggested I buy a new ticket (which is almost double the price for the same route).  This is outrageous considering that at the time of purchase i) this may be their processing error, ii) they accepted my credit card payment at the time with my name on it, iii) my email has my correct name, and iv) my Skyteam pass registered at the time has my correct name.  I spent 2 hours going up the chain of customer service with no understanding of the situation.

Do not fly Korean Air,Toronto,Kuala Lumpur,International,"I would not fly #KoreanAir if I were you. 

Below is a letter i sent them over a week ago, and I received a canned reply. 

Good morning, 

My name is Brady Donohue, and on December 24 I had the unfortunate experience of having flown with Korean Air. My booking reference number is 77464402 and ticket number 1802322171432. My flight (KE074) was supposed to go Toronto Seoul with an ultimate destination of Kula Lumpur. I was meant to leave on December 24 at noon, and arrive on December 25th around 10 pm local time. My family currently lives in Kuala Lumpur, and I am now visiting them for the holidays. 

As you are aware, what was meant to be of course was not. My flight out of Toronto was delayed by nine hours, and when I arrived in Seoul I missed my connection to Kuala Lumpur. I had to wait an additional 8 hours in the Seoul airport before flying to Hong Kong. From Hong Kong I flew to Kuala Lumpur. It was to put it mildly an ordeal. 

First, Korean Air failed to communicate with customers. 
•	I never received an e-mail, or any communication, indicating my initial flight was delayed by six hours. Instead, when I woke up in the early morning hours of December 24 I checked the status of the flight myself and noticed the flight was delayed by six hours. 
•	It was clear to me before I even left Toronto that I was going to miss my connection. I called Korean Air, and waited on hold for nearly an hour. I was informed that I would be put on the flight from Seoul to Hong Kong, and then from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur. At that time, I raised with them my concerns about flying from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur on a different airline. I asked whether there would be issues in the Hong Kong airport as I had a very short turn around. I was assured it would be fine. They told me they would send me a revised itinerary, which I never received. 
•	When I arrived in Toronto I expected to get on the plane at 630 local time. At 615 I was notified by airport staff at the gate that the plane was still delayed. They did not give a time estimate.
•	An hour and half passed at the gate in Toronto, where we were notified over loud speaker that the plane would continue to be delayed for an indeterminate amount of time. 
•	Finally, passengers were asked to get on the plane around 815-830 local time. We then waited on the tarmac for an hour before finally taking off. 

It seems prudent to me that airlines would put a premium on clear communication with passengers. Managing expectations is hard to do when passengers are left completely unaware of what to expect. This is especially acute at Christmas time when passengers are anxious to be reunited with their loved ones. Why is it Korean Air did not send an e-mail or any communication, to its passengers notifying them of the first delay? Why is that when passengers were delayed for more than nine hours Korean Air failed to provide any sort of remuneration, in the form of food vouchers for example? 

At one point I approached Korean Airline staff. I was deeply frustrated but also concerned that a number of passengers would be hungry and thirsty. There were (as you would expect) young children travelling with their families, all of whom deserve some attention from airline staff. I was told that giving out food vouchers at 730pm would only further exacerbate delays. I take this to mean passengers were entitled to food vouchers but staff made the decision not to provide them. 

To be blunt, that is unconscionable. 

When I arrived in Seoul I was met with a continued lack of customer service. I went to the desk to get my boarding pass to Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur. I was told that I could not get my boarding pass for Kuala Lumpur. Again, for the second time I raised my concerns that by flying a different airline to Kuala Lumpur I was vulnerable to delays in Hong Kong, delays I could not afford. I was assured there would not be any problems. 

At this point it was December 25 in Seoul. It was clear that I was going to miss all of Christmas with my family, and not only that – I would delay further vacation plans as I would not arrive in Kuala Lumpur until late in the afternoon on the 26th. I asked the staff about remuneration ( accommodation, food etc) for passengers and was told that Korean Airlines had nothing to provide. I spoke with staff at the desk about the incredible lack of customer service. As a gesture of goodwill Korean Airlines could have (at the very least) provided passengers with lounge passes so they could take a shower, and have some food. I was told that I had a good idea but that I should write to management about it because they ‘did not care.’ 

I can’t give you the name of the person who told me that – and even if I had it I would not reveal their name. I would not want to jeopardize their post in your organization. However, I don’t need your staff to tell me that – it is clear in the behaviour of this airline that customer service is a low priority. 

When I boarded my flight to Hong Kong I had been travelling for more than 24 hours, and had accumulated nearly 17 hours of delay at the hands of Korean Air. In that time I was provided zero compensation (in the form of a shower, a food voucher etc.) I was offered a blanket and a bottle of water for what amounted to a prolonged delay in Seoul. 

We left Seoul airport 25 minutes late as we waited for passengers who never arrived. I told the staff that I had a plane to catch, that I had been travelling for a number of hours, and if we continued to wait I would miss my flight – they dismissed my concerns. I also asked staff in the air about my flight from Hong Kong to Kuala Lumpur. I had never been to the Hong Kong airport, and I was nervous. Where do I go? They told me ground staff would take care of it. 

When I landed in Hong Kong nobody assisted me in finding the right ‘desk.’ A kind stranger helped me. As I feared the airline (Dragon Airlines, which was unclear by the way as it was designated a Malaysian airlines flight) knew nothing of my reservation. I was, by this point, at my emotional end. Staff from Dragon air took me personally to the Korean airlines desk. I have to say, that while the staff at Korean airlines had been unhelpful at times, they were never overtly rude. This would change in Hong Kong where the staff chatted amongst themselves, and did a horrible job of conveying to me what the problem was. 

When I asked they told me ‘it would take time to figure out.’ I was in tears. I explained that I did not have time there was less than an hour before my flight departed for Kuala Lumpur. The staff at Korean Air ignored me. 

I suspect the man from Dragon Air was as frustrated as I was with Korean Airlines callous disregard for my plight. He took my passport and itinerary back from Korean Airlines, and printed me a boarding pass. The irony is: it was not Korean Air that helped me but another airline, an airline I had not paid personally for their service. 

I asked no less than three times about my flight out of Hong Kong, and three times I was told it would be fine. It was not. 
I had to run to catch my flight to Kuala Lumpur. Again, the man from Dragon Air escorted me to security, and told me how I would arrive at my gate. I almost missed my flight, which is intolerable having nearly been up at this point for 40 hours. 

I appreciate that some things are out of your control. What is not out of your control however, is how you treat customers. This is the thrust of my complaint. Airlines are entrusted not just with the transportation of customers from one destination to another. A person is rarely flying from point a to point b. They are flying to reunite with a loved one, to conduct important business, to refuel in the form of a holiday. Poor customer service, and lengthy delays make all of the above difficult. 

In this case, you were transporting hundreds of customers at Christmas time. You robbed me, and many others not just of a pleasant experience but of time with my family, time which I cannot get back. The impact of this is not just on me but on everyone who cares about me. My parents and brother whom I only get to see once a year sat in anxious anticipation of when I would actually arrive. I could not quell their concerns because I myself was not sure. 

Unfortunately I am bound to fly Korean Airlines back to Toronto. You can imagine that I am already dreading my return. Will I arrive on time? Will I arrive completely depleted? 

Treating customers with dignity is not difficult to do. Korean Airlines failed miserably in this endeavor. As I said, you can’t give me back the time I lost with my family but I expect a reply on you are going to remedy this situation, to the extent that you can. 

My current itinerary has me flying Kuala Lumpur to Seoul on KE672 on January 13, 2018. Then I fly from Seoul to JFK and JFK to Toronto. I booked this flight with lengthy layovers; however given my recent experience with Korean Air it would reduce my anxiety if I had fewer connections.

Not as bad as China Eastern,Seoul,Bangkok,Southeast Asia,"Outbound from BKK to ICN check-in counter did not open on time. Check-in staff sat around chatting, serving no one, until there were hundreds of people waiting. If you travel without luggage and dream of printing out your boarding pass at home and going straight to the gate skipping check-in, you can forget it. Your printed-out boarding pass means nothing. If you do have luggage, note that you are allowed only one bag; second checked bag costs US $ 150 or more.

Inbound from ICN to BKK gate change was not announced (at least not in English - the Korean passengers seemed to know more about what was going on) and 
flight was delayed for more than three hours with no explanation until we were ready to take off (de-icing and waiting for take-off slot) after boarding more than an hour late and sitting on the tarmac (without water or any other service) for more than two hours.

Better than most,San Francisco,Manila,International,Korean Air cabin crew are polite and keep the lavatories clean and well stocked. Even for economy the food is good.

I have to say, I was very happy.  I am Gold with Delta which gets you little out of Atlanta but actually comes in very handy with KAL.  They gave us priority check-in and boarding, priority cards to get through customs quicker and access to the Air France Lounge at BKK, very cool.
The jet was clean, the staff was super nice and the in flight meals were tasty (bibimbap and kimchi).  Meal came with Gochhujang paste which is ridiculously addictive.  They also did a good job of keeping my wine topped off (for free)

There was no meal or food on the 45min flight but a drink was given out soon after taking off. If you are planning on flying to CJU from GMP, definitely go with Asiana, specifically their A321s.

Fantastic Airline,Kuala Lumpur,Toronto,International,"I had never flown Korean Air before this trip to Malaysia. I was a little hesitant but there were several fairly detailed reviews from passengers who had taken the chance. The aircraft were excellent. Dreamliner to Seoul and 747 to Kuala Lumpur. Food and service on board was excellent. Could have done with a little more choice for westerners but, the other passengers seemed to be from the East. The airline needs to work harder with their ground staff. Not many smiles and warm welcomes on check in. The greatest disappointment was the business class lounge in Seoul’s Incheon airport. One would think that this lounge being in their home base would be impressive. Sadly, Korean Air allow economy class passengers to pay to enter. There are large queues of people paying to enter and passengers with business class tickets have to stand in line. It gets worse when you get into the lounge. It is packed. Hardly a seat to be found. The catering staff can’t keep up with demand and it is a huge disappointment. Would it stop me using the airline again ?? No. I will be writing directly to the airline about the lounge issue and, to compliment them on what they are doing well. In summary. Great value fares and excellent aircraft and cabin crew.

Great airline! full review - I hate flying,Auckland,Paris,International,"Great airline!. Good ticket prices as we booked our tickets approx. 10 months in advance. On the first leg of the flight was Auckland to Seoul approx. (11.5 hours). Great service, food was pretty good especially the seaweed soup and bibibap. Korean Air had provided a stopover hotel at Grand Hyatt Incheon (as we had a 16 hour stopover or so). Meal vouchers were provided for Dinner and Breakfast Great selection of food (best crispy bacon I ever had for breakfast). Rooms were spacious and clean. Definitely a 5 star hotel. Only issue was it was quite far from Seoul city but nevertheless went downtown at around 10pm while we went shopping till around 4am (such a great city! never been shopping till 4am lol).. Problem was there was no transport available other than taxi to get back (we paid approx. $65.00 USD - waived down a taxi driver) and a one hour taxi ride with no traffic. 

Our next leg of the flight was from seoul bound to paris. Great flight as usual with good meals. Flights and service was top notch. 

The downside: Snacks were Korean prawn crackers and shin ramen noodles - limited. Meals got boring on both our legs back to paris to seoul and from seoul to Auckland as it seemed they served the exact same meals. Ate two bibibaps on the way to paris but didn't want another on the way back. Entertainment system was a little old (comparing with AIR NZ's system) and limited choices of movies. 

Overall, great flight and I would fly again especially with the stopover at Incheon. It was a standout hotel (although far).",November 2017,"January 1, 2018",5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

The best flight ever - great customer service,Toronto,Seoul,International,"I flew with a lot a airlines in the past, from budget, economy  and 1st and i had the chance to enjoy the premium service.

On my last flight from Toronto to Incheon (and the way back) i flew with Korean Air in economy.  At the beginning i was not sure how good the flight would be considering the 12 hours it takes. I look at the 1st class, but the price was like 8K and prefered to spend that money in Korea and Thailand, which was my final destination.

From the boarding till the landing i had such a great experience.

At the airport, i was allowed 2 checked luggages (25KG each) and the carry on.  although i only used 1 checked, i thought it was excellent.

the food inside the plane was more than excellent and we had 2 full meals for the flight + snacks and all drinks (no extra fees)

Their flight attendants are so polite and devoted to their job, a bid plus!

Flight attendants are always helpful and patient with passengers, especially the demands from Korean and the help they have to give to non-English speakers. Food always good, drinks are served quickly so we do not have to wait forever and most of all, bathrooms are always clean. However, ground staff (both in Bangkok and Seoul) need to be trained to handle emergencies and disasters related to the flights. Announcements need to be made so both orally and signs (bigger than an 8x11 with so much information in it). Passengers need to be given sufficient information of why and how. I was told to step out of the line while waiting to check in explanation that my flight is not at that time (how could that be when it was 11 pm and my plane leaves at 12:55).

The Delay from Hell,Seoul,Chicago,International,"I was on my way back from a semester abroad and had a layover at Incheon. I had gotten in at 6 am and was supposed to fly to Chicago at 10:40 am. The flight was delayed due to heavy fog, which was understandable. What was absurd was we ended up being delayed for 9 hours! After about an hour the fog had lifted and we could hear flights being called and boarded. 3 hours later, we're still hearing the same ""Flight 037 has been delayed due to weather and a new boarding time will be announced ASAP"". Then we were moved from gate 8 to gate 27. There are two flights waiting in gate 27, so it's very cramped. Every time we ask for an update someone tells us only an hour...well word got out that they had given our plane to another flight, so now they had to get a new plane. They finally get a new plane, and we don't have a crew, We finally get a crew and we don't have a pilot. We asked for food vouchers, nothing. Our plane was given away, so we asked for refunds, nothing. We asked to be put on other flights, nothing. A half hour before we boarded they passed around a liter of water and some cups for people. That's it. If they would have given us clear information, we could've changed our plans or even left the terminal for food. But when you're told the plane will be there soon, you don't want to leave and then miss a flight you've been waiting hours for. Korean Air owes all of the customers on flight 037 to Chicago. You treated your customers terribly, we missed connecting flights, you didn't even try to make us comfortable during the wait. You staff flat out lied to us and customers that booked in advance and paid hundreds of dollars to get home for the holidays, barely made it to Chicago by Christmas Eve.",December 2017,"December 25, 2017",1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0

My one suggestion for improvement is to make these requests more accessible on the Korean Air website. Since my ticket was a Skyteam around the world itinerary, it was impossible to reserve a seat of request a special meal without 1 1/2 hours on the phone to the Korean Air customer service line. Even the Skypriority Customer Service people at Delta were unable to do the seats or the meals.

Instead of informing us the flight had been cancelled initially so we would have the option of rebooking and reorganizing our travel plan, they dragged us till 2am so that they wouldn’t be liable for accommodating us with hotel.

Economy ticket check-in line took me 55 minutes in ICN airport,Seoul,Osaka,North Asia,"I like Korean Air cabin service very much. Attendants are doing very good jobs. Food quality is good too. But in ICN airport, ground staffs made a pretty horrible job on deal with huge long line of economy ticket holders to check in their luggage. This happens on 11/22 morning 9~10:30am in 

We did not have the chance to print out the boarding pass after website check-in in Seoul hotel. Most of airlines will send out email boarding code also but not KE. End up in ICN airport, we are guided to line in again on the regular line. We waited for 20 min and saw no movement from the line. I talked to one supervisor for complaining long line on economy line. He acts like nothing to his business (typical communist bureaucratic style). My wife was told to print out the pass from machines but machine rejects my printout due to checked-in done in hotel already. Then we took another 40 minutes to check in our luggage. After our check-in, I am sorry to see the economy ticket line is still about one hour long.

Late arrivals and poor service,Osaka,Seoul,North Asia,"The flight from Osaka to Seoul took off an hour and forty minutes late. As a result, we lost the connecting flight that we had to take from Seoul to Tel Aviv.
The company representative offer us to fly one day later to Tel aviv via Istanbul and to arrive at a delay of 28 hours. He also told us that this was the only way to get to Israel as quickly as possible, and that was a total lie.I discovered on the web quite a few flights that could be offered to us so that we would get much faster home.
When I showed the company representative my phone screen with these flights, he lost patience and became very unpleasant.
He became irritated and began to try to persuade my wife to accept the offer he had brought to us at first.
At the time of the argument at the counter we were not even offered a glass of water or a place to sit and the representative was very aggressive.
Finally he found us a flight from Seoul at 19:00 to Beijing and was supposed to land there at 20:15.
From there on a follow-up flight departing from Beijing at 22:00 to Tel Aviv.
When I saw that the flight was leaving only at 7 PM, I asked if they have a LAUNCH where we could get something to drink or eat and then he shouted at me: No more service.
The representative also did not tell me that the flight to Beijing is landing at Terminal 2 and the connecting flight departs from Terminal 3 and has to pass from one terminal to another in a very short period of time.

What happened to Korean Air,Bangkok,Atlanta,International,"My husband booked my flight on Korean Airline because of the reputation for great customer service. My husband and I have previously had excellent service when we traveled in coach class. However, my entire flight in Prestige Class was very disappointing. The customer service by the flight attendants on all flights was below average. I was expecting alot more in Prestige Class. On previous flights, we have been treated much better in coach. I selected a noodle dish on KE 035 which was served with ice cubes floating in the bowl. I had to ask for water since the flight attendant rarely came by to ask if anything was needed. On my return (KE 036), I asked for bread but was told ""no"" since bread didn't come with my choice of meal. The flight attendant later returned with bread. On flight KE 659, I had to ask for a bottle of water but was told the flight didn't have bottled water. They served me a very small glass of water but didn't come back to see if I needed more water...I HAD TO ASK. I find it appalling Korean Airline didn't have bottled water. On the same flight, the meal I selected was not good so I ask if I could have the noodle dish. I was SHOCKED when the flight attendant brought me a bag of dried noodles and hot water. I don't know what happened to the excellent customer service experienced on previous flights but my entire flight was not worth the money spent on my Prestige Class ticket. This will be the LAST time I will EVER book a flight on Korean Airline. Food was terrible, flight attendants were terrible, the entertainment consisted of very old movies and overall experience was absolutely terrible.

So they started to sort something out and i waited another 15 minutes.
Same person showed up, offered me a ticket 3 times higher then i paid for the whole round trip and reacted annoyed when i declined.Then i had to return my standard tickets as they had to renewal them and i got promised to get the same seats i requested before.
Of coure when entering the airplane that didn`t happend i was seated between in a 4 seat row.

Respect for personal space,Manila,Washington DC,International,"I flew via Korean Airlines when I went to a business meeting at Washington DC in Sept 2017. It was my 1st time to fly via Korean Airlines and it was such a pleasant experience. 

There are many things to like in this airline: flight attendants are accommodating and respectful; the seats provide the privacy you need, which is very important if you're travelling for about 12 hours; list of entertainment options are impressive; food and drinks are great; and the airport lounge offers opportunities for travelers to take a shower.  
 
I like the fact that the design of the seats allow for privacy - this way, i get to have some needed sleep. After takeoff you can raise the partition between seats so that you have your own private cocoon. There's plenty of legroom, too. 

I am also able to go to the rest room without disturbing my seat mate as the window seat (to which i was seated) has direct aisle access (there's a narrow opening through which you enter the seat area).",September 2017,"December 8, 2017",5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Good airline to consider,Manila,Las Vegas,International,"My wife and I took Korean Air from Manila to Las Vegas via Inchon in Korea. Except for their on-line check-in which cannot be accessed, their check-in procedure at the airport was quite efficient. Check-in counters opened 3 hours before our flight and counters were attended to by young and courteous staff. Departure for Inchon was delayed by almost an hour due to the late arrival of their aircraft. However, passengers who would have miss their connecting flight were properly briefed and assisted during the fight and upon our arrival in Inchon. Departure from Inchon to Las Vegas was on time. 

In both segments of our flight, aircraft was clean, including restrooms, and service was efficient. Our seats have enough legroom and our individual entertainment came with good selections of programs. Food is better than other airlines. 

Downside:  Inchon to Las Vegas is a 10-hour flight. Dinner was served after taking off from Inchon and breakfast came two hours before our arrival in Las Vegas. There was no snack served in between except for one round of drinks when most passengers were asleep and cabin lights were off. There were some snacks items available at the galley consisting of cakes, bananas, chips, etc. but were made available inconspicuously as though they were purposely being hidden from passengers.

Check in is usually trouble although I have had some problems over excess baggage but normally reach an amicable compromise, the in flight entertainment is usually varied enough to keep me occupied for the long haul flights my only gripe is the food it never varies from one flight to the next and the snacks suit a Korean taste not European.

Daylight from Sydney to London with included overnight stay in Incheon: What’s not to like?,Sydney,London,International,"Why have I not done this before: a family commitment in Scotland led to an online search for flights. Two 10-11 hour flights and an included overnight stay in Incheon looked good value. Economy class seats and meals were more than adequate (although Korean Air policy seems to be that alcohol is only offered on the first meal of the flight: this was breakfast out of Sydney). Service was friendly and efficient. Food was fine (including a large array of mid-flight snacks). The Russian woman next to me, speaking no English or Korean, was given both hot meal choices (being in the back row may have assisted this). She was very grateful. In flight entertainment was ok: views out of the window over the Pacific (day 1) and China and Siberia (day 2) were, at time, spectacular (with no grumpy demands to shut the blind). The supplied voucher (make sure you receive one if you book these flights... it takes just one phone call to the airline) leads to a long but fast queue at a hotel service desk - bus transfers to dinner, bed, breakfast in a brand new hotel in downtown Incheon. The only guests appeared to be Korean Air overnighters as the hotel and staff were “bedded in”. Time for a quick breakfast/walk before transfers back to the airport before midday connecting flights to Europe.

The food that was served was really good. 
You can aways ask for more food , as I 've seen other people  do.  Very generous.

Great,Seoul,Auckland,International,"Layout of this plane provided the most legroom and space I've had on any flight in a very long time, although the seats were not the most comfortable.  I always find it disappointing when they seat 3 people together and then have an empty row in front!  Unfortunately someone spotted this and moved before the flight took off, put their gear in the middle seat and then disappeared for most of the flight.  I should have moved more quickly, but I always thought you aren't supposed to change seats until after take off.
Service and food was good in the early part of the flight, but was the bare minimum after the flight went into ""sleep mode"".  I don't sleep much on flights and the in-flight entertainment was rather dire and limited.

The flight was really disrupted by numerous  requests from the captain for people to return to their seats due to turbulence, which was very minor.

We normally find flying a bit of a chore but we thoroughly enjoyed these flights.

The food was good, but all included white rice (which as a diabetic I can't eat), and most meals were Asian, even breakfast, which was in fact a dinner meal. The first time I have ever flown over (or at least close to) the North Pole- straight north from Atlanta, down through central Siberia, over the Gobi, into China, then straight east to Inchon to avoid NK.

"Excellent economy class seating, and great service",Los Angeles,Seoul,International,"My wife and I flew four segments on KAL, including round trip LAX to ICN on the A380.  This airline is one of few where economy seats have not had extra inches squeezed  out of them.  The seats were reasonably spacious, reclined, but felt a little hard on the derriere towards the end of a 10 hour flight. We sat in the rear cabin which is small and quiet, and close to two toilets but probably feels turbulence a little more than further up.  Service was outstanding, the cabin crew well presented, hard working and efficient.  Food choices and quality were good.   My biggest gripe with KAL is that for certain economy ticket classes, advance seat reservation is not possible until 24 hours before takeoff, even if we booked months in advance.  On all our four flights we were preassigned seats away from the aisle (aisle and middle is our preference).  It was a pain to go through the hoops required to get better seats.

Terrible Mistake KAL - Total disaster,Tokyo,Seoul,North Asia,"Terrible mistakes of reckless air attendant  completely ruined my tour.
I have never seen any air attendant as reckless as the KAL air attendant. 
There were 3 points what  KAL services did not meet passengers' needs at all.
(1) An Air attendance was totally reckless and poured a full glace of orange juice to my pants, as soon as KAL air attendants started beverage service. Still I do not understand why she did. There was no turbulence at all. (2) A Senior Attendant  turned up, quite some time later. - Wrong. The Senior Air Attendant and another junior Air Attendant  tried to persuade me that the air attendant made a mistake due to turbulence, although there was no turbulance at all, when the air attendant poured a full glass of orange juice to my shirt and pants. It was the most  terrible experience I have ever experienced - my whole tour history by air.  KAL had to admit its air attendant's total mistake immediately. KAL does not have any excuse at all. (3) Because my whole pants were wet, including under pants, the Senior air attendant told me that KAL would be paying for some compensation, but she did not specify the amount.  When my getting off from KAL aircraft, she gave me an envelope - only around USD 20, which is small amount, compared to the pain and stress caused by the reckless air attendant. In conclusion, KAL is totally lack of staff training + has to admit its attendant mistake immediately. I do not believe that all KAL Air Attendants are terrible or making mistakes, but even this sort of 1 terrible mistake is not allowed . There was no turbulence at all at the time of  the incident. Who will want to put up with more than 2 hours with total wet pants & under pants with USD 20? volunteer to suffer from the mistake by air attendant with USD 20? Airfare is far bigger amount, compared to the amount. The amount  is total unfair price for the pain and the stress caused by KAL. KAL may need to consider increasing the amount of compensation, when that sort of incident is caused by KAL Air attendant. In addition, it could have been totally disastrous, if the air attendant made a terrible mistake with hot coffee or tea.",October 2017,"November 25, 2017",1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

I'm 5'5 and don't struggle with limited space on flights, so I had plenty of legroom in my window seat. The customer service was impeccable. Flight attendants made sure we were constantly fed and hydrated about every hour. The food was good..they have 3 options for each meal (I.e Chicken and rice, dim sum, sandwich, pizza) There are USB outlets for charging your electronics as well.

My only complaint is limited entertainment. Because our flight was so long, I thought there could be more than 15-20 movies to choose from and the popular shows they offer only air 2 episodes of each. That being said, don't rely heavily on the movies and TV shows...just come prepared with your own.

Love the A380 bar,Seoul,Paris,International,"On my flight to Incheon I flew with Air France and on my return with Korea Air. And on this specific flight with the A380.

The moment that I boarded the plane I was welcomed by the lovely flight staff and was guided to my seat. The purser welcomed me on board. 

The food onboard was very good. Also no complains regarding the drinks. The crew was really on top of their game.

I never been on a plane that had its own bar, so I was looking forward to experience the Celestial bar. At the front of the plane there was is this small lounge where you can make your own drinks. And in the back of the plane there was the bigger bar which was staffed by a stewardess. 

The only small negative that I could find was the quite lack of movies on the inflight entertainment.

This was one of my worst airplane experiences ever,Singapore,Washington DC,International,"I had a pretty disappointing customer service experience with Korean Air. During the 13-hour leg of my Asia-USA flight I started feeling sick. I quickly looked for a barf bag in the seat pocket but there was nothing. I ended up vomiting all over myself. The flight attendant rushed to me but all she did was offer me a glass of water. At no point did the staff on the flight help or offer to help me with cleaning up myself, my seat, or the floor all of which were covered in vomit. I ended up scrubbing it myself with soapy paper towels that I got from the bathroom after waiting in line (while covered in vomit). I started feeling sick again so I called the flight crew asking for them to bring me a barf bag, but it turns out they didn't have any of them on the ENTIRE flight (again, 13 hours long, hundreds of people on board). So they brought me a duty free shopping bag. I threw up into it several more times and it was never replaced, I had to just keep using the same one. Again, yes, I realize that I could have incessantly pinged the flight crew with various requests like this but in retrospect, I was appalled that they did absolutely nothing proactive to help me. People getting sick on flights is common. They should still be treated like humans. I felt disgusted and lonely and really just horrible.

After I finally got off of that godforsaken plane, it also took 20 minutes for my baggage to arrive at baggage claim. I got home feeling possibly the most disgusting I have ever felt, and knowing that I'll never be able to stomach flying Korean Air again.

I was sick while in Singapore and I knew getting onto my flights that I was already dehydrated and unwell. This was a large part of why I ended up getting sick. But KA did nothing to help the matter. Meals and drinks were spaced at extremely strange intervals. A meal and one glass of beverage almost immediately upon boarding, then nothing for another 5 hours. This pattern continued on all of my flights. While I always had the option to request additional water and I take responsibility for that, I think the on-board service should have been more consistent. Even after I got sick those multiple times, I think I was offered a small glass of water maybe twice more.

There were a lot of positives, the special dietary meals were very appreciated, the check-in and boarding processes were always easy, counter staff were always helpful and courteous, Incheon Airport was VERY nice for a layover, and the tech support when I had a booking issue was also great. I cannot possibly give a favorable rating though due to the dehumanizing experience that I had on board the flight.",October 2017,"November 3, 2017",2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0

Comfortable even in economy??? Yes!,Sydney,London,International,"My partner (6'1"") and I recently flew to London from Sydney via Incheon in September 2017, mainly because the ticket price, which was quite comparable to other airlines' offers if not better, also included a complimentary overnight stay at a hotel.  (STPC -Stopover Paid by Carrier, which meant that our hotel accommodation was included AND received two meal vouchers per person).  Seeing that we don't like spending exhaustive hours flying direct to London/Europe/US East coast, we opted for Korean Air.  Wow!  

Price - we purchased in advance, so about AU$1400 including one-week stopover in Seoul on the way back.
Inflight service - prompt and courteous service by cabin crew was something you don't often see.  A call for service was met within seconds and with a smile.
Food - can you go wrong with Korean bibimbap?  (mind you, I could always eat more..)
Check-in - was a breeze, although passengers are allowed to queue up prior to boarding, which can be annoying.  That Korean Air could better manage.  
Leg room - we flew on A380s to London and ICN-SYD on a 747-800, both of which provided a lot of leg room for me for sure and left about 4-5 inches between seatback and my partner's knees.   
And STPC - I understand, the hotel one is allocated can be a lottery.  We were allocated a room at the 5 Star Incheon Grand Hyatt.  That was absolutely amazing!  I understand, sometimes passengers are put up at other nearby 3-4 star hotels. 
Inflight entertainment - We did four flights in one month.  Their system doesn't hold that many movies or TV programs so I had to ""ration"" my way through its slim pickings.

Free stopover was a godsend with a baby,Auckland,London,International,"Korean Air offer a world-class service considerably cheaper than many other airlines. Online booking is straightforward, although our flight times were changed slightly a couple of times between booking and departure, for the better, I should add. In flight, staff were very helpful, keen to help with the baby, and the food was excellent. A design flaw in the front row TV screens meant that the bassinet had to be dismantled every time my wife needed to get up from her seat, but I think this was only an issue on either the Boeing or the Airbus, can't remember which sorry. What made the flight really special was the free 5* stopover in Incheon at the airline's expense, including restaurant vouchers for dinner and breakfast in the hotel before being bussed back to the airport for our connecting flight.

Worsening Service on Korean Air,New York City,Seoul,International,"I was on a flight from New York JFK to Seoul Incheon on a business class. Following is my observation that I can no longer recommend business travelers in Korean Air. I was on A380 aircarft;
1. There is no in flight wi-fi service. During some 14 hour flight, I was totally blacked out with my office and outside world. 
2. Before the take off, it is common that the passenger are offered drinks but Korean Air do not offer alcoholic beverage service. KAL only offers water or juice. 
3. Now the world famous bi-bim-bob service in the flight is a joke to me. There are very little vegetable/beef topping and are not balanced that after mixing the topping with rice, I ended up eating mostly white rice bi bim bop. The same bi-bim-bop that I can eat in Seoul for a mere $5 is much better quality with a lot more kimchi and other side dishes. 
4. The wine glass during the meal time is notoriously tiny. It is only half the size of other US carriers. Even then, the crew members seldom come to refill the wine glass. 
5. KAL crew members must be trained to perform quick services so that they tend to take the not finished dishes away not even asking. 
6. Korean Air business class meal serving is the only business class meal service done in a push cart service. 
7. The toilet supplies are very scarce. I saw 3 tiny shaving creme, 1 very tiny Crest mouth wash and two rolls of about ¼ left toilet papers. 
8. Many of the crew members are not fluent in English speaking. 
9. In flight entertainment programs are poor. To begin with the Korean movie selection, there were only 4. I will have them all watched counting the return flight to US.

How in God's name are you not in top 5?,New York City,Hanoi,International,"I don't understand it but how is Korean air not in top 5 best airline? I flew with Cathay Pacific last year and they are number 4 in the world and I don't  think their service nor friendliness of staff is anywhere close to Korean's. I even paid 100 USD more just to fly with Korean just to see how their service was instead of returning to Cathay Pacific to same route.  I am glad I did because I got to experience the best flight to Vietnam ever. 

Food choices were excellent. .. 3 choices of meals.. slippers,  toothbrush, comb ..etc plus snacks and wine .. not only that but the food tasted great......in economy!!! and stainless steel cutlery.. their air stewards/ess were over to sweet and friendly . Their security checks were very thorough.. if anyone were to complian it would have been me because I was always at the counters the longest ..seems because I'm from the Caribbean  my passport was very strange.. Anyhow it didn't bother me too much because their service otherwise made up for it... hope by the next time I travel with them my passport will not be so strange anymore.

This airline was all about comfort and smooth ride with good leg room because I think I was the tallest person on the entire flight.
No delays..no lost baggage..no fuss over an extra pound or 2..every thing was perfect.

Usually you're served a drink and you're lucky to get a refill without asking.  The flight attendants kept coming around offering to refill your drinks.    Korea praises milk. They have flavored milks like banana or strawberry.  Although the airline only have plain white milk, if you enjoy milk, request it.  Seems it's pretty good.

3. Regular food is good and on top, I always order Korean style ramen as extra

Incredibly comfortable for a 13-14 hour flight.,Seoul,New York City,International,"This is an Airbus A 380-300 aircraft.  As with all large aircraft with close to 500 passengers, try to book a seat closer to the front for quicker deplaning.  For economy seating, the Korean A380 has comfortable seats.  This is important as it is a 13-14 hour flight.  The leg room (pitch) is ample.  I have long legs and find it comfortable as is the width.  If traveling with a companion, lift up the arm rest for more room.  The flight crew works in shift, so I found then always helpful and cheerful, not to mention impeccably dressed and groomed.  Two meal services, with a selection of meals surprisingly good, plus snacks and drinks throughout the flight.  The A 380 has a duty free shop in the rear of the plane, where you can view items and order.  Restrooms were periodically checked, cleaned and always well maintained.  The AV selection is old, old, old.  I take this flight regularly and it has not changed in years.  Please upgrade.  This was a transfer flight for us so we had to go thru transfer point which was quick and easy.  If you are not lucky to be in business or first class upstairs, I think you will find economy seating both comfortable and well served.",July 2017,"October 7, 2017",5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0
"Comfortable flight, accommodating service",Bangkok,Seoul,North Asia,"This is a Boeing 747-400 aircraft.  The departure and arrival was on time.  Some turbulence over the South China Sea, which is common.  The flight crew were very courteous and helpful.  They seem to carry out their service in a calm and professional manner.  The aircraft is comfortable, both in leg room (pitch) and width.  Tip:  take out all the booklets, magazines, duty free book, etc from the seat pocket, throw it in the overhead bin, and enjoy 1-2 inches more leg room.  As this was an over night flight, breakfast was served toward the end of the flight.  Food was acceptable.  AV selections have not changed in years.  This needs a make over.  Restrooms were always clean and stocked.  Flight is about 5 1/2 hours and due to meal service later in the flight, a better opportunity to catch some sleep.

Pleasant Staff,Hong Kong,Seoul,North Asia,"Seats are not as cramped as I expected. Everything was clean and no major dirty areas spotted.
Staff very pleasant and personable. They spoke in a nice tone and worked around in an unhurried manner. Some air stewardesses on other airlines do at times speak overly loud or they are simply robotic. On our flight, the KE cabin crew always carried a genuine smile on their face.
The toilets are very clean and I can see why becos the air stewardesses were very diligent in keeping it clean and tidy. During the 3 hours flight, they actually stood outside the toilets with cleaning agents in hand waiting to enter after a passenger emerged, to clean and wipe floor, replenish things etc before they allowed the next passenger to use it again.
Even on economy flight they use real cutlery and real crockery to serve our meal---not like some other airlines that use plastic cutlery + crockery. Yet we must admit that the KE food was not good, or to be honest, rather bad.

Sydney-Seoul-Zurich,Sydney,Zurich,International,"OK, but probably would not fly again.  We booked the tickets because they were approx $400 cheaper than Emirates per ticket and thought this was a good saving (put the savings towards better accommodation).  Flew Sydney-Seoul-Zurich and London-Seoul-Sydney.  Flight attendants were OK, but you got little service outside the scheduled meals.  Meals were OK, but not as good as other international airlines I have flown.  Probably had 25 movies with only 3 or 4 really interesting me; which is an issue when you have 4 sectors each of about 10-11 hours.  The other ""learning"" was we had a 23 hour layover in Seoul on the way over to Zurich; which was effectively the loss of a day because the airport hotel is to far out to visit Seoul so this means you waste a day of your holiday.  The flight back from London to Sydney had a 4 hour layover which was better; ideally I would like a 2 hour layover between flights; long haul is never fun but any more than 2 hours at the airport is a waste of time.",September 2017,"September 16, 2017",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0

Perfect flight,Busan,Tokyo,North Asia,"My flight back from Busan (PUS) to Tokyo (NRT) with Korean Airlines (KE) was on a 737-900, and I was seated in economy. 

PUS being a relatively small airport, the check-in and baggage dropoff was quick. Boarding was also in an orderly manner and efficient. I took seat 56D, an aisle seat one row in front of the last on the plane. 

For this seat, there was audio equipment in the above overhead bin, and space for carry-ons were limited. I placed my carry-on (a laptop bag), which left very little space. This would have been a problem if the plane were full. However,  luckily I was the only one in my row and no one was behind me, so I did not have to fight for bin space. 

The crew was extremely polite and respectful. For example, the cabin crew apologized to me that she might bother me when reaching into the overhead bin above to control the audio. I then simply moved to the middle seat so as not to bother her, with both aisle and window seats empty, as well as the seats behind me. I bet I had more space than the passengers in business class (well, at least in one direction  :) ).

I was also impressed that most of the cabin attendants spoke Japanese very well.

"If you're hoping to use your Skypass miles on an Korean Air alliance, think again",Washington DC,Honolulu,Domestic,"I earned more than 25,000 Skypass miles on Korean Air. Korean Air is one of the few airlines that considers HA and Alaska to be in the US for frequent flier miles. I tried to use them for a round trip to Hawaii. I was totally flexible about dates and using any of the three airports near me. After spending almost two hours on the phone, the hard working agent could come up with one flight to HA in April 2018 with a one-day layover in Salt Lake City. She could not find a single flight returning from HA to Washington DC or BWI in all of May. I spoke with a supervisor, to no avail. I wrote to the complaint department, to no avail. I wrote to the CEO of Korean Air (they sent me an application to Skypass Miles!). They all kept stating that their alliance partner Delta doesn't give them very many seats (as in ""none""). I don't think there is any point in using Korean Air if you're hoping to use their Skypass miles. Clearly Korean Air chooses to not negotiate well with Delta.

Uneventful but pleasant flight,Tokyo,Busan,North Asia,"I flew from Tokyo (NRT) to Busan (PUS) on Korean Airlines. The aircraft was a 737-900, and I was seated in economy. 

I checked in using one of their check-in machines at NRT, and the luggage dropoff was also via a cool automated machine. Everything went smooth, and I was heading to security in 15 minutes. 

The boarding process was also very smooth, and I could even say impressive. Perhaps this was because the flight was only half full, but the lines were well organized. At boarding, the cabin crew were welcoming and very polite. 

The seats are pretty narrow in economy, and I am saying this at a height of 170 cm. The distance between my knee and the seat in front of me was 5 cm. Luckily, I was able to grab an empty row at the back of the plane. 

Lunch was served, even for a sub-two-hour flight. I was expecting a Korean dish with hot paste on the side, but what came out was a Western style grilled chicken with rice and vegetables. Not super delicious, but good enough, especially for a cheap ticket (less than CA$300 round-trip).

"Great airline - plenty of leg room, good service and cheap fares!",Sydney,Vancouver,International,"We flew from Sydney to Vancouver return via Incheon Airport with one night stay at an airport hotel (free shuttle) both ways to break up the long flight. We were amazed at how comfortable it was - we choose a 2 seat row at the back and found plenty of leg room. My husband actually could get out without me getting up!! There is direct train service to Seoul if you want to get there. 1-5 hours free tours if you have time during transfers so check it out when you book your flight. Great shopping at Lotte in Unseo (2 train stops away by subway) at 1000 won single trip. A deposit of 500 won when you purchased your ticket and you get refund by inserting ticket after you get out on vending machines. Hotels are cheap in South Korea so may be consider spending more days there before your ongoing journey.  

Only draw back is if you book with your credit card, they need you to verify it on departure by showing your credit card in person (which does not let you do on-line check-in). I believe you don't have to do it if you use a travel agent or if you use visa cards, then you can verify it on line during purchase. I found it quite a nuisance using our Amex card as most people will book on-line using a credit card.

Korean Air Unaccompanied Minor Service (YVR-ICN-VVO),Vancouver,Vladivostok,International,"My kids were flying with Korean Air from Canada to Russia via Incheon and back. The service was amazing! (Just call the airline to book a ticket and service, that way everything will be done faster and easier). The kids (or adults requiring help) are taken from the airline counter right to the gates. During the layover, accompanying airline personnel gave me a call to let me know that kids were picked up and what time is the next flight, and I also could talk to the kids. They always check who is sitting next to minors during the flight. Also, flight attendant responsible for the child(ren), prepares a letter called ""Letter from the Flying Mom"", where the flight and kid's  experience is described. That letter is really cute and a very thoughtful gesture! 
Korean Air personnel was always nice over the phone, they always phoned and confirmed all the details. When I mentioned that because of the time difference I was not able to take the call (waiting for the UM Service request approval status), airline personnel made a note about that, and instead of calling sent a text message next time, which I really appreciate, that was nice of them.

Pleasant surprise!,Brisbane,Vancouver,International,"Never flown with them before, and the only reason we did was that they were about $7000 cheaper than Canadian, which does not get the best reviews online.

Pleasantly surprised with the truly lovely service, superb food, the beef out of Brisbane cooked to order and very comfortable flat bed with every seat having isle access. Great champagnes, wines and spirits in board as well.

The only down side was the lounge at Brisbane was the plaza lounge which was not great. If you are looking for leather seats or gold and teak trims look elsewhere at SQ or EK. But I am thrilled I saved 7K and had a solid experience.

If flying across the pacific and they keep their fares this cheap will for sure fly with them again.

Superb economy class experience,Sydney,London,International,"We, a family of four flew from Sydney to London via Incheon. Every moment of this trip was a pleasure. Korean offers one of the widest economy seats in the market with no under seat box to block your feet. I am over six foot and even when the seat in front was reclined my knees were no where near the back of the seat in front. 

The crew speak English very well and are immaculately presented. They are friendly and very efficient. They keep the aircraft spotless and are stationed outside the toilets for the entire flight to keep them clean and stocked. The toilets include first class toiletries, for example L'Occitane moisturiser. The food is spectacularly good if you choose their signature bibimbap which looks and tastes nothing like airplane food. Other choices are more standard airline fare. 

The entertainment is presented on a large seat back screen and although not as extensive as some offers a classy choice of movies and shows including some unexpected classics and also some interesting international options. Children are provided with special headsets so they don't fall off. The kids' pack includes pencils and activities ( and on the return flight a cuddly toy) 

This route included a stopover hotel in Incheon included in the price. Our hold luggage was checked right through. So we didn't have to grapple with bags etc. The hotel is not revealed until you arrive, but for us was the Grand Hyatt. Incredible service and quality which became a major part of the holiday. There was no stop over on the return flight. 

Through this trip we flew on three aircraft types. The A380 was spectacularly good, very quiet and calm and has a duty free shop on board. The 747 was noisier and older, but had been retrofitted and the seating was of the same quality. The smaller airbus (330?) was very modern and quiet. 

This was the best economy flight I have ever been on and also the best value. I would absolutely not hesitate to recommend Korean and would definitely fly with them again.",May 2017,"August 31, 2017",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,
Always solid service.,Columbus,Bangkok,International,"I noticed on my ticket that this is the 14th time I've flown Korean Air to Asia, so I have some experience on which to base an opinion.   All these flights have been economy except for this latest, which was a heavenly business class ticket.  If you can afford it, get the upgrade!  But I can say that, even in economy class, the KAL folks are exceptionally nice and work hard to please.  Food is also good - especially if you're willing to go with the Asian dishes.  Anyway, no need to go on here - KAL will be my choice whenever possible.  You can usually get a competitive price with them and the Seoul airport, if your routed that way, is super.",August 2017,"August 31, 2017",5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
That Korean Touch,Hong Kong,Seoul,North Asia,"Korean Air (KE) operates several flights a day from Hong Kong (HKG) to Seoul-Incheon. All flights are on widebody planes, but the J class product may vary according to plane type. 

I recently flew KE on the above route, Prestige Class, in the Prestige Sleeper. The seat is certainly acceptable for a 3 hour flight, but real long haul, make sure you try to book with their most updated Prestige Class. 

Ground staff at HKG were very swift and pleasant. HKG is so efficient so security and immigration take no time. As a business class flyer, you're afforded entrance to the SkyTeam Lounge. While not as sophisticated as Cathay's lounges, this common-use area is a definite update from the previous KE Lounge. The place can fill up due to other Skyteam carriers using it too but I managed to find a seat. There's a spread of Asian/HKG-inspired food - including a noodle bar. After firing off a few emails, and imbibing on a glass of red, I made my way to the gate. 

Boarding commenced on time and KE invited those who needed assistance as well as first class and high-tiered elites. Afterwards, us business class folk and Morning Calm members boarded. Upon reaching the door, KE flight attendants bowed and welcomed all onboard. I settled into my seat 10A; you do have someone next to you. Seats are positioned in a 2-3-2 layout. Unlike JAL's layout, those by the window or in the center have to jump over their neighbor. 

Once settled FA s came around with welcome drinks including champagne. They also took lunch orders; the menu included their classic bimbimbap and a western meal - I chose the former. 

Since it was a relatively short flight, FA s were swift in setting up tables and pouring drinks. Meals were served right away. Dessert consisted of either fruit or haagen daz ice cream. They then served coffee or tea. 

The inflight entertainment is a bit of a letdown. The content is limited; however, there are new releases, but I'm not really into watching Batman fight Superman. 

Eventually, we began our descent in Incheon. We disembarked quickly. Unfortunately, quick wasn't the case for Seoul immigration, but that's a whole other story. 

All in all, a solid experience given the short flight time of 3 hours. I paid USD$400 one way; not too bad all things considered.",August 2017,"August 31, 2017",4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,,,

Would you like some beer instead?... I'd asked for beer if I wanted to). An then the cherry on the cake - you have to deplane via stairs instead of aerobridge.

"Small seats, clean environment, yummy food",Salt Lake City,Taipei,International,"This was my first time flying Korean Air. Overall it was a great flight. 

The food was actually quite delicious (Korean Bibimbap for dinner, pasta and literally the best carrot cake I've ever had for breakfast): warm, not soggy, and good flavor, although the bread was a bit dry. The flight was very clean, with the stewardesses folding up the the toilet paper ends into neat triangles every chance they got. It was very impressive. 

Economy had private tv screens that worked quite well and had a good variety of new and old movies, games, tv shows, etc. The touch screens were a bit difficult to use, but they were in working order. Other amenities included paper slippers(thick enough to not get too wet), toothbrush and toothpaste (awesome for the long flights), and the regular blanket/pillows. 

I'm on the overweight side, (5'5 230 lbs) and the seats, although small were fairly comfortable. If you're over my measurements, I'd say it would be a lot more uncomfortable, maybe find another airline, or upgrade, but for me it really wasn't that bad. The legroom seemed pretty standard for Economy, maybe a bit on the small side compared to western airlines. I'm not very tall but my legs were constantly touching the back of the seat in front. I can't sleep on planes anyway since they're all uncomfortable to me, but it was very quiet and they make it quite dark.

Great flight.,Sydney,London,International,"I would highly recommend flying with Korean Air if you are travelling from Australia to Europe. Not only are the staff lovely and helpful, and the plane comfortable and clean, but the flight makes an overnight stop in Seoul. Because the stop-over is a long one, the airline puts you up in a hotel for the night and gives you meal tickets so that you can have dinner and breakfast at the hotel. BUT! They will ask if you want to be in a hotel attached to the airport or one further away. Choose the one further away. First, there is a quick shuttle ride between the airport and the hotel so you don't have to worry about travel. Second, the hotel is a Grand Hyatt and is a beautiful hotel. 
The food on the flight was also very good. I would suggest ordering the Korean option (if it is to your taste) as it is usually much better quality in comparisson to the Western mean. I thoroughly enjoyed the bibimbap on multiple occassions. The standard snack on the flight is cup noodle (and who doesn't love cup noodles?!) but they are very spicy, so if you are like me and don't handle spice very well, keep that in mind.

An Okay Airline!,New York City,Manila,International,The flight was 14 hours from JFK to Incheon. The seats (economy) are not comfortable for this long travel. The food was great but you have to ask for snacks when you're hungry because they don't automatically give it out like other airlines. The customer service is just okay too. I guess they don't cater to economy passengers too much. My kids are 15 and 17 but they still sat us around little children as young as infants and toddlers - we didn't find out till we get inside the cabin. It was hard to get some sleep when the younger kids are crying and playing around. So I guess it is a planning on their part. They should sit us with other adults because we paid adult fares for my 15 & 17 years old. 4 hours later of another Korean flight to Manila -- I couldn't feel my whole body because of fatigue for not getting any rest on the plane.,July 2017,"August 29, 2017",5.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,5.0

At frankfurt, it was really exhausting because the train station connects directly to the terminal 1 whereas the korean air is at terminal 2, so that was the downside.

Flight Frankfurt to Incheon... the usual standard... as always,Frankfurt,Seoul,International,"After flying more then 55 times Frankfurt-Incheon v.v. only with this Airline, i was disappointed at the check-in in Frankfurt to be put in a 4 seat row at the almost total end of the economy class (Row 62).
Knowing well that isle seat is generally preferred (we are not allowed to travel Business or Prestige Class, unless free-of-charge upgrade, due to company policy). No flexibility was shown after request to change to another row or isle seat at time of check-in. (Means in my opinion the holiday traveller is prioirised above freguent business  traveller). Don't get me wrong, I normally am very satisfied with this Airline and Service (enough leg space and good food choice, even in economy class) but this should have been done better.
Lately i registered during the last 7-8 flights a higher frequency of turbulences during the flight. If this is due to weather conditions?!? For the rest the in-flight Crew was friendly as always, the service was okay, we had a delay at departure but the delay was well covered by choosing the right air stream to catch up some time by the pilots.

that seat should not exist, really.

747-8 Economy on Korean Air is best for its fare,San Francisco,Seoul,International,"As always, Korean Air has a fantastic in-flight service. I have been flying them once a year and service has been impeccable despite it being the cattle class. Food is above average if you order the right thing...Can't go wrong with bibimbap and rice porridge. As for western food options, I'd pass as they taste like frozen meals. Flight attendants are always helpful no matter how busy they get, unlike UA(worst major carrier in my opinion). The only thing I would like to see them improve is inflight entertainment as options are quite scarce compared to that of Singapore Air. The aircraft they employ for one of the daily flights is 747-8 which has an excellent pitch(33~34 in) for an economy class. There is something mystical(?) about this 747 aircraft and I enjoy flying in it just as much as an Airbus A380. I would love to upgrade to ride 1st class on this plane before it is phased out.

The one gripe we do have is in the Seoul to Auckland leg. For the last 2 times of travel, we have found the Business Class seats to be average at best on the 777and the last cabin configuration to be ""anti social"". I do believe Korean Air need to look at the standard for this leg as it falls short of the brilliant layout in the A380 Seoul to Paris and return.

The double decked Airbus 380 serviced the 14 hours non-stop from JFK to ICN.  Notwithstanding, the lengthy flight, I arrived relaxed.

One of the world's best airlines,Washington DC,Qingdao,International,"I have been flying internationally to Asia for years and Korean Air is consistently the best airline I've ever flown. Even in economy class I have plenty of room, more than on any other airline I can think of. The food service was great and the choices were very good. I especially appreciated the low fat option, but I had to choose that ahead of time when I reserved my seat. One of my daughters chose the vegetarian option as one of her meals (online several weeks before the flight) and was very pleased with her selection. The kid's meal for my younger daughter was also excellent. Snacks are always available and I took advantage of that once during my flight. Service was always fast and friendly. Entertainment options were more than enough to keep our family of 4 entertained throughout the flight. The 10 inch touch screen on the back of the seat in front of me was more than adequate to prevent eyestrain and make movies or games enjoyable. The only downside to many flights to and from the US on Korean Air is the 19 hour layover in Incheon, Korea. While there's no other airport in the world I'd rather have to wait for a flight, it does get long. Also, booking early usually means prices are very competitive with other airlines. You still may pay a little extra, but when you're locked in a tube at 30,000+ feet for 14 hours you'll find it's worth every penny!",August 2017,"August 28, 2017",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Three of the flights were fine in terms of seat comfort--I could fully lie down and try to sleep.  One of them, however, was not really very comfortable. It was more like a regular seat. I am short so the seat just didn't hit me in the right places. The flight attendants, for the most part, were efficient and competent. On one of the 14-hour flights, I was served all the water I craved and all the wine I needed to be able to sleep. On the other flights, however, the flight attendants just disappeared after the main meal was served.  Check-in and boarding procedures were first-rate on all flights.

They don't get some people can't handle such the peppery spicy foods. On long haul flights, snacks are dismally sparse to the point, I feel they are quite stingy on the food.

Korean Air is Phenomenal,Los Angeles,Singapore,International,"I have been flying from the United States on Korean Air to Singapore, as well as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, since 2012. Although during that time I have tried two other airlines, in my experience, Korean Air is as good as you can get for these long flights. 

I fly coach/economy class because that is all the universities for which I teach will authorize. Seat comfort and leg room are critical in this section of the plane. I have always had plenty of room and comfortable seats. Most planes are new, or the interiors have been updated, so all of the needed accommodations are there, including large sharp video screens and power for devices. There are more good movies than you could watch, even on a 14-hour flight.

The food has always been excellent. Wine and other drinks are plentiful. The cabin crew are friendly and helpful. There really is nothing missing. Every flight has been fantastic.

If you travel regularly, as I do, with at least one trip to Asia each year, you will earn enough points to get four uses of the Korean Air Lounges that you can use over a two-year period. That means a comfortable place to wait between flights, plus food and drinks while waiting. If you don't travel enough to earn the points, there still is an excellent lounge in the Korean Air terminal at the Seoul/Incheon terminal that you can use for $21.00 by showing your Korean Air boarding pass.

Service is 5-star, food is 5-star, and who cant say no to a shaken cocktail served in a true martini glass (which is actually a bad idea in any sort of turbulence).

Twice is more than enough,Los Angeles,Bangkok,International,"Twice I had to fly Korean Airline.  From LAX to Korea, it would be an airbus, and a regular 747 from Korea to Bangkok.  First of, services between the two air crafts are very different, almost like a comparison of shopping at Macy's vs. Saks Fifth Avenue.  Why is that?  Both of the flights are the same airline, the same owner.  That's not enough, flight attendants especially the female attendants the service is a bit robotic or communist.  A smile is difficult to come out, a friendly service is sometime unnoticeable.  To be fair, I think they are under a lot of pressure by Korean standard.  They try too hard and; at the end, it feels stiff and awkward.  The way they speak to passengers, there's a huge different between Korean and English.  It's soft tone in Korean, but when it comes to English, it feels like they are yelling at you.  A training class in English might be helpful, perhaps.  Food and beverage is just average and the taste is so-so.  
If you ever fly with EVA, it's a different experience, I hate to use that as a comparison.  However, to prove my point one must be addressed.  I will not address much with EVA since this is all about Korean Airline.  I have privilege to use airline lounge on both airlines, way different.  For KAL, if you're not Korean, prepare for that robotic, unfriendly tone of voice.  They don't smile at you and they speak as though they have a bad day!

I've just talked to a friend who travel to Asia a lot.  So, I mentioned KAL, the answer I get back is similar to what I've observed.  My friend even asked me, ""Why did you fly KAL?""

As for myself from now on, KAL is not an acceptable choice any longer until that reputation has been fixed.  I hardly feel welcome, both at the KAL lounge and in flight!",August 2017,"August 28, 2017",3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,3.0

I had fairly enough room to move around which is importance as I'm a large guy (5'9, 215 lbs). The leg space was great as well considering I had a bag near my feet. I would definitely use them again.

Thankfully I was able to request a gluten free meal before the flight, and the airline staff confirmed my meal choice during check-in, and again at the start of the flight. Sure enough, they brought (tasty) gluten free meals during the flight as requested.

Also - since I did have a special meal request, they brought my meal out first before others were served. If you hate having to wait for meal service to get to you - perhaps requesting a special meal will help you get your meal quickly.

Perhaps I should not be so impressed by people doing what they say they will do, but since you have very few options while in the air, I appreciated the attention to detail and their accommodation of my dietary needs.",May 2017,"August 28, 2017",5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0

I have flown of 500,000 miles with KAL and they remain my first choice whenever possible.

I fly Korean Air most of the time and I must say I had the best experience with them, compare to other airlines.

Average company,Sydney,London,International,"We decided to travel Korean Air after reading some good reviews. Indeed is far to be a bad company but is also not the greatest. Positives: as we had an involuntary 20 hour stopover they put us on a hotel close to the airport with all meals and transport included. We arranged that before departure. Leg space was good and meals were also good having average 3 options to choose from. Crew was nice and very punctual with take off and landing. 
Negatives: on both flights(sydney-seoul and seoul-london) the entertainment options were exactly the same which were not that vast making me use my own ipad for entetainment,when you are on a 20 something hour flight you need more options. Also there were no drinks served with second meal in both flights. On a 12 hour flight we had only 2 meals and a tiny slice of pizza.

I once had to make, not joking, 10 calls to book a flight. They have several, unnecessarily complicated systems in place that don't work well together.

Do not fly on Korean Air if you are Delta Skymiles or Aeroflot Bonus member,New York City,Taipei,International,"You must know cons with Korean Air that Korean Air does not want you to know:
Miles earning issue: Korean Air and Delta / Aeroflot partnership on mileage is lousy and really really bad for Delta Skymiles and Aeroflot Bonus frequent flyers. I spent a lot of money on the ticket on Korean Air and I got ZERO miles from my past flights in my Skymiles account. Korean Air gives 100% miles and friendly earning miles for local domestic flyers who are loyal with Skypass who live and work in South Korea. Korean Air is not ideal and not friendly for these international flyers who have different frequent memberships. DO NOT fly on Korean Air if you are not Skypass frequent member. It is not worth.
Bad check in procedure: Skymiles Priority member is not recognized at check in of the Korean Air counter at JFK airport. Korean Air rejected Skymiles Priority members and Skyteam Priority members. 
Inflight service: Flight attendants are dissemblers and not authentic with international passengers who are not Korean. They demonstrated fake politeness. They do not love and do not like tourists. 
Meal service: It was good like Air France or Aeroflot (Skyteam partners)
Inflight entertainment: It was good enough with different options
Big minus: Long haul flight did not give us a chance to exercise. My legs and back were cramped. 
Seat cushion was not really good. It was close to poor design and cushion.",June 2017,"August 15, 2017",2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0

Our pleasant trip started with our comfortable stay in the spacious KAL Lounge at Incheon International Airport. The lounge was well appointed and well stocked with assortments of drinks, snacks and light breakfast items. Going through the boarding gate was smooth and quick, using the dedicated Sky Priority line and walkway which lead straight to the upper level business class cabin. 

The cabin was spacious and pristine, and the flight attendants and officers were very courteous and efficient. Flatbed seats were very comfortable, and crews' in-flight service, meals, drinks, and entertainments were great. What impressed us most was the way flight attendants tended to the passengers needs even by kneeling themselves in front of the passengers to listen to their requests. 

While the passengers were sleeping during the long flight, the flight attendants were frequently and quietly pacing back and forth the isles to make sure the passengers were comfortable.

I liked the leg room they offered for Economy. There was a bottle of water, a pair of slippers and a set of a tooth brush and a tooth paste. 
The flight attendants were very nice and polite, I lost count how many times they approached us in Korean.
The food selections were pretty good and my husband loves Korean food, as for me I wasn't a big fan of airline food so I requested a cup of instant noodles. However, I did enjoy some of their snacks.

Poor seat design but Seamless service,Seoul,Toronto,International,"My flight actually started from Sydney Australia transiting Incheon onwards to Toronto. Although I was on different aircraft types , A330 departing Sydney and  B787 from Incheon, my comments apply to both legs.

Service was excellent and seamless including the transfers to and from the layover hotel Grand Hyatt.  Once you found their service desk outside customs, a staff would escort you to the shuttle stop.  A room at the hotel was already available upon arrival and free dinner and breakfast were included.  These were most welcoming and assuring after a long flight.
Cabin crew was very courteous and helpful.  Response to calls were almost immediate.  They were among the very few airlines where hostesses would assist me in putting my cabin bags up to the overhead locker (without having to wait for the availability of a male attendant.  Given that I am of medium height with a weak arm and back, I give them a heartfelt thank!!
As for seating, and amenities they were good enough except I found insufficient storage space for my book, iPad and other personal things. Slippers were provided but no socks.  Hence having had previous  experience with this airline I brought my own airline socks.  I would advise those who have cold feet to do likewise especially with long hauls.
Going on to the food.  A few years ago when I first flew with them I found them different and interesting.  However, after about 3 years, the menus looked exactly the same on these flights!  Hopefully I will be given something different on my way back home in 2 weeks!
Entertainmentwise, the number of movies and TV shows were quite limited, (say as compared to Emirates, Qantas and Cathay).  I am hoping that on my way home in early August, some new titles would have been added as I had viewed all those that were of interest to me on the last trip!

A380 flight on KE to Paris from Incheon,Seoul,Paris,International,"Recently purchased or leased airplanes by Korean Air have different seating arrangement especially for the business and first class.  Airbus 380 has the business class seating only on the upper deck of the airplane and by 2-3-2 layout. More recent airplanes like Airbus 330-300, Boeing 747-8i or Boeing 777-300ER have a better seating arrangement for the business class with suite; so, it is arranged in 1-2-1, allowing more private and direct access to the isle for all the seats.
However, despite of slightly inferior seating arrangement and comfort, airbus 380 generally is more quite and a bigger with more lounges on the upper deck.  
If you are seating on window seat, you have to cross over the person on the isle seat if on flat bed mode during sleeping during the flight.
Compared to the other airlines, especially US carriers, foods on any long international flights are much much better on Korean Air or Asiana Airlines.  You can taste the healthy Korean cuisine on the flight!!!  Even the crews on the flight are much professional with courtesy compared to the indifferent and rude attitude of the western carriers!
This flight was quite comfortable with enough inflight entertainment program on board.
Since the upper deck is solely dedicated to the business class passengers, even the restrooms are bigger and better.

"OK, just not great food",Los Angeles,Manila,International,"Tried Korean Air for the first time on a trip from LA to Manila.  Compared to most airlines they are priced reasonably, not too expensive but not that cheap.  The seats are spacious enough, I am 5'4"" and not heavily built and felt comfortable enough.  Baggage and carry-on allowance is also good.  Flight entertainment was also good, I mean having VOD should be standard by now.  The FA's were polite and courteous though I was rudely woken by one when they were serving breakfast.  The food selection needs to be improved.  Out of a total of 3 meals served on my LA to Manila flight, they offered bibimbap and beef pasta for 2 of those meals!! No variety, it was always either bibimbap or beef pasta.  The food is really not good!  I'm used to airline food so it's not like I'm expecting gourmet, but the food Korean Air served was just not even up to par with what most airlines have.  Would I fly again?  Not too sure when I'm willing to pay the extra dollars to fly on better airlines like Cathay Pacific.",June 2017,"July 11, 2017",3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0

I waited two hours in line, which was where the departures screen said to be, before finally being told that I had missed my flight and they had changed the check in counter shortly after I had arrived due to the crowd from this celebrity.

Plenty of space in overhead storage. Blankets and pillows are placed on every seat. For long legs and wide stomachs the seating space is decent. The food and beverages are tasty to me and at NO additional cost (not sure about alcohol).  On longer flights (10 plus hours) you are offered meal selection; on shorter flights you are given a standard Korean meal, unless diet restrictions are noted during ticket purchasing. The entertainment system is great! Plenty of movies to choose from - classic and latest blockbusters - as well as game and music options. Average headphones are provided. The TV screen displays the safety procedures in case of a flight emergency in several languages (Korean, English, Chinese, Spanish and more depending on the destination). Each time I fly with this airline we arrive at least 10 minutes early, even if we do not leave on time. This is a bonus when you have to wait in line at customs, post flight and want to get to your hotel/hostel asap. I do not check bags, so I cannot speak to whether bags get lost.

Leg room: VERY SPACIOUS. It was very spacious, that it's wide enough that I can't reach the touch screen monitor when I am seated. You can lay down as flat as you want. They have slippers provided as well.

Food: KOREAN FOOD. Bibimbap is on the menu, though I think you have reserve that since bibimbap tends to run out fast.

Staff: Very helpful and attentive. Whenever my water starts to go below half, a flight attendant comes by to refill it. Every time!!

Their image inspired confidence, professionalism, and a great experience. The media service offered all that one needs. I would take this flight over again without a moment's hesitation! The only challenge or downside was that the airline would not sell an upgrade because my ticket was under the code of a partner airline, not theirs.

The seats are as comfortable as Economy Class seats can be, but it's the service that really sets this airline apart from the rest. The flight attendants are friendly and efficient, and the food offerings are quite good. The only downside is that, for a 14 hour flight, snacks are not readily available. Cathay Pacific, for instance, leaves sandwiches and instant noodles out for passengers to help themselves; Korean Air seems to have nothing available (if they do, the passengers would have no way of getting them as the kitchen is curtained off).

Even in an  economy we have enough leg room that we didn't feel too cramped up.
The only downside was, there were three of us travelling (my family) and we had an extra 1 small box and yet the check in counter was so strict to not allow it even if our total number of kilos didn't exceed yet.

We were taken care of very well throughout our trip and especially enjoyed the privileges of our Morning Calm status. Check-in was speedy and efficient. Our flight left a few minutes late from Qingdao, but that's a common experience in China. Meals were delicious and I especially enjoyed the low fat menu, which is just one of the many options you can select online when you purchase tickets.  We fly with children and they were dealt with kindly and respectfully during the entire flight. The entertainment center on the back of the seats provided a large screen and a wide selection of current movies. There were plenty of other options such as games and music. Even in economy class the seats are great! There's plenty of leg room and you don't feel crowded by your seatmates. Being able to choose seats ahead of time online is great. Our layover was a bit long - 19 hours, but there's not much that can be done about that because of flight times. Incheon airport is a great place to layover in. There's plenty of shopping, decent restaurants, and the cultural center is a nice way to pass the time. Our bags were handled carefully and there was no damage - never has been with Korean Air.

Only One luggage allowed for check in on Economy,Singapore,Seoul,North Asia,"This is my first time flying Korean Air on Economy. I booked this airline as it was the cheapest direct flight I can find during my travel period in late May from SG. Was pleasantly surprised their meal options have 3 choices instead of the usual two that you have in many other airlines. We chose the bibimbap which was very nice. Inflight entertainment was touch screen and screen size is ok but the variety is not much to select. Crew was attentive and professional.  

Note: Not sure if it was due to my fare option, the max weight for check in luggage is only 23 kg. I was told during flight check in that I can only check in One single piece of luggage and any other add-on is at S$100 per piece even though my single luggage may not add to 23kg! I brought only a 21"" and thought I can add in another (if too much shopping) to add all up to 23kg, but not unless I pay! Lucky my sis brought a bigger one at 26"" for check in. 

Overall, I will choose Korean Air again but bring a bigger luggage to max out the weight limit. However, if you intend to shop a lot, this flight option might not be for you as max weight is only 23kg with One luggage compared to other airlines' 28kg or 30kg that allowed 2-3 pieces of combined luggages instead.",May 2017,"June 27, 2017",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

Travel to Italy with a Stopover,Brisbane,Rome,International,"I'm in my late 60's now and although I've done numerous long distance flights over the past 45 years I find it gets increasingly difficult to face it as I get older. Whenever we travel to Rome to visit our daughter and her husband we always choose Korean Air due to the fact that they travel to Seoul (Incheon Airport) from Brisbane and stopover for almost one day in a nice hotel near to the airport.

We've done this on a couple of occasions and absolutely love it. A short 10 hour flight then off to the hotel via the bus that's provided and have a nice buffet dinner all included in the price of the ticket before settling in to a glorious rest. Breakfast is also buffet style and is more than adequate before boarding the bus around 10 AM for the return to the airport. 

The flight (KE 0931) departs at 13:45 and arrives in Rome twelve hours and forty minutes later at 7:35 PM. We arrive feeling relatively refreshed and get to meet up with our daughter for a few vinos and a snack before going to bed at the usual hour. There's absolutely no jet lag at all.

We highly recommend this to all travelers heading this way. 

Unfortunately, the return leg does not offer a stopover as it did in the past. There's approximately a four hour wait in Incheon before doing the final leg home. Instead of doing it that way, my wife and I did a four day stopover at Myeongdong shopping district in Seoul.",September 2016,"June 27, 2017",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0

Got me from Point A to Point B,Los Angeles,Seoul,International,"The aircraft was new and spacious as Airbus A380's can be, though the seats were a little bit cramped as most commercial airlines are. The in-flight service was efficient if impersonal. 

However, the whole experience doesn't project the generosity and caring one would get with other Asian airlines - Singapore, Cathay, Thai, even Philippines. The meal portions are meager - their bi bim bop is a fraction of what I get in a small Korean place I go to and much less appetizing.

For me, the company has failed the test of comfort, exclusive service, attention to details, entertainment, food, etc. 

The crew was nice, but..

I was sad to see that a big company like KA cannot afford to enrich the movie catalogue, and there was no addition of movies, though I flew the first leg 4th of May and the return flight was 25 May!  

The food was simply not an event, no richness in the offering, cold pastry, limited choices, and you feel the crew not able to propose something more.

However, the fact about requesting for kids meal is not very clear and we are not aware of the proper procedure and timing to request for it. further, there are no spare sets though my girl dont feel like eating those normal food. perhaps due to communication problem, in our next flight, I had consciuosly remembered that we need to request it from the airline and we understood from the air stwedress that it can only be done within 24hour of the flight as we cant make too advance request. however, when we make the request, we are told that it was too late.

I felt I was in a historical Korean drama - me being the princes and the cabin attendant my servant. This kind of elegance and courtesy are very hard to find with flight attendants of other airlines. The drink and food were served together shortly after take-off. The flight attendants kept asking us if we wanted more drinks. One of the most memorable things about the flight attendants of this very flight was that a few of them remembered me flying with them from Inchon on the way to Fiji.

Towards the end of the flight, around dinner time, we were served another meal but this time no wine was available.

For this second meal they could not offer me any choice and what was on offer did not appeal. I asked if there were any sandwiches or snack food I could have instead. No, there was nothing. In the end I made a sandwich from the salad and bread roll.

Best airline experience in 30+ years!,Houston,Seoul,International,"My wife, 2 sons, and I just returned from a 10-day/9-night roundtrip flight to Seoul.  Between business and personal travel, I fly 6-12 times per year, and have flown to Seoul before.  My previous travel has been exclusively on Continental/United, Northwest/Delta, American, and Southwest - all Economy class.  This was my first flight on an international airline, which I scheduled at my father's suggestion, based upon his extensive business travel experience.  I was very impressed!  From the impeccable appearance and professionalism of the airport staff, flight crews, and cabin crews, to the better than average legroom and width of the seats, to the surprisingly good food (chose Korean food on both flights), we had terrific experiences.  Our flights were serviced with Boeing 777-200 aircraft.  When I booked, I did reserved a full row (three seats) on one side of the aircraft, with one seat just across the aisle in the same row, so we were ideally situated in terms of flexibility.  Also, staff were diligent and attentive in maintaining restrooms throughout the flights, which I recall being some issue with past airlines.

Overall, while the level of product, service, and quality has steadily decreased with US-based carriers over the years (not including Southwest, which has maintained a solid performance), Korean Air showed that you can still provide excellent service in Coach.  Given my experience, Korean Air will, without question, be our obvious choice for future travel to Seoul.  

One note - Boarding process in Houston was very efficient and well-planned, and we boarded in a timeline fashion.  Boarding in Korea was less efficient, but appeared to be so due to airport gate layout, which was not as open as was in Houston.

Also of note, our regular coach ticket included two 50lb bags each (no extra fee), and no extra fee for window or aisle seats, of which we had 3 of 4 of our tickets.  No nickel and diming.  Ticket was about double of what I could have booked with United or American, but that would have included other fees, as well as a stop/layover in another US city.  Flying direct was more comfortable and more enjoyable.

Another note - I noted that another review was negative regarding crying children.  Overseas flights such as this include adoptions and families travelling to reunite with other family overseas.  We had crying young ones.  However, the inflight entertainment allowed me to enjoy music and movies, which removed the distraction.  You can also seat further from the basinets that are located near the front of each coach section.",June 2017,"June 25, 2017",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0

Crying Child All Night Long Gets Old After About 15 minutes,Seoul,Seattle,International,"We've flown on Korean Airlines a couple times in the last couple years, and this particular flight was the worst experience we've had with this particular airline. 

First off, we were not given a boarding pass for our Seoul to Seattle flight back in Hanoi where our journey started. Once we got to Ichneon International we had two hours in the airport. We went to our departure gate to get our boarding passes, but were told we had to go to the Korean Air Service Desk counter in an obscure location on a second floor -- a long walk away. Then, we stood in a line, and there we were given our boarding pass. This whole walking back and forth and standing in line ate at our time to relax, eat, etc. in the airport, and by the time we got back to the departure gate, it was time to board! Korean Airlines should make it easier to get a boarding pass. I can't think of another similar situation that we've encountered. Not customer friendly. 

During the actual flight itself, the airline stewardesses were a bit distant and aloof this time,not particular friendly. The food was fantastic, though, compared with other airlines. In particular, I ate ""Hindu"" meals -- and they were varied and tasty. Behind our seats, a mother, grandmother and child sat. The child whined and yelled and screamed for 95% of the flight, and the two adults could do nothing to quiet the kid for long. On past international flights, the employees have tried different techniques to get the child quiet, but in this case, the women working just avoided this obvious painful situation. We were just left alone to suffer.

lousy customer service,Los Angeles,Taipei,International,"phone customer service rep wouldn't take the 15 seconds it took to just reserve me an aisle seat and instead directed me to the website.  Thankfully i kept her on the line to walk me through this process online and what do you know?  the website seat selection was unavailable.  After that it literally took 15 seconds for her to reserve the aisle seat for me.  Why not just do that the first time?  

Also good luck if you ever try to book a flight or make any changes on behalf of someone else.  Their policy would not allow me to book changes on behalf of my elderly relative and instead insisted to talk to him directly.  Also because of their credit card verification system you can't pay on behalf of someone else without going through the extra trouble of verifying the credit card ahead of time.

Makes a long flight feel like nothing at all,Edmonton,Bangkok,International,"This airline is unmatched for its size. I first saw the two story plane and was just waiting to be forgot in the masses. The flight staff changed my mind very quickly. When you get on the plane is massive but every seat has so much room you don't even notice your sitting three people across(if on the outside) Also at your seat you are greeted with a bottle of water, headphones, slippers, blanket, toothbrush and paste and a beautiful monitor with everything from movies and tv to video games and information. The staff are super helpful in getting your bag to fit and in the right spot and also they are always conscience of themselves when walking through the isles so not to bump into anyone by accident. The in flight food and endless drinks are amazing. You have such variety and so much food you would think you were sitting in a restaurant. The Korean dish is to die for if you get the option. 
All and all this has to be the best airline out there. They are amazing on customer service and are always wanting to make your time on the plane as amazing as possible and will bend over backwards to help you.

Most Pleasent Airline I've Ever Flown,San Francisco,Seoul,International,"This was my first time flying Korean, and I see now why their moto is ""Excellence In Flight"". Korean puts any American based airline to shame. The flight attendants were beautifully dressed in traditional Korean suits and actually treat their customers with respect. They don't steal your allotted carry on. Allow two free check bags. Don't yell at you for using three seats as a bed. Don't tell you to put your backpacks in the overheads threatening to call security if you don't. Because there is enough room under the seats for both your bags and your legs. They don't tell you to close your windows. If you oversleep dinner they'll come back and serve you it when you wake up. Or if you skip it, they'll offer you it at another time. They give you free alcohol, and as many beverages as you want and when you want. They give you free slippers and a tooth brush. There is a lot of leg room. And they treat elderly and children with respect. Flight attendants will rush over to a baby if it's crying, and will give children a crib to sleep in.
American based airlines should be ashamed of themselves for the way they treat passengers. They could learn a few things from Korean.",May 2017,"June 4, 2017",5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

One of the best in-flight experiences,Mumbai,Los Angeles,International,"I have traveled extensively across the globe hopping on various different airlines but Korean Air mesmerized me with its legroom and friendly staff on board. Initially while booking my flight from Mumbai to Los Angeles and San Francisco to Mumbai, I was little skeptical because I am a vegetarian and I don't really have good stories to tell from many previous flights but Korean Air is different. 
One main point for any traveler going long distance is the legroom provided in economy class (as most of us travel economy) and Korean did not let me down. Though because my flight was from Mumbai to Seoul and Seoul to LAX there was a little repetition of food on board which they can definitely improve but whatever they provided was good to my palate. For about a 21 hour flying time Korean air didn't tire me much, thanks to the legroom. 

Maybe online check-in can be little user friendly as I could not web- check in. But yes they did take enough care of my fragile baggage which again made the airline earn a few brownie points. 

On board service is great and the staff would always come with a smile which made the long tiring journey easier. In-flight movie options could have been more as the flying time is longer but nonetheless it an airlines I would recommend all to travel by.",May 2017,"May 22, 2017",5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0
Wow what has happened to korean air?,Bangkok,Honolulu,International,"First off our flight from bkk to icn was on an old a333 configuration with semi flat seats. Semi flat? Ugh. The service checking in was great and the lounge at bkk was amazing. However o just couldn't believe the old configuration they used. 
Service was tacky. The FA's were not that nice. Initially they were but the minute you asked for something it looked like they were pained to fullfill it. 
The food was mediocre in comparison to other top airliners   
But what really got me the most was the service. I could r believe how much they changed   I remember super kind and attentive service. Now it's just a ""don't bother me "" service and I'm business class mind you. 

Returning to Honokulu bia Incheon was only a tad bit better because of the fabulous Apex suites in business class , but the towel like blanket and Tiny pillow coupled with lack luster service , annoyed attitudes , crappy food and a miniscule option for wine and alcohol selection was a huge let down. 
I am really shocked by this as I have always loved and perfered korean airlines above all other in Asia except for Singapore air of course.

Apex suites ! Nice flight except for last leg,Honolulu,Ho Chi Minh City,International,"I was so excited to be flying KAL again as in the past they have always been amazing. 
Our flight KE 054 from hnl to icn was fabulous. Their new 747-8 Apex suites are divine. Although I love the extra side storage you get in prestige class upper deck , I would probably in the future sit below as the ceiling is too low and feels stuffy. 
The seat itself is comfortable however the Tiny pillow and towel like blanket was embarrassing. The AVOD system on a large 18"" screen was good  but temperamental and the selection of movies were A bit of a let down. 
Food : just ok. In the past I used to preorder vegetarian and wish I did.  It just not of a food quality. The worse however is their wine selection.  Omg pathetic and I was shocked. From hnl they do it offer champagne when you first board which was shocking. 
The staff were nice but nothing spectacular like how they used to be. 
Our last leg from icn was to sgn Saigon to which we went from a fabulous plane to an antique 757 with recliner seats for a 5 hour flight. The staff were nicer but I couldn't get passed the ancient plane and configuration.

Better than many but not excellent,Sydney,Seoul,International,"KE-122 SYD-ICN Economy

Travelling to Canada on vacation, Korean Air was significantly cheaper than their competition, The first leg of the flight was Sydney to Incheon. 
From observation, the boarding gate crew seemed to be confused. The passengers were waiting while the boarding time came and went. Still we waited. 28 minutes after schedule the first few passengers began boarding. Delays in the take-off queue meant we got airborne 45 minutes late. The somewhat dated A-330-300 was showing signs of wear and tear.
Immediately noticeable was the generous legroom in economy. I’m 183cm and my knees were about 7cm from the seat in front, even when it was reclined. 
A time eagerly awaited by most passengers is the emergence of the food trolleys from the galley, but the normally appetising aroma wasn’t forthcoming. The two choices offered in economy were not really appealing to a Westerner. My meal was bland, with a soft bread roll an entrée of pasta, pea and ham with no flavour, while the main of beef and vegetables was unattractive in appearance and reminiscent of an army meal. A small 5cm square of cheesecake sufficed for dessert. I was offered a class of red wine which was undrinkable. Later the cabin attendant brought a South Australian Cabernet Merlot which was quite nice. 
The coffee was somewhat bitter but a powder creamer was offered instead of milk or cream That turned the flavour to that of a cheap instant coffee. The second meal before arrival in Incheon was also mixed. I asked for chicken and got beef, while my wife opted for seafood and noodles but found the taste inedible. Crew kindly bought her a cup of instant noodles. 
There are limited choices on the IFE compared to other international carriers, although the movie selection is good. One somewhat puzzling aspect is the standard of English spoken by the cabin crew. On every occasion I had to ask them to repeat, sometimes twice, what they were saying. I say puzzling because Korean Air is a fast-growing airline with a good reputation spreading its services around the globe. PA announcements were also unclear. Perhaps KAL could look at pre-recorded PA announcements by a professional which would make the messages clear for English speakers. Cabin crew need to be clearly understood, especially in an emergency situation where communication can save your life.",May 2017,"May 17, 2017",3.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0

The airline clearly has no policy regarding number or size of pieces. It was so bad that some economy passengers had to have their hand luggage stowed in first class.

Very attentive staff and comfortable flight.,Auckland,London,International,"I recently flew business class ( or prestige class for Korean Airlines) from Auckland to London and return, changing planes at Seoul on both trips. 

From Auckland to Seoul (and reverse) they use a 777 which are quite old and worn, but fine nonetheless for the price paid. Staff very attentive and friendly. Seat was okay, nothing special.

From Seoul to London (and reverse) they use the A380 which I prefer. Seat more comfortable, engines quieter, and overall a newer product with a bar area at the rear of the craft. Traveling from NZ to London requires a 1 night stop over due to no same day connections. However, the hotel  - Grand Hyatt , was very comfortable and meals were quite delicious.  I learnt this trip that a complimentary overnight stay is not guaranteed but subject to availability and that a request has to be made. In reality I have not heard of anyone not being given a complimentary overnight stay, but this is what i was told before i began my journey by Korean Airlines. 

Overall I was happy enough with my trip as I paid a good price compared to the more expensive Singapore Airlines etc. I think I would put Korean Airlines on teh same par as Malaysia Airlines or Thai.",May 2017,"May 9, 2017",4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0

Something Different,Auckland,Seoul,International,"There is only one direct flight to Seoul from New Zealand and Korean Airlines provide the service. Sure you can go via Australia or Japan, HongKong or Singapore but the transfers and changes add hours to a longish journey.
We were late leaving Auckland, paperwork delays on cargo being cited as the reason. 75 minutes after the scheduled time we finally left. The cew had abundant opportunities to make sure that Business Class passengers had refreshments during the delay but for some reason chose to keep busy doing other things. Many other airlines would have distributed the landing paperwork, offered a soft drink or even taken the meal order. Not KAL.
Having an additional 75 minutes in the seat allowed for getting used to the settings, play with the inflight entertainment and generally get comfortable. These are not bad seats, better than some but were showing signs of tiredness as the touch buttons were slow in responding.
Once airborne the crew swung into action, some drinks, not alcohol, and taking food orders. Their English was sufficient, although at times getting your point across required patience. Which was also required in getting drinks - soft or alcohol - for some reason this crew were reluctant to keep offering drinks, on one occassion removing my glass without asking if I wanted a top up - not good in Business Class.
Food was adequate, if you're a big eater be prepared to make do with snacks in between the two meals.
Overall the service was average, seats comfortable and the toilets kept clean and fresh.
Baggage handling, normally the bain of long haul flying, was exceptional. Priority bags did come out first and on the return journey too.
KAL are adequate, would do to look at some of the competition and learn about keeping the customer more than satisified.
Was Business Class worth the extra money? In some ways (seat, entertainment) yes, in others (keeping the customer fed and watered) not so much.
That said the return leg crew were much better and more customer aware so it did make us wonder if the outbound crew were having a bad day....
Would we fly with KAL again? Probably, but not definitely.

As for the flight themselves the onboard staff were totally focussed on us the passengers and you only had to intimate you would like something for a staff member to be at your service.

Best Airline,Sydney,Vienna,International,"This was our fifth flight to Europe with Korean Air and again an excellent airline that never disappoints for long distance air travel due to comfort, leg room, meals, entertainment, air craft, cleanliness and last but not least, the friendly caring staff.  The overnight stays in Seoul / Incheon with dinner, breakfast and transfers are also fantastic to break up the journey in to two equal parts.  On our recent flight to Vienna from Sydney and return the four flights were full but there is still a feeling of roominess eg. 777 planes have 3 - 3 - 3 seating, not 3 – 4 – 3,  as well as fewer seats. Snow delayed our departure from Vienna by 3 hours. Although this wasn’t advised until we had boarded there was complete calmness and patience by all while the flight attendants served refreshments.  Except for this flight, all our trips had been on time, check-ins / passport checks / luggage collection have always been a smooth, quick and efficient process. 
Overall an outstanding, excellent, value for money airline.  It has always amazed me why Korean Air hasn’t ranked higher in airline reviews over the years and I was so pleased when Trip Advisor recently ranked Korean Air, 6th best airline.

Bad bad flight ! Not family friendly airline.,Seoul,Tel Aviv,International,"Bad bad flight ! Not family friendly airline.

We are family of 5. Parents and 3 children. We booked our flight 10 months ago, chose the seats to be next to each other (and windows for the little children).
We made our web check in a day before the flight (with the same seats).
But when we arrived to the gate - our 3 children got a different seats. That was without telling us (just gave a different ticket to the child).
The new seats were in a different area of the airplane!!!

When we noticed that and try to fix the problem. They continue the check in. All the airplane was full, and we needed to ask favors to seat near our children.

At the end- we got bad seats and the 13 hours of flight was horrible.

This was our first experience of Korean Air. When we next travel out East, they'll head the list of Airlines we'd choose. There was so much that was good:
* Service from Crew was impeccable, the only suggestion was that maybe they could be a bit more proactive. Once you'd asked for something, there was no problem.
* Food was different and better than expected. My Korean style spicy Octopus was one of the best meals I've had in about 40 years of travel by air.
* Cleanliness - both planes (777 on London legs and 747 to NZ) were scrupulously clean. It seemed that toilets were cleaned after every use. We preferred top deck on the older 747 as it was lighter and quieter.
* Seat space and functions - a good, flat bed with plenty of space.
* Connections - we had time for a shower on the outward leg, very refreshing. On the return leg, an overnight stop, with meals, at the Airport Hyatt was a real treat.

"Incredible Staff, Great Service - Little to no leg room, ended up separated",Seattle,Seoul,International,"Traveled August 2016.
Hubby and I had an opportunity to travel to South Korea for the ""first"" time, both of our ""first"" international trips. We attended the International Korean Adoptee Association annual conference. (I was born in Korea, but adopted to a US family as a baby, grew up in Seattle. So... *technically* my second international flight.) We worked through the conference's travel agent, so did not handle the reservation. Price was extremely high, but August is a high-traveling month for Korea. If you have the option to choose a different time, I highly suggest Spring or Fall. Summers and Winters are *harsh* if you're not used to the extreme weather.

Flight Seattle > Korea
Staff was friendly, seats were comfortable, leg room was standard = poor. Their in-flight meals were delicious and well heated/chilled as appropriate. Don't bother getting the American food, try something different! Get the Bibimbap! (Hubby *did* get American food on the flight home, and said it was good. Some kind of beef and rice dish.) I got Bibimbap both directions. The chili paste comes in its own tube, so your food doesn't have to be spicy if you don't want it to be. I asked for extra chili paste because I LOVE it. Being from Seattle, we get really good Korean food at home, so I wouldn't say the food was amazing, but it was above average! For others flying from places where Korean food isn't readily available, you'll *LOVE* it! Their in-flight staff was gracious, accommodating, easy to understand if English wasn't their first language, and efficient. In-flight entertainment was TOP NOTCH. There are plenty of media to choose from. Movies, TV shows, music only, documentaries, etc. They have an option to learn Korean phrases as well. The temperature was HOT. I know flights like to adjust the temperature to where you'll be, so it *did* help prepare us, a little. Living in Seattle, we weren't used to the heat and humidity that August in Korea would provide, so I'm glad the airline tried to help us adjust as needed. We both are able to sleep on flights, so we got a little sleep in.

2 weeks later, Korea > Seattle
This is where stars get knocked off. Unbeknownst to hubby and I, we had been separated on the flight. Hubby and I don't have children and it was our first big international trip together. He had never been on an international trip before. We both would've preferred to stay together. We asked and pleaded for the check in gate to find us two seats together. Staff was nice, but said there was nothing they could do. I ended up in the 2nd to last row in the back, and Hubby was 20 rows ahead of me, so we weren't even close to each other. Had to get up to talk with each other, and then couldn't talk long since we didn't want to bother other passengers. Not the airline's fault, but I ended up on the aisle sharing a seat with a woman and her 12 year old. Had the child laying *sideways* on the seats, so kid's feet were on me the entire 12 hour flight. Nothing the airline could do, but didn't ease my frustration. Flight back, my screen didn't work properly at first, had to have the screen reset. Once it was reset, it worked fine. Since we were heading back to Seattle, plane was cooler, which was much more comfortable to sleep in. In-flight service was still amazing as the first flight, so in-flight staff get a thumbs up!

PROS: Planes were clean, new, even somewhat refreshing to travel in, except for legroom which is standard for economy flights. Food was amazing. Hubby and I were quite impressed! In-flight staff was the kindest staff I've come across in years.

CONS: Leg room, hubby and I not sitting together, screen issues on second flight. If hubby and I had a bigger budget, we would've sprung for premium economy for more leg room. (Hubby is tall and always needs an aisle or lots of leg room), and then we might have possibly been seated next to each other both ways.",August 2016,"April 19, 2017",4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,5.0

Great trip besides the baby crying most and the elderly seated at emergency exit seats.,Brisbane,Toronto,International,"I've travelled with Korean air a number of time but this last time was horrible! Was seated near 4 children in which one did not stop crying and I do mean did not stop crying for like the entire trip. Although the hostess' did try their absolute best to calm the baby!  Maybe if they placed children flying in a area more suited it wouldn't be such an issue but to have paid over $3000aud for the 2 of us to travel to have a baby no older then 1 to ruin the entire 10 hour flight!
I've flown with other airlines that have areas set aside for children towards the back of the plane like virgin airlines in  Europe not the middle of the plane in the middle rows like Korean air. 
Not entirely Korean airs fault. 
Also heaven forbid if we had to use the emergency exit we would have been in a bit of a situation as the passengers that were seated at the emergency seating area looked well over 70 years and of age both sides of the plane maybe Younger stronger passengers of Korean speaking back ground would be more suitable to emergency exit row on that flight!

The drink menu offered on the selection was awesome, but was never offered. Had to ask for wine, never got refilled and such a SMALL glass. Food was okay, and presentation was good at best.

2009 I flew to Heathrow Airport via Seoul with Korean Air with a stop over in Seoul,Brisbane,London,International,"2009 I flew to Heathrow Airport via Seoul with Korean Air with a stop over in Seoul and had lovely friendly staff and a great flight.. The overnight stop over was paid for by Korean Air and was a very comfortable night in a hotel close to the airport with vouchers for dinner and breakfast and then a lunch at the airport the following day before flying out to the UK.. The whole experience was easy and friendly and the food was great for the vouchers.. Loved it.. Was a fast trip coming back with a 4 hour stop over in Seoul but seemed to be easier coming home to handle such a long haul than going.. On the whole it was a good clean easy trip to the other side of the world.. I have had worse trips just flying interstate LOL..

"A Mixed Review ""The Good, The Bad, Not Ugly""",Honolulu,Bangkok,International,"First off the flight from Honolulu to Inchon was 2 hours late leaving, Upon arrival the stewardess came to me and informed me that we were over 2 1/2 hours late and I must hurry from gate #117 to gate #7 at Inchon and to contact the ground crew for assistance to expedite my connection. I disembarked and saw four ladies in KE uniforms when I asked for help two of them abruptly turned away the other 2 just returned blank stares at me. I knew then I was on my own. I made it to the airport train shuttle to departures and the lines were 5 deep, I finally got on the third round. I made it to gate 7 and there was no one but the attendants. I handed them my boarding pass and they let me on. The A380-800,KE653 was hot upon boarding and felt like it was on a fast turnaround and not much time to clean. I refused the meal and the stewardess gave me a funny look. Later I went to use the restroom and was stopped by the stewardess telling me it was dirty, ""All 4 of them ?"" I replied and got no answer.I turned to return to my seat and there was a guy sleeping on the floor in the small hallway connecting the two isle next to the toilets, ""Unbelievable"". I was over 3 hours late and missed my hotel taxi to Pattaya 120 KM away from Bangkok.
 Return flight March 14, BKK to Inchon. ""What a pleasant surprise"" the A330-300 was clean and cool and they even had bottle water on the seat, flight to Inchon was on time and service was great.

Skip this airline and go EVA instead,Chicago,Ho Chi Minh City,International,"I had expected so much more. We took Korean air from Chicago to Saigon and from Hanoi to Chicago in March. The seats very uncomfortable. I had paid close attention to make sure it was the same air craft as the EVA plane we took last April. The planes are listed as the same but, are very different. Korean Air seats are traditional with the recline being only the back. EVA seats glide forward with the seat and back moving making a reclining seat. I had the middle seat last year on EVA and was very comfortable both ways. I had the aisle on Korean both ways and it was the longest flight I can remember.
The food on Korean was terrible. I had special ordered vegetarian my sister took regular meal. Neither of us eat the food. EVA the food was great. Because I'm vegetarian I again ordered that with my son regular meal.

Clean comfortable and impersonal,Los Angeles,Chitose,International,"Booked biz class lax to Sapporo using miles.

Check in was efficient but impersonal.  Luckily they did not charge me the extra I had anticipated for a large snowboard bag. No instructions on how to get to the gates. 

The lax KA business class lounge was a joke. Peanuts in pouches, ramen in plastic cups, a few bottles of booze and hundreds of people.  No thanks. 

Boarding was efficient. Ah, the plane. The A380 was amazing. Huge, spacious and beautiful.  My seat upstairs was very comfortable and everything worked perfectly. Luckily no one next to me so I really felt spoiled. IFE was fair, food was passable. The bustling flight attendants were very nice but not overtly friendly. Anything you wanted they brought quickly, but you always had to ask. Massive bathroom.  Loved the two lounges.  Flying on the KA 380 was a lovely experience. 

Seoul Biz class lounge was a disappointment. The only good thing I can say is, nice clean showers.

Domestic only,Seoul,Jeju,Domestic,"Me and my partner traveled on KE on their domestic route from GMP to CJU, which has a flight time of approximately 50 mins from take over to landing. So the flight is very short but they used a 747 on this route.
I checked in online and selected 2 seats behind the wing as I prefer to be able to see the views, however upon check in the agent that processed us must have moved us without letting us know. which irked me because she gave us seats further up but over wing. I specifically didn't select over the wing seats for that reason.
But anyway, I didn't make a fuss as it was a domestic flight and less than an hour.
Boarding was quick and eventually was seated. No inflight entertainment on our flight which was disappointing as I would have liked to see what was offered by KE compared to other airlines and only a drinks service was given; again understandable since flight is less than an hour. However, even a cold snack option would have been nice since when I traveled on TG between BKK and HKT, we were given a snack box with sandwiches in on the domestic route.

Price for the domestic flights were very reasonable at approximately £37 per person oneway GMPCJU. Wouldn't mind trying them on a medium/long haul journey to see how they're really like.

Korean Air - Modest Comfort For A Long Haul,New York City,Ho Chi Minh City,International,"My wife and I recently returned from a trip to Vietnam.  We flew Korean Air from JFK to Inchon, Inchon to Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi to Inchon and Inchon to JFK.  We flew economy class the entire trip.

The boarding process for Korean was very orderly.  The board by special needs and class first.  For economy class, they board by section for the larger aircraft.  We were in the first group of economy class to board.  Although boarding order was not much of an issue.  The large aircraft had plenty of overhead storage, so there wasn't much of an issue on that front.  

I took advantage of my early booking, using seatguru to find the best seat in economy class.  I had a seat (I believe 47D) that did not have a seat in front of it.  That gave me extra leg room on the two flights in and out of JFK.  These were the longest flights, at close to fifteen hours each direction.  

The plane was modern and comfortable.  The seats did not feel too restricted and the leg space was decent even on the flights where I did not have the extra legroom.  Each seat has power outlets as well as a personal entertainment system.  Because I did not have a seat in front of me, mine was stowed in the armrest.  They offered a wide selection of international and blockbuster films.  There are also games and music options in the entertainment menu.

The food was good and we were served often.  The young flight attendants were very attentive and eager to assist travelers.  On a long, weary flight, having pleasant flight attendants makes a difference.  We have had international flights that were not so cheerful (El Al).  

Because we booked through a tour agency, our flights were super cheap.  Even with the steep discounts, they offered mile rewards to Korean Air rewards members as well as 70 percent to partner airlines like Delta.  

Overall, I enjoyed Korean Air.  The food was good, the service was impeccable, the seats were comfortable enough for such a long flight, the price was affordable and the overall experience was positive.  If given the opportunity, I will choose Korean Air again.",March 2017,"April 2, 2017",5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Amazing how many languages the staff knew! English and korean was expected,  but once I heard spanish, tagolog, russian and japanese from several of the staff, I was definitely impressed. I hold appearance a priority. The vessel cleanliness is outstanding.

I had travelled from Shanghai (PVG) to Seoul (ICN) and was en route to Yangon (RGN). On the previous flight I had a delicious spicy chicken dish and on the second flight I tried the bibingka. It was delicious and was served semi-prepared. You add rice, chilli sauce and mix yourself. This came with delicious miso soup on the side and I find that the best drink to accompany the Korean meal is Korean green, or gingseng, tea.

The seat was very comfortable and there was an excellent choice of in-flight entertainment.",March 2017,"March 20, 2017",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Best. Airline. Ever. (So far),Seoul,Manila,Southeast Asia,"This is probably the best airline I've flown on, despite the relatively short duration of the trip. The flight was a bit delayed in leaving due to the heavy traffic at Incheon International airport, but it arrived on time at NAIA terminal one despite the heavy turbulence at certain points along the route.

High points: 

1. In flight meals - The food was excellent! The hot rice was a great touch. Ordered bibimbap and it was great. The veggies were crunchy and fresh, though the gochujang wasn't as spicy as I expected it to be. They are also probably the only airline to serve soup (in this case seaweed soup) as an appetizer, and it was very good as well. And the dessert of ice cream was an excellent conclusion to the best in flight meal I've had.
2. Toilets - Cleanest airplane toilets I've seen so far. Unlike other airlines, this one has complimentary toothbrushes in the lavatories, perfect if you want to brush after your meal. 
3. In flight entertainment - I understand that due to the short distance, the choices for inflight movies, tv etc. are limited. Nonetheless, their movie selection was up to date, and I especially like their choice of documentaries.

Low points:
1. In flight entertainment - I would have expected their in flight tv programs to include the latest episodes of popular Korean dramas and variety shows. Sadly (at least for a Korean drama fan like me), that was not the case. It would be nice if they included more Korean dramas in their in flight entertainment, especially considering their growing popularity worldwide.
2. In flight cuisine - even for short flights, it would be nice if, aside from the one in flight meal, we also get even just one snack to keep us full.

Other than that, overall, I give the flight five stars.",March 2017,"March 14, 2017",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

Very pleasant surprise,London,Auckland,International,"We have used Korean Air for six flights during the last six weeks, 4 Business Class for journeys between U.K. Seoul and Auckland, and two Economy fights between Seoul and Tokyo.

We received a high quality and consistency of service on all flights. The food in Business Class was exceptional. I am quite an adventurous eater and tried a range of Korean meals as well as ""safe"" European meals. The KE staff provided good explanations of what was included in the dishes. The accompanying wines were all of good quality but if I had one tiny request it is that the KE staff are a little more proactive in offering refills. This is probably a cultural issue as the vast majority of passengers are Korean and they do not appear to have our European desire for alcohol on flights.
The provision of overnight accommodation at the Grand Hyatt, Incheon on the return from Auckland was very welcome and the arrangements were efficiently organised, although it would have been beneficial to have more details included when the booking was confirmed.

One of the best airlines I ever flew with,Berlin,Auckland,International,"We chose Korean Air for our holiday to New Zealand. We had little difficulties during Check-In in Berlin because our first flight was operated by Air France and the Self-Check-In Counters we had to use did not accept our Korean Air Tickets (Online Check-In has not worked either).
However this was just a little drawback on our whole flight. The airline provides a lot of legroom in their Economy and you can choose between several different meal options. Contrary to experiences with other airlines they managed it very well to remember the correct meals. The crew was always very polite and helpful. The meals were of good quality and the on-board entertainment provided a lot of good options to choose from.
Taken everything together the flight experience was great and worth 5 points. However the check-in procedures can be improved greatly.

Good value for money compared with other national carriers flying to NZ. Excellent service and food on board from the ultra polite Korean aircrew. This route uses the Boeing 777-300 for the London leg and a 747 for the Auckland leg. The business class seat configuration is 2/3/2 on the 777 and 2/2/2 on the 747 upper deck with staggered seating. This gives each passenger access without having to step over the person sitting or sleeping next to you. Hope KA introduce the A380 which will be an improvement to both legs. The other issue to be aware of is online check-in. The system permits passenger to select their seats 48 hours before departure except travellers from the UK, USA & Canada who get 24 hours. This effectively means you'll not get a choice when it's busy. The return leg from Auckland to Incheon included an overnight stay in the Grand Hyatt with evening meal and breakfast.

Fee for second checked bag is $ 150,Seoul,Bangkok,Southeast Asia,"Outbound from BKK to ICN I was allowed to check two bags with no charge, but on the return a fee of US$ 150 was imposed for checking second bag. 

Travelers arriving in Korea should note that it can take a long time to clear immigration and customs in Seoul. For me it was 107 minutes of walking, standing, taking train, more walking and waiting. By comparison I cleared passport control and customs in Bangkok in 27 minutes. When departing from Seoul, passengers should note that it can take as much as an hour and a half to clear security. ICN is a decent airport for transit, but for arrival and departure not so much.

Passengers considering booking this BKK – ICN ticket on Korean Air should note that the services are not much better than you could get on a budget airline. In particular, you should fill your own water bottle after clearing security, because you will not get much water once you are airborne. The cabin crew on my flight was, with one exception, young and inexperienced. They played food cart bumper cars in the aisles and at one point had a five cart traffic jam in the aisle next to my seat. Also, avoid the exit row seats as there is no under-seat storage for personal items. Considering the difference in price, and the lack of much in the way of 'full service' services, you are better off flying one of the budget airlines such as Air Asia X, which flies basically the same route (direct flights that depart from Don Muang, DMK, instead of Suvarnabhumi, BKK) for less than half the price of Korean Air.",February 2017,"February 21, 2017",2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0
First Class with Chase Miles,Singapore,Los Angeles,International,"For those of you like me who like to redeem you hard earned miles/credit card miles; First Class on Korean Air is well worth it. I had the pleasure of flying with them less than two weeks ago and can tell you with great confidence that they are one of the best airlines that I have flown in my life. I was a heavy Star Alliance flier and then UA went downhill with their program (and so did UA as an airline), so I went rouge and steered away from loyalty. With that being said, I used to fly Asiana every chance I could to Korea and beyond. Now my mind has been made up after flying both A380s and intra-asia premium cabins. Korean air took the lead. Great inflight teams that were so attentive and graceful. For 80,0000 miles one way from SE Asia to N. America, I would say that this was an exceptional value. Lounges in Inchoeon do need a bit better services provided to their First Class passengers, however, the onboard product made up for it. Having flown Emirates, Etihad, Singapore Air, and Emirates in First Class I can safely say that the onboard product on Korean Air hold its own when stacked up to these 5 Star and 4 Star airlines.",February 2017,"February 20, 2017",5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
Cheap and cheerful but lacks luggage,Sydney,Frankfurt,International,"Brought a return flight with Korean air and the service was comparable though didn't think it was exceptional.  Depending on your layover time it is possible to get a free hotel overnight but you must request directly either with reservations or your travel agents.

The website for information needs an overhaul but you can ring their customer service who speak excellent English.

Don't be surprised to find you will pay for an extra bag when checking in they only allow one piece up to the 23kg limit then you are paying for an extra piece.  I found this very unreasonable cost $170 AUD (even though the total of both bags weight was within the limit)  While I did try to contact services before flying out I do recommend you check first or have your agents clearly state the luggage allowance.  

In total this could add up to $320 extra cost to your return flight which doesn't make it any better value than say an Emirates flight same route which has better luggage allowance.  Would not recommend to anyone going forward.",February 2017,"February 20, 2017",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,,,

Business  (Prestige) Class - LHR to SYD,London,Sydney,International,"My first time with Korean Air. Flew Business (they call it Prestige) from LHR to  SYD via Incheon (Seoul). I didn't want to travel in economy.  Too bloody far for a man of my maturity to be wedged cheek by jowl with the great unwashed. Ha ha! Went to Adelaide 2 years ago on business with Emirates and knew I couldn't do it in economy after that. I also knew I probably couldn't afford Emirates at around £4000 GBP. So after shopping around in April 2016 through Flight Centre, they price matched Skyscanner at £2353 return. This included a 24 hour layover on the return leg at the Grand Hyatt Incheon including dinner and breakfast. Jet lag, what jet lag? Transfers in both directions were smooth and uncomplicated.  Lie flat beds on the 777 from LHR and on the 380 from Seoul to Sydney. So let's be clear, it probably isn't to the same standard as Emirates but then neither is the price. The service is excellent and although not as alcohol driven as Emirates you can pretty much have what you want. I've seen a few negative reviews on Korean but for the money this is a pretty tough service to beat for less than £2500.",February 2017,"February 20, 2017",5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,
My favorite way from Asia to USA - but one BIG problem persists....,Bangkok,New York City,International,"I have flown between Asia and the United States on Korean Air many, MANY times.  It's my preferred carrier.  I also ensure my colleagues and others traveling between Asia and the United States choose KE.  Everyone takes such pride in their work and makes sure that every passenger is happy and looked after.  From the lounges to all in-flight amenities, Korean Air has invested so much into becoming a true premier carrier.  There is one very BIG problem that Korean Air and one slightly less of a problem that Korean has and I hope that they soon address and fix both of these issues.  First, the BIG problem.  In Prestige Class meals are served according the meal time in Korea.  This is absolutely the most annoying process.  Long haul flights should serve a full meal after takeoff and again before landing and keep the cabin quiet and dark in between.  But on Korean, halfway through the flight, when you should be sleeping, the lights come on, the carts roll out and a full meal is served. It is horrible and cruel treatment to do that to the customers!  I fly constantly and Korean Air is the only airline that times its meal service to such a crazy schedule. I beg Korean Air to do what all other airlines do on long haul flights and allow the customer to sleep!  The second problem is that it is usually almost always 2-3 degrees too hot on Korean Air.  The cabin temperature on KE flights is absolutely the hottest of any carrier that I know of.  I would be very interested to know the industry standard for in-flight temperature and I would love to know if Korean Air follows this standard.  I can promise that they don't!   Despite these two problems I still remain loyal to Korean Air and am hoping that these issues will be soon resolved.",January 2017,"February 20, 2017",5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Fond memories of KAL dashed.,New York City,Manila,International,"Delta booked me on a KAL flight from JFK to MNL, going through Inchon (ICN).  I was mildly excited because of an excellent KAL experience about 8 years ago.  

I flew Business Class, which takes up the entire second deck of an Airbus A-380.  All the ""stews"" are attractive 20ish/30ish women, and they do try to serve.  Most have limited English skills, but two were very fluent.  

Check-in was a PITA.  I landed at Terminal 1, KAL is in Terminal 4.  That means you have to leave the secure area and re-enter. Really dumb. You can check-in on line, but can't print a boarding pass.  They also do not participate in TSA PreCheck, though they say they're working on it.  Finally, when the Delta agent booked me, I asked and was told that as a Sky Team partner, I would earn MQM points, but did not; I had to fight for them (I won).  That's a Delta issue, not a KAL one, but be aware.

Seats are the old-fashioned side by side style, but they lay flat. Storage is plentiful.  Limited entertainment. One neat feature was a martini bar in the back, I think sponsored by Grey Goose.  But, if you want something else, you might wait a bit, as it's in the front of the plane!  Still, the martini bar is a way go get up and move around, enjoy a drink at a table or on a sofa, with a light snack to boot.  

KAL lounge in ICN is OK, nothing to write home about, but it does have a nice shower set up.  Snacks are limited.  Good WiFi.

Would fly with them again,Sydney,Qingdao,International,"Would fly with again

I'd never flown with Korean. Overall it was a good experience, we were in economy and travelling with 2 young children. The planes seemed really clean. The Korean meal they served ie some cold meats and pickles with rice and a soup was actually one of the best airline foods I'd experienced. The entertainment was ok, it was a bit limited and not many titles but it was adequate to watch a recent movie. The television programs were really average and limited. The service was efficient and friendly enough. I think air travel is so serious these days they can't be anything but efficient and distant, so they did a good job with what they have. They made travelling with a baby quite pleasant allowed some priority access and made the trip that little bit easier.

I would rate Korean air alongside Cathay and Etihad as my choice of airlines and Korean had some features which made it pleasant. I'd certainly travel with them again and travelling via Seoul is well worth it for a couple of days stop over. 
Seoul airport is really good, same but different. The airport had some really good features for economy travellers like free showers, rest areas, food was great and there were a couple of childrens plat areas. All good",January 2017,"February 8, 2017",4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0

-the bread was served well after the main course

Great airline!,Singapore,Washington DC,International,"One of the best we have flown in.

Note: due to weather conditions, our flight was delayed and connecting flight may be missed. They made an effort to shift us to the front before disembarking so we can get off faster. GREAT!!

Best of all, the legroom for an economy seat was the most generous of all airlines we have flown in! The seats were also wide enough for you to 'move'about.

Good service but bad veg food!,Kathmandu,Honolulu,International,"Generally no complaints with the exception of the vegetarian meals.  I ordered these for my daughter, who does not eat meat, and what she received looked like baby food. It was literally just pureed vegetables and nothing else; no protein. For her - a 12 year old (not an infant) - this was inedible, so she had to survive on bread.  In this day and age, when vegetarian food is well-known in most places, there's no excuse for such meals. At least there should be some beans or lentils to provide a balance of protein, and there's no need for the food to be pureed!  It was yucky.  On a positive note, we were pleased with how organised our overnight layover was.

My only complaint is that it seems that no matter where I am flying I always have a tight connection in Incheon.  It would be great if they adjusted their schedules to give you more time or had a better on time record.  To their credit when I have had close connections there has always been someone waiting for me at the gate to help speed me through transfers so that I still made my connection, it's just unnecessary stress.

On other KE flights in the past, trying to check in 20 hours before departure, it insists it is >40hrs before departure so you can't check in, or it refuses your confirmation code.

Comfortable Economy Seats For Long Flights,Chicago,Seoul,International,"I have flown to Asia many times, but this was the first time I have flown on Korean Air and it is the first time I had comfortable flights.  On most airlines I try to get exit row seats, expecting it will be more comfortable.  On Korean Air, the regular economy seats are more comfortable than an exit row seat.  I was surprised as I am 6'2"" and 285 lbs, Until now, I have never been comfortable flying on any airline for these long flights.  I was even very comfortable in a middle seat!  Have you ever heard someone say that?

I don't know much about Korean food, most of it was good and they gave me much more than I could eat.  Some of it was very good.  The one thing I missed was that they did not serve an omelet, usually one of the best foods on USA airlines flying those long trips.  For many meals they offered 3 choices, not just the 2 choices for most airlines.  I was never hungry or thirsty, and I turned down many offers for beverages.  On most other airlines I feel the need to take everything they offer because I never know when I will have another chance to eat or drink.  On most other airlines I also have a large water bottle to stay hydrated.  On one Korean Air flight, the flight attendant was encouraging passengers to take 3 or 4 bags of peanuts (yes! they still have peanuts).  Peanuts are nutritious and encourage you to drink more fluids which is good because you lose a lot of body fluid in the dry airplane atmosphere.  On my 4 long flights, I was never hungry or thirsty and I turned down much of the food and drinks.

There was no Wi-Fi on my Korean Air flights, that is inexcusable.  I need Wi-Fi to communicate with others and entertain myself.  Airlines could save a lot of money by getting rid of their dated entertainment systems and providing free Wi-Fi.  However, the comfort of the seats made the flight seem much more acceptable, and I never felt the need for Wi-Fi.  For future reference, get rid of the expensive personal entertainment systems, we know how to entertain ourselves.

It's no longer the class E-but-cheap airline it was but they serve so many locations and are much comfortable & reasonable than some of their Asia-based competition.

GOOD FOR THE MONEY,London,Sydney,International,"We have just returned from a christmas trip from Sydney having got business class tickets for £2450. I think for this money one needs to limit their expectations. It's a flat bed to the other side of the world. Premium carriers were well over £3000. Check in was quick and smooth, The lounges were fine, not top class but for the money more than adequate. Food offering at Seoul was average at best, Sydney breakfast was the best of all. On board everyone was extremely courteous and professional. English was widely spoken. The food offering was pretty good on most sectors even asking how one wanted their steak cooked and then delivering on that offer, the korean dishes were good especially their signature Bibimbap. I had one dish (cold noodle salad) that wasn't for me, without hesitation after seeing i had not touched it the Flight attendant offered me any other choice I wanted. Korean seems to put less emphasis on drinks than European airlines. Not a bad thing, just different. However once you realise that they only pour about a third of a glass at a time or won't be quick in offering drinks after take off you only had to ask and a drink appeared immediately and with a smile. The wine from LHR was mainly French and pretty average. From ICN-SYD was Californian or Australian and better.

There are some new films but the on board entertainment is average. With iPads loaded with films and magazine sthis becomes less important these days.

The business bed (the older type on 777's out of Heathrow and the 380 to SYD) were spacious although not the most comfortable for some one 6'3'. They say they are 180 degree flat beds but they aren't completely flat. There was an annoying plastic foot rest that meant you couldn't stretch out enough and the head rest wouldn't push up far enough to not hit your shoulders, along with the pillows being about A4 size. I see that from April Korean are rostering a 747-8 on the LHR-INC route that will have the new prestige sleeper suite. Although also prices are rising to £2550-£2850. I think once you start pushing towards £3k better airlines start to look good value.

Due to the near 20 hour gap between flights Korean put you up at The Grand Hyatt hotel at the airport which was fantastic. We had dinner and breakfast included and the food on offer was spectacular.

If time is no major concern the ability to break the journey (especially at an airlines expense) have a great nights sleep and then carry on the next day is ideal. I don't think I have ever felt this good after 24 hours of arriving back from Australia.",December 2016,"January 13, 2017",4.0,,,,,,,,

After to numerous attempts to select seats in advance we finally gave up as the Korean Air website kept crashing and would not allow us to check in in advance meaning we would have to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived in Seoul from another city in Russia and needed to transfer. For our flight to Sydney. This however made check in near impossible as we did not have access to the check in desks which were in another terminal. The information desk told us we needed to check in at the gate. Again this was not possible as security would not allow us access to the game gate area without boarding passes, something we obviously did not have leaving us stuck in no-mans land. Eventually we managed to convince security to let us through so we could go to the gate. There was still no way to check in and the  The Korean Air staff staff did not arrive until 40 mins prior to takeoff leaving us waiting for nearly 3 hrs with no-one able to help us. We were not the only people in this situation, there were at least 13 others in the same situation. This late check in was very stressful and did not allow us a selection of seats or even to allow us to sit together as the plane was full. We told them it was unacceptable for our 11yo old son to sit on his own and wanted at least 2 seats together. The gate staff staff worked quite hard and managed to find 2 seats together making us the last passengers to board. Luckily for us the on board staff spoke with one of the other passengers and arranged a seat swap allowing the 3 of us to sit together. Now to the actual flight, seating quite good for legroom, the meals were average but acceptable ( a little small), the entertainment system was good but a little lacking in content but OK, the cabin staff were great, very attaentive and efficient.

"It was a night flight, so the staff slept and gave NO SERVICE at all",Kuala Lumpur,Seoul,North Asia,"No wonder Korean Air gets people so upset

I paid for a business class ticket Kuala Lumpur Seoul and back, just for one night, the flight left around 12 midnight

when I got on board, no drink (alcohol) before take off, ok maybe Malaysian rule, but then why can't they take your order for a drink BEFORE taking off like SQ do and give it to you as soon as the seat belt sign comes off - NOPE, useless.  On boarding they said 'we are serving BREAKFAST, it was 12 midnight, I asked what else, they said nothing, but you can have instant noodles and there is a small snack on a stick, dreadful

after take off and 30 minutes after I had to ask for a drink, I then had to wait until my 'INSTANT' noodles were ready

I got my noodles and a TINY glass of Champagne

then NOTHING, I think they all went to sleep, so I called for another glass and it took ages for them to come, then NOTHING they never came again and my empty glass stayed next to me all night

The stick snack was disgusting, the breakfast not much better

the next day I came back, the lounge food is even worse, pumpkin soup - that tasted sweet and a dusty floured egg an prawn sandwich - no choice, too bad if you don't weat prawns

obviously NO Care, though, planning or anything goes into the food and beverage of this airline.  Asiana Airlines is 100% better in every way

On the return flight the food wasn't better, and the service almost as bad (though they were awake) the flight attendant forgot to offer me everything, the towles, the menu, a drink, atop up even though she served the lady next to me

it was just amazingly bad

and as for the food - well they seriously need to look at what they do and how they do it

and they use these old trolleys with food on them down the aisle, can't the crew carry plates - the service is from the last century

no reason for an airline to be this bad - try Singapore Airlines, Cathay, Asiana, JAL etc they ALL are far superior

Wake up Korean Air, your press is already bad enough, don't do things to make it even worse, try some customer focus and service training and get some good food",December 2016,"January 4, 2017",1.0,3.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0
Impressed,Phnom Penh,San Francisco,International,"I was a little reserved about flying with Korean but they were recommended by a friend and I'm glad I tried them.
The flight options were perfect for my requirement and the price was excellent, particularly for around Xmas time.
Planes were new and spacious enough. In flight entertainment is as good as I've had. The crew were all very friendly and helpful. Not sure what more you'd need, from my experience they compare very favourable with economy seats on other good quality carriers.

B747-8i,Hong Kong,Seoul,North Asia,"I'm not loyal to one particular airline nor partner, when it comes to choosing which airline I will fly with I always go with the aircraft configuration, and Korean air offers b747-8i on their midnight flight, offering you absolutely privacy and superb storage space, therefore go with Korean air and you won't regret it! 
Flight from HKG to ICN on KE607 departed on time, same for the return leg KE608. 
It is a double decker flight and some business class seats are on upper deck. Boarding is a little confusing as they board both F,J, FF and Y classes almost the same time with Y, and it's a bit chaotic scrambling your way into the hallway, once you go up to the second deck it would be peace. 
Meal on board is customized to your taste. I don't eat anything spicy so they've offered a non-spicy bibimbap, which is amazing.
Air stewardess are friendly and they will make sure everything is up to your satisfaction.

Good Airline But Long Layover Issues,Bangkok,San Francisco,International,I have a soft spot for Korean Air and I have always enjoyed visiting South Korea.  Seoul (Incheon) is a good airport and is pretty easy to get around.  Every time I fly this route there is always a long (12-15 hours) layover in Seoul on the way back.  Going over is quick and easy but returning and just sitting for over half a day or night is not great.  China Southern and some of the other airlines give you a hotel room for layovers over 10 hours or more but not here at least not for me and this is my 3rd trip with them.  The crews on the flights were great and the cabin was as fresh when we landed as when we took off I do not know how they do it.  I also had great experiences with the ground crews and booking and checking in.  Good airline and I will fly again.,June 2016,"December 25, 2016",4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0

Perfect travel,Chicago,Ho Chi Minh City,International,"I fly business class internationally a lot. This carriers scores high in all areas and on a par with Cathay. 

Boarding was timely and prompt both at ord and incheon. You are met with smiling nicely dressed and friendly aircrew. What a change from the day to day ugly US fare.  

The flight was quiet and with little turbulence. You're  not warned about a thousand things you absolutely cannot do in flight and everyone is efficient and friendly. 

I was amazed by the food quality. Like I said I do this a lot and this experience was just not what I was expecting. It was more like a decent restaurant - the steak being cooked perfectly medium-rare. Beverage and wine selection was superb.

First Time not flying on SIA and fly by night,Singapore,Seoul,North Asia,"Our trip to Seoul is planned for a 3 night 4 day, I had planned to travel by night (early morning 1:30am ) sleep during flight and we can start our day in Seoul, and
we can fully use the 4day.  That kinda of wishful thinking/planning.

It was our 1st night flight.
The flight take off late due to the earlier flight land late.

It was pack, almost all the seat are taken.  And mostly Korean.  

We would not tiled our seat back as the back seat Korean passenger didnt like it.
So all 3 of us got to sleep in original position, as the leg room is longer than our previous experience we can cat sleep now and then.  However the volume of snore in the whole flight is quite an experience.  In the morning, my wife whisper to me, ""I thought you snore loud, its whisper compare to them"".

That lead to all of us lost the Tue in Korea, lucky the hotel is really very nice to have
us check in early, 11am instead of 3pm (check out Hotel ShinShin) as the room is ready.

We heard the Korea flight at time it served beef in their meal, so we mentioned it during booking, its a wrong way to do it, pick something else instead of mention no beef.  We were served India vege meal, the prata is not like prata at all.  Lucky thing there is a spare Western egg set which we later requested for our girl.

The video and game are not our liking, but the audio are quite good, but not much of choice and each are rather short.  The onflight terminal is more like a Android tablet which the audio player feature is at bear min.

Best airline yet!,Brisbane,London,International,"Ive chosen this airline a number of times now and they never disappoint! In fact, my last trip was even better!

I normally fly Singapore or Emirates, but the last few times I chose Korean Air! I joked around the first time, saying I was booking my ""chicken flights"" as there is always a chicken in a Korean movie and they where actually the cheapest at the time, so I did not expect much...but... THEY ARE BRILLIANT!

One of my flights had a over night stop in South Korea from Australia to England. They put me up in the nicest of hotels (The Grand Hyatt Incheon) and provide dinner and breakfast. It was also great because I had a lovely shower and refresh before my next flight. This has happened twice now and I love it, it helps break the flight up if your not into long distance travel or unwell (like my dad when has flown with them). Or if your like me, into exploring, you can get a full night tour of Seoul City as a added bonus rather than sleeping in the comfy bed! The hotel and meals are all included in the cost of the flights as well as the shuttle service to and from the hotel. The tour was extra, but the hotel staff help with this. You have the option to take luggage or just handled to the hotel. I recommend just handheld for your overnight stop. You get shower stuff at the hotel, so you only really need a spare pair of undies and maybe your own toothbrush.

The flight itself was very nice. The crew where very helpful and accomodating. Their two main languages are English and Korean, but sometimes Chinese. Their English is really good and everything is easy to understand. The food was great too! Western and Korean options are available. The snacks are anything from noodles to a slice of pizza and you can grab a drink of coke, tea, guava or something else at any time during the flight. The toilets are kept clean at all times. I chose economy, but the leg room was still decent, comfy enough chairs and decent entertainment on board. Plus they have universal plug sockets for charging your phone, laptop, iPad etc.

Unfortunately, Korean Air took it upon themselves to move up the 2nd flight by 5 minutes (months after ticket was purchased and competing tickets were higher priced), leaving the layover too short to qualify for the minimum layover time. As such, ended up with a 11 hour layover instead of the original planned 45 minute layover.

The seats on the plane in the upper deck are very comfortable, lay flat and were wide enough to sleep very well for over 6 hours of the flight.  It helped to have been fed so much food that I passed out from it.  Wow...so much food.  So much to drink.  There was a lunch and dinner service and of course you're able to order cookies and ramen during the flight anytime.  I also visited the front and back bars on the plane where I was able to get a nice Absolut Vodka based cocktail.  The in-flight entertainment choices were so-so...not that many things to see, but was entertaining enough.

I know it doesn't mean they will be able to do it for everybody all the time, but the same itinerary a day later was not full planes so the KAL agent I phoned booked us on the same flights a day later and there was absolutely no extra charge.

Eva Air > Korean Air,Seattle,Da Nang,International,"This was my first time flying with Korean Air and my experience was OKAY, at best. Not great, but not terrible. I visit Vietnam about twice a year and have always flown Eva. The only reason I chose Korean Airlines this time was because I wanted to go directly to Da Nang instead of SGN and Eva doesn't have that option. 

Upon checking in at the SEA airport, the CSR wasn't too friendly. I asked if there were any upgrades available and she shook her head, saying that I should've booked first class from the start. Not even giving me the option to pay if I wanted an upgrade. So, I was under the impression that it was a full flight and proceeded with the check-in process. I asked the CSR to put a fragile sticker on my suitcase, bc I had makeup and a few other things in there that I didn't want getting tossed around. Instead of happily doing what I asked, she questioned what I had in there that was fragile and when I told her, she asked me WHY I didn't pack it securely.... As if it was such a crime to be extra cautious.

Boarding wasn't too bad, nothing out of the ordinary. Surprising enough, the flight was not full at allllll, so I didn't understand why I couldn't get an upgrade. Everyone in Economy basically had an entire row of seats to themselves. We departed on time and arrived in ICN for a 55 min layover.

My flight from ICN to DAD was slightly delayed because they had to ""wait for a few passengers to board."" I fell asleep shortly after take off, so it wasn't a huge problem.

Overall,
PROS: Above average legroom and less crowded flights
CONS: Bad food and sub-par customer service.

I highly recommend sticking with Eva Air if you have the option.",November 2016,"November 1, 2016",3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,,,

Great airline.......but....,Seoul,Beijing,North Asia,"This is an airline that does most everything right. 

The positives: Leaves promptly per schedule. 
Baggage handled flawlessly. 
Flight attendants are spotlessly groomed, uniforms pressed, and the whole staff could have been cloned. 
Airplanes are new, and squeaky clean inside and out. 
IFE works quite well with many choices in many languages.
Desk and online agents are well trained, helpful, and fluent in many languages.

Now for the negatives:

Inflight food is on the horrid level. Not spoiled. Not stale. Not of an entity that was completely unidentifiable, but a tasteless TV style dinner that was so bland, it would be hard to define what it was if you weren't staring at it. From Incheon to Beijing, then from Shanghai back to Incheon isn't very far. Granted. But the food was almost identical, and of the same level of desirability. Long haul trips may be entirely different, but for a couple of two hour plus inter Asia flights, it was kinda marginal. Economy level food, yes I know, but nonetheless. 

Seats pitch: I'm not sure what it was, but for me it was tight. I'm 6'2"" and usually fly coach without too much discomfort, but I was very grateful no one was sitting directly in front of me and decided to recline their seat. With similar conditions on a long flight, that would have been the flying equivalent to waterboarding.

Flights going both directions were Boeing 777-300's and were smooth as glass, and in both cases we left as scheduled, and arrived early. With regards to the noted negitives, it's still a good option for transportation.",November 2015,"October 24, 2016",4.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0

Instead, some nuts were served on board, but it wasn't really good quality and the taste of it was not so good either.

Seating is standard for economy and service extremely courteous, but I'm not a great fan of the inflight meals. There is a choice between Korean and Western but the latter are consistently quite poor. Inflight entertainment is also relatively limited. Their were only around eight latest releases on this trip which is below par when you have a 22 hour return journey. My main reason for travelling with Korean Air is the convenience of the flight timing from Heathrow which leaves early evening and arrives in the afternoon of the following day, but other than this I would prefer BA.",October 2016,"October 16, 2016",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,,
Acceptable,Honolulu,Bangkok,International,"The attendants were attentive and did offer enough water  the food we bring on board which is better..
Enough leg room without annoying boxes under the seats. It is a long way and directions not clear to cross the airport to the next  connecting flight. we were dissapointed with the new Incheon Airport although it has the usual designer stores it is badly designed and worst of all you have to queue at one payment counter for all of the cafes on the food hall meaning you have choose from menus there or walk around them all to see what you would like then go back pay and get a ticket -all too much trouble. The oxtail soup we chose was tasteless boiling white miso with what appeared to be 5 lumps of inedible meat and cost $34!

Cheaper but first-class airline,Auckland,Amsterdam,International,"Considerably cheaper than other options available at time of booking. Had to stay one night in Seoul, but this was fully paid for by the airline and was actually a bonus in our opinion. Only niggle was that whether or not the compulsory overnight stop would be free was not confirmed until after making the booking. Online booking very easy, but after choosing the option to hold the booking for 24 hours, they would initially not honour the quoted price when I decided to confirm it.

The Television Adds are NOT Wrong,Atlanta,Hong Kong,International,"When Korean Air's adds say that their priority is service, they are telling the truth.  Our original flight to Seoul was changed to Korean Air when the Delta reservation system crashed, and its sad but I was very happy for the change.  I've reviewed Delta, and they are good.  KAL is MUCH better.  Delicious food, VERY service oriented staff, extremely comfortable seats and my wife and I loved the forward looking cameras in the nose and tail of both planes we flew on.  One of the best parts of the flight from Atlanta to Seoul was the bar at the back of the upper deck.  Great place to wander too and just relax (as if the rest of the aircraft wasn't relaxing enough!).  Simply put, if I need to go to Asia again, I'll go via Korean Air.

First experience and surprisingly satisfying!,Montreal,Siem Reap,International,"We were traveling from Montreal to Siem Reap with two stops (Toronto and Seoul) on our way for a trip in Cambodia and Vietnam.  We were supposed to take an other company, but ended with Korean Air and I have to say it was great from beginning to end!  The plane was big enough, giving us plenty of space to be confortable. The service was A1 with good meals and way enough drinks!

Great flight with good food/entertainment but ONE big draw back,Seoul,New York City,International,"The food is tasty in my opinion and they feed you about 3 times during the long direct flight. The crew was very professional and helpful. The movies, tv shows, games, music available for free was great. Some recent stuff too and enough of it to keep you occupied for hours (much needed on a 13-14hr flight). 
The seats only recline so much which was so helpful when the old lady in front of me tried to basically lay down (she would have been fine being in my lap as hard as she was trying to make the seat go back even further!) 
BUT the one big drawback that annoyed the hell outta me on my flight was that a woman behind me was playing a touch screen game quite vigorously, her touch screen is the back of MY headrest so needless to say...I felt every button tap as she excitedly played her game. I only slept when she took a break from playing. It was annoying but I'd fly with Korean Air again if I needed a direct flight.",August 2016,"October 2, 2016",4.0,3.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0

The only question is "" why can't you have a stop over on the way back?"" Two fights back to back is hard going at my age. The stand out for me is the leg Room on these planes. You can stretch out.

Flown w/ them 5 times; always happy,San Francisco,Seoul,International,Korean Air seems to have more seat/leg space than most other airlines (in economy).  Flight attendants are consistently helpful and considerate.  Aircraft/seat area is clean.  Bathrooms are tended to by flight attendants routinely.  My experience with their being on time for take offs and arrival is satisfactory (not great// not poor).  Summary:  Korean Air's training program for their customer contact personnel and priority placed on cleanliness is well above average and value for dollar deals can be found with a little effort.

But the gem offer is a free stopover in Seoul (only on the outward bound trip). A bus transfer to a 4-5 star hotel with dinner and breakfast vouchers and return transfer to the airport the next morning is the highlight of the trip.

The meals are well prepared, variety of selections compared to other airlines, also yummy snacks during a long flight. Though I have to say that they usually run out of some meals when the foodcart goes towards the back of the plane so they have no option but to take the ones left. They also have tons of movies, TV shows, music and games in their in-flight entertainment so you won't get bored.

They were still flat bed and the service was still first class but it would be nice if Korean Air made sure that on all long haul flights their Business and First Class seats were pods as this makes the journey just that little bit more enjoyable.,August 2016,"September 27, 2016",4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

Pleasant Flight ~,Seoul,Madrid,International,"It was awesome flight ~~ I had a family trip to Madrid, Spain and took Korean Air.

One Drink Flight,Brisbane,San Francisco,International,"We went on a flight to San Fran and found Korean Airline pleasant but missing a few things like several alcoholic drinks. 
The Tip Is:
When the FA only gives you one drink with your meal simply ask for another. They always say yes to the second and third drink as they want to keep customers happy. 
The leg room was ample, entertainment system was good with large screens but the food was average with no fresh milk to go with my coffee. 
Best thing I did was buying my Bose Headset. With them on I found I could sleep on the plane.",September 2016,"September 27, 2016",4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,
Over Asian Snacks,Brisbane,Milan,International,"My travel agent recommended this Airline because my husband has a back injury and she thought if the trip was split up it wouldn't be so hard on him.
The flight we had left at 8.30 am and arrived at Inchon airport at 5.30 pm.
We had a stop over at Seoul, accommodation and meals provided by the airline.
Our flight the next morning left at 9.30 am and we arrived in Milan at 8.30 pm.
It did make the long trip more bearable.My only complaint is all the meals are Asian,no English option.In between meals they came around with snacks,theses were also only Asian.They were also a bit mean with their wine service,only one glass with lunch on the Seoul leg of the trip.",August 2016,"September 27, 2016",3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0
Stopover is valuable,Brisbane,London,International,"You know that an airline is good when, two weeks before departure your Travel agent rings to say that the flight has been cancelled BUT if you choose to fly a day earlier the company will offer you two free nights accommodation in one of the airport hotels. That was our introduction to Korean Air and it got better after that. The food was bland - welcome to any Cattle Class - the service attentive, the aircraft extremely well-maintained and the in-flight entertainment as varied as it was bland. 
Each leg of our journey departed on time and landed on time. We had the usual Economy class leg-room, so that the person in front has their head in your groin ten minutes into an eleven hour flight and there were no extras other than the scheduled meals.

Korean Air is #1 with me!,Osaka,Los Angeles,International,"I've been flying back and forth between Japan and the US for 20years, and I ALWAYS fly Korean Air.  Of all the airlines I've flown they are hands down the best.  From the time I walk up to the check-in desk at Kansai International Airport in Osaka to the time I walk off the plane in Los Angeles I enjoy exceptional service every step of the way.

"""Excellence in Flight""? ... Yes!!",Sydney,Seoul,International,"The motto for Korean Air is ""Excellence in Flight"". In the past few years I've flown more than 300,000 miles on KE including this flight, a return leg, and I would wholeheartedly endorse that motto. The cabin crew members are always kind and extremely helpful, irrespective of one's nationality or language. Their level of service is consistently high, and this even makes being crammed in cattle class a more pleasurable experience. It does help that the Airbus series flown by KE on long-haul flights has a slightly better design with more legroom (and more bum-room) than most of the other airlines. 
As for the audio-visual component, the personal video screen is surprisingly large, and there is always an excellent selection of up-to-date movies to choose from. I might suggest that the ""classics"" section could include a few more of the old favourites than it does at present: the storage space required will not add many Gb to the existing storage. The audio selection is likewise comprehensive, and the sound quality is excellent. Airline food usually gets bad press, but KE long haul menus are almost always quite edible, especially since the Korean national dish of bibimbap is usually available, a mixture of rice with minced beef, bean sprouts, other greens and mushrooms, which is very tasty when mixed together with the sesame oil and hot sauce provided.
I have problems with my legs, so I require a wheelchair service to get to and from the aircraft door. Once I'm at the door, the cabin crew couldn't be more kind. However, the preboarding service really needs to be looked at more carefully. Other carriers will offer a true pre-board, so I find myself in my seat and settled down well before the first set of passengers arrives. Korean Air seem to want to get everyone on board as quickly as possible, understandably, but I would suggest that preboarding simply starts a little earlier. As it is, I am scarcely at my seat before the first passengers are pushing their way past me, so please, if anyone at KE reads this, preboard us wheel-chair or other preboard passengers a little earlier to give us time to reach ouir seats and get settled in, out of the way. 
In conclusion, I believe that Korean Air really does offer excellence in flight, but as a passenger requiring special assistance, I would like to see that same excellence extended to the ground part of the trip as well.",September 2016,"September 27, 2016",5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0

Think about it,Brisbane,Vancouver,International,"We flew with Korean air via Seoul to Vancouver last year. We do so like to avoid LAX at all costs. The only glitch was an impossibly short plane swap in Seoul. Due to taxiing issues, we had less than thirty minutes to swap planes and we had to pass through security again. We ran, they were paging us for the next flight and we had to oush past lines to plead our case. They managed to have us bypass security on the way back so they learned something.

Under rated excellent airline,Seoul,New York City,International,"Korean Air is an under rated excellent airline for both business class and economy.  I have flown JAL, ANA, Asiana, AMERICAN, UNITED, DELTA, emirates, qatar, qnatas, cathay pacific, air china, EVA, singapore, finair, BA, lufthansa, china eastern etc., long haul and Korean Air is a top product service

Towering strength service : korean air is in a very short list with extremely well trained p class flight attendants offering pampering service.  Only asiana, jal, ana, singapore airlines offer similar levels of service
Hardware: full flat bed seats, including staggered 2-2-2 for business with their very private window side seats in their newest planes and the older 2-2-2 is still very spacious.
Incheon airport hub: regular global top 3 airport efficient with great shopping.  Efficient transfer 

For full transparency things KE could be doing better:
Business and First class lounge are not as nice as Cathay Pacific in Hong Kong or Singapore Airlines in Changi

Needs Improvement,Las Vegas,Seoul,International,"This is a red eye flight on a 773ER and the only direct flight to Asia from Las Vegas.  Check-in was very easy, and we whisked by security rather quickly.  The premium lounge used in Las Vegas was sub-par with a couple choices of sandwiches and drinks. The Kosmo first class Suite was very comfortable, but I was very disappointed in the food, it was quite bland; even when adding the Korean Condiments.  The inflight entertainment needed more programing on my opinion (there wasn't enough on this 13 hour flight and no wifi), and the service lacked refinement; compared with other first class products like Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific.",June 2016,"September 25, 2016",3.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0

For a leading airline, I am surprised they don't have wifi on-board, and the choices for entertainment was very very limited.  Less than halfway through the flight I watched all I was interested in the inflight entertainment.

Hot muggy economy cabin,New York City,Seoul,International,This was my first trans-pac flight so I have nothing to compare it to. Our A-380 had no air vent at each seat. The cabin temperature was miserably warm and stuffy. On the plus side the food was quite good and both the food and beverage service were pleasingly frequent on the 13+ hour flight. They seemed to require everyone to pull down their window shades which I did not like. The flight attendants were efficient bordering on robotic.

The entertainment was quite good and since it was a long flight I watched a bunch of series episodes and movies. 
At the airport in Incheon I bought a tourist temporary visa and went on a free town tour on some buses provided-luck had it that it was a public holiday there and there were some market festivities. Loved the cultural tours and the museum. Back at the airport waiting to board there were stations where you could make your own art and people who showed you what to draw and all-very interesting.

They lost points due to stews attitude toward free in flight beverages and their food service did not know we had special meals ordered (allergies) .

A  Great Airline No One Uses,Seattle,Cebu Island,International,"Every interaction with the folks at Korean Air was a true 'Excellence in Flight' experience. They make you feel really special and they do it in a professional, friendly manner. Check-in, no matter what the airport, is flawless. It is like they are trying to make the experience better than the last time you flew with them. And they succeed! Obviously things like clean airplanes, attentive staff, great food, and comfortable seats are a minimum norm. I have only two areas that I would suggest need corporate attention, and they are really executed by third parties. Their Korean Air credit card administration is not on par with the rest of the things Korean Air. On more than one occasion I have had trouble using the card on large purchases, even after giving them date and location ahead of time. This is NOT a security issue, rather incompetence by the card issuer (US Bank). The second area I believe could be improved is their Frequent Flyer program. There are sometimes five different prices for the same seat on a flight and unless you buy the more expensive ticket, you can use you frequent flyer miles to upgrade. (The price difference in the cost of these tickets for the same seat is in the thousands of dollars so this is not a small matter.) With that said, I will go out of my way to fly Korean Air if at all possible because Excellence in Flight is not just a company motto, but  a part of their total airline DNA.",August 2016,"September 8, 2016",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Fantastic Service as always,Brisbane,Seoul,International,"I wish I had of started reviewing airlines last year, as I have only flown KAL once this year. I will say however, that whenever I have flown with KAL, the service has been outstanding. The business product is good, with everything you need. Lay flat beds, good amount of room, and mist importantly, fantastic service.
One thing I have noticed on Korean Air flights, is that at the slightest sign of turbulence, the pilots switch on the fasten seat belt signs - the accompanying announcement with each activation becomes somewhat annoying when trying to sleep. I'm not sure why they do this, as it is not something I have struck with other airlines, except for Air China.
The lounge is Brisbane was the Air New Zealand lounge. Like most lounges in Brisbane, its pretty average, but serviceable. I believe this may have been updated since I last flew with KAL.
The western food and beverage options are always good on KAL flights also.
One thing I will note, and its a bit weird, is that the bathrooms on these planes are maintained wonderfully well. Anytime you go into them, it seems as though you are the first to do so.

Another good flight,Seoul,Brisbane,International,We checked in in the city and it was extremely efficient. When we arrived at the airport we just had to go through security as we had cleared immigration. We headed to the Prestige lounge which was below standard in fact a little better than the public area downstairs. Kids were running around in an unruly manner. It was crowded and noisy. Not what you normally expect from a lounge. The flight was slightly delayed. I had the same seat returning and it was comfortable. Food and wine were good.

Great flight,Brisbane,Seoul,International,Everything went well from the check-in to the onboard service. Normally Korean Air uses the Qantas lounge but it was closed for renovation so I was directed to the Plaza Premium Lounge which was new and extremely pleasant. The flight attendants were friendly and unobtrusive. While the seat was not as wide as Singapore airlines it was comfortable and my seating area extended the length of three Windows.  The seats are in a staggered conformation with addition of a privacy screen that could be raised. The movie selection was surprisingly good. The food was plentiful and tasty.

Good & Bad,Las Vegas,Bangkok,International,"I booked Korean Air because its was the least expensive option from Las Vegas to Thailand.  Most of the staff was great although the gentleman that checked me in at McCarran airport was a little smug when he told me that I would have to check my carry on bag because the COMBINED weights of my two pieces was over 12 kg. I have flown plenty and I've never been through this; usually it is the weight of one bag that will cause them to check the bag.  Nonetheless, I ended up leaving the bag behind (NOT!) so I wouldn't have to deal with the baggage claim in Bangkok.  Please be advised, if you try this trick they will solicit you for your bag at the gate if they see you with it so keep away from the gate until your flight is lined up and laving.  Stupid rule.

The flight was pretty good.  The leg space in coach is more than any American airline, which is typical.  The food was better than average for airlines, and the flight attendants really do care about your experience.  They are probably one of the best group of flight attendants (coach) in the world.  The biggest complaint (other than the carry on rules) is that the inflight movie options are terrible.  Make sure that you download two seasons of whatever you want to binge watch to the hard drive on your laptop.  They have power outlets under the seat so you will have enough power.  However, if you plan to stay entertained for 12 hours with their selection then you will be very disappointed.  

Lastly, I had a 4 hour layover in Incheon going and a 15 hour layover coming back.  Please note, there is a transfer lounge in ICN that is awesome.  It is very clean and there are daybeds and showers for you to use.  Take advantage of these if you have a big layover.",August 2016,"August 26, 2016",3.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,4.0

I was surprise when we were originally in the mid section of the plane seat and suddenly we were moved to the tail end of the plane.

Was truly dissappointed when I realized the crew of the KE flight favored mostly Korean passenger to be seated at the front row to the mid section of the plane seats.
 
I complained about it and they insisted there was no seat available for me and my daughter in the mid section as where we were originally supposed to be seated. The crew said only they were sorry because the changed to a smaller plane.

They only changed plane. I don't understand why we needed to be moved at the tail end when all Koreans who boarded on the plane was in the front row to the mid section.

Fantastic Airline Service! Made our longs flights pass quickly,Frankfurt,Hagatna,International,"Wow, Korean Air is fantastic! We took this flight to move from Germany to Guam and luckily got upgraded to Business Class for the 10 hour flight, that was nothing short of AMAZING! 

We were also moving our dog with us and he flew cargo with them. They were great from the Customer Service via the phone to the staff at the airport to help us get him checked in, it really made the whole process less stressful! At Incheon they even called from the gate to check on him and make sure that he was OK and would be on the flight with us. 

Our first flight was 10 hours and luckily in the Business Class section with the sleeper pods, it was so comfortable! We loved all the extra space, the super friendly flight attendants, and the food. Our teens were thrilled with the experience and I love that the flight attendants checked on them to make sure they were doing well and had every thing they needed during the flight. 

Our second flight was 4 hours and we were in Economy class, even this was much better than we are used to. There was great leg room, blankets & pillows, and the TV sets with remotes in each headrest. The food here was less fancy than what we had in Business class but it was still good.

1.  You can use the airport lounge, but only certain credit cards are accepted (check which ones before you go).  The lounge has a mouth watering buffet of food.  Alcohol and soft drink included.  Comfortable seating.  There is usually a promotion, I've always paid around 26 dollars and worth every cent.
2.  Free shower for all those in transit
3.  Free tour of famous sights of Korea if you have more than 2 hours in transit.  You need to go to the information desk once you arrive to book your tour.

Top of the Economy Heap,Washington DC,Seoul,International,"With few exceptions, we have traveled economy class for more than 40 years.  It has gotten worse and worse over the decades, but Korean Air is the top of the economy heap.  Not as roomy as United's Economy Plus, but decent enough at the price.  (I am 5'8"", my wife is 5'5"".)  Service was first class, and the planes were well-maintained.  Food is nothing to rave about (what airline food is?), but some Korean dishes are offered, which makes for a pleasant change.  We have recommended Korean Air to friends flying to SE Asia.

Very good experience,Atlanta,Davao City,International,"My trip was actually in January 2015, the dates wouldn't let me go back that far. The plane we were on was the Jumbo Jet and I say it was HUGE as I watch it taxi to the loading dock-not sure if that's what you call it lol! The trip was booked at capacity so it was packed. They fed us good food and very frequently. You would not go hungry or thirsty at all. I did accidentally ordered a Korean food from the choices the steward gave me and I didn't like it, but that was my fault. Maybe it was actually good, I just did not know how to eat it. It was called something that sounds like bibimpap? Lol! They flight stewards were very friendly and they were gorgeous! The entertainment TV in front of the seat was plenty big and you have movies to watch that just came out on theaters. The only thing though, it was HOT! I was sweating. Used to, there were directional little air vent you can control for yourself, I don't think we had any but a tiny light. It was winter when we traveled to Asia so maybe the heater in the cabin was running. Or maybe everyone's body heat was just warming up the whole plane, who knows. They do give you blankets and shoes so you can take off your shoes and relax. Over all, I would definitely fly back with Korean Air. Loved it! Plus, our connecting flight to Davao, since booked with Korean Air, we were First Class with the other airline. So, we were in VIP lounge and and were treated pretty special. Lol! I do want to mention that the Seoul Incheon airport was first class and ginormous! Sparkly clean and can't see one but of trash anywhere! Can't wait for our trip again in 2018.

"Accomodating to infants, great service & food",Bangkok,Vancouver,International,"Travelling on your own with a 7 month you look for hassle free. First impression lasted, no extra charge for choosing the front rows with bassinets. Plenty of bassinet seats as well. Adding to that a generous luggage allowance even in economy.

Checking in at Suvarnabhumi (Bangkok) was smooth as we were given priority. We didn't have to check in the stroller as odd size either but I could take it all the way to the gate! It was then delivered at the gate upon arrival, and had I wanted I could have got it at the stop-over as well.

Priority boarding for kids and very helpful staff on board is an extra plus. They also are very engaged and give you instructions of what you can and should do as a parent to show courtesy to co-passaengers. I don't mind this at all, it rather shows they try to make it good for everyone. And they have some good tips for first-time travelling parents. 

Walking up and down the aisle rocking my baby a flight attendant offered help so I could use the toilet!

Adding to this I think they have some of the best vegetarian/vegan inflight meals! Good portions including nicely cooked vegetables, lentils, beans, tofu, rice. No doubt about it being completely animal product free either.

We left Sydney early in the morning, arrived in Seoul late afternoon time (there's only one hour time difference), were bussed to the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in, and we were also given a fabulous buffet dinner and breakfast. It was great to break the journey to Europe with a good sleep in as the flight to Rome didn't leave til about 2 pm the next day. On our return from Milan we only stopped in Seoul for two hours so we didn't get that option that time but that was OK. 

The food was actually really quite nice (I chose vege options) on all four flights that we took. The crew were genuinely friendly and they just had a great customer service focus that didn't seem forced like it can sometimes seem on other airlines. The cabin was clean.

There was a reasonable selection of films to watch, not that many, but enough for me.

On our arrival back into Sydney, the weather was atrocious (one of the worst storms in Sydney for a long time) and it was an unpleasant experience having to circle Sydney time and again in very bad conditions due to congestion at the airport and the stupid curfew. We have flown a lot and really couldn't imagine how the pilot could land the plane, but he did and it was pretty heroic if you ask me! We later heard some other flights trying to land just after us were diverted to Melbourne and Canberra. I felt very grateful that we had been able to land because I just wanted to get home. Thanks Korean Air pilots! I'd fly with them again.",June 2016,"August 5, 2016",5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
Excellent Service in the Trans-pacific Route,Nadi,Mumbai,International,"We flew in Korean Air for all our trips to India, when i was working in Fiji. 
First of all it is a very safe airline, don't be biased by all the reviews in wikipedia & airsafety etc. Flying in Business Class obviously has it's own perks, but believe me, the Business exp in Korean Air was far better than the Business class in Singapore airlines, that too on their flagship Airbus 380 flying between Singapore & Sydney.
In Korean Air, even the economy class service is far better than the business class service in some other airlines. 
I also had the opportunity to use their Business Lounge at Seoul. It is excellent.
All in all this is really a very wonderful flying service and puts forth a wonderful experience. Once you fly Korean Air, for that particular route i am sure you would not like to look for any other options.",September 2015,"August 5, 2016",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Being my 1st time to take Korean Air, I am impressed by service and aesthetics of this airline service. Not getting the desired seat, we sat at the emergency exit area which was good for me...all that leg space took claustrophobia  out of my mind. The team/crew all looked very neat, were very polite and discreet. I hardly heard their voices while they did run around serving the passengers. They love their job! We had a little problem with the aircon which was not as cold as we expected but the steward cared to ask if my husband eventually felt comfortable. Then he explained how the aircon also warms up etc..etc.. The food is good...looked clean and was presented very neatly. I chose a Korean dish and was asked if I knew how to eat it!

Delay reason not mentioned and some crew seemed not happy to be on the flight,Seoul,Kuala Lumpur,Southeast Asia,"There were 2 delays from ICN to KUL and there were NO announcement why, asking the staff gets u NOwhere.
The airport is very large and luckily Korean Air flights are parked nearby.
We were traveling on standby tickets, and we were anxious as the ETD was approaching and there were no update on the boarding passes. 
We noticed we were not given much assistance compared to other Korean passengers.
Perhaps it's a language barrier, however the staff seem to speak good English.

Inflight as we were allocated middle seats, we are served by both sides of the flight attendants, on one aisle the crew is noticeably newer than the other.
The newer crew is more attentive and smiles more.
It makes me feel more compelled to give KE the high scores because of her.
On the other aisle the more experienced crew is going through her motion and has a ""u 'd better know what u want and don't waste her time "" kind of body language.
Any extra questions is returned with a stern reply.

Perhaps this is not a golden flight for them, I however noticed the passengers are very well behaved compared to other flights on other airlines.

Food wise, the quality is better than Cathay Pacific and they offer Korean chilli sauce in economy.

The best thing I had on board, though, was the pizza! I don't know what it is made of, but it was the best I've ever had.

They ran out of food and unfortunately we were near the back of the plane.  They gave us this inedible mush they called porridge, but it was worse than grits for breakfast.  There was very little on the tray that would appeal to a westerner.  All of the Asians in seating in front of us ate the western breakfast, so there was nothing left for those at the back.  The attendants were not too impressed when we handed them back trays that we had not touched except to try it.

"Surprised by seat pitch, seat-back monitors, food",Seoul,San Francisco,International,"Given Korean Air's safety issues over the last couple of years, this was not my first choice, but it turned out to be a good one.  While we were forced to sit in the middle of the middle section of a 747, it was a fairly new plane, and the seat pitch was about 33 inches (2 inches better than 'normal' these days), and the seat-back monitors not only had movies on demand (not much better than usual here), but also had something unique: over 1000 classical music selections!  This was major, for me.  
And, the food was better than expected - eons better than United (ie, it was actually edible).  The bimbambom was outstanding.

There was ample legroom (I'm 5'10""), very clean, with fluffy, larger pillows and blankets. The entertainment left nothing to be desired. It was,almost as if I had spent an 8 hour break in my living room before getting off the plane for my short layover/tour in Seoul.

Needs improvement in meal options,Hong Kong,Seoul,North Asia,"Flying with Korean Air was ok. The aircraft is ok. On-demand entertainment is available on board and the service was ok. Flight attendances were generally nice to passengers and keep on smiling and try to accommodate passenger's request. On my way to Seoul, they only offered Korean pot rice and stir fried beef with rice. Both are with beef and I do not eat beef. I finally chose Korean pot rice and took out all the beef. But I was surprised to see that they put really a lot of beef in there as it's not common to see so many beef in the Korean pot rice even in a decent restaurant in Korea. On my way back to Hong Kong, they had Korean pot rice and chicken noodles but when it came to my turn, only Korean pot rice was available and I had to choose it again. It will be good if they have more varieties of meal options as it seemed that many people could not take beef on the flight as well.",May 2016,"August 3, 2016",3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,3.0,3.0
Always very pleasant experience,Sydney,Prague,International,Firstly I always fly with them. Excellent flight from Sydney to Incheon and Incheon to Prague. The experience is very always pleasant and all crew is excellent and helpful. The in-flight food and drinks were surprisingly good. The price was fair for the time of year and despite being in economy I felt that I had adequate space. If you have an overnight flight they always provide complimentary accommodation in 4-5* hotels in Incheon.

The return flight was from Paris with a short wait for a connecting flight to Sydney.
Service was competent. The food was poor. Inflight entertainment in English was fairly limited.

Much better customer service than other airlines,Atlanta,Bangkok,International,"I have taken Korean Air before and I have to say the trip into Korea and out of Korea to Bangkok aboard Korean airlines is a step above US airlines and other airlines.  The airline uses Boeing 777-300s which have extra leg room.  Many TV programs and games (chess, all sorts of games) to choose from and movies which haven't appeared on DVD yet (My kid saw Zootopia which wasn't released yet).  They have a long list  of programs including different movie genre, documentary, kid programing and other programs including all types of music. You can also follow the plane as you go and get exact details on speed, location, elapsed distance and distance and time to destination.  Best equipment I've seen on any airlines.  You can also view forward and downward cameras on the plane which is really neat when you land.  The crew are all beautiful women and I think many of them smile and greet you warmly as you board.  The girls move faster and can get you anything you need.  For each flight we had a blanket, pillow, earphone which is normal but they also gave us toothpaste, toothbrush and slippers so you can take your shoes off. They are generous when it comes to the food as well.  Kids get their own meals.

Top notch service on a long flight,Chicago,Bangkok,International,"We have flown Korean Air more than once on the route from Chicago to Bangkok. Our experience has been first rate each time. The flight attendants are gracious, helpful, attentive and patient. On such a long flight, they serve several meals, beverages and snacks. Every request from a passenger is dealt with quickly and professionally. 

The planes are newer model Boeing 777 dream-liners from Chicago to Seoul. They offer a bit more leg room and seat space than the 747 which is usually the plane for the Inchon-Bangkok portion of the trip. The seats are acceptably comfortable, though finding an empty seat next to you is cause for minor celebration. In-seat entertainment with current movies and tv programs, as well as lots of games, help the time pass. We really appreciate the feature that allows you to follow your journey on the screen, too. Headphones, real blankets and a pillow are all provided with no charge. Overhead storage is spacious, and we have not had any trouble finding room for our carry-ons.

While few airlines have wonderful food, Korean Air is notable for decent meals served efficiently and with appropriate frequency for a 14 hour flight. Beverages and snacks are always provided on request between scheduled service. 

The layover in Seoul is only 45 minutes on the flight we usually take. The first time we went on this trip, we were concerned about the short connection time, which included security, immigration and customs. We were shocked when a Korean Air employee met us at the gate with a sign showing our connecting flight. She gathered all of us who needed to make the connection and hurried us through the airport and the necessary checkpoints. We were thrilled to be in our seats a few minutes before the door closed to whisk us on to Bangkok. This, for us, demonstrated Korean Air's real commitment to customer service, and ensured our loyalty to them in return.

Will Not Travel Korean Air Again,Washington DC,Seoul,International,"In April 2016, I was flying from Dulles Airport, Washington DC to Seoul/Incheon South Korea with connecting flight to Manila on Korean Air.  I will not fly Korean Air again.  I had a briefcase with my laptop inside for under the seat and a carry-on for the overhead.  I also had 2 checked bags.  They took my 2 checked bags first, and then said I can only have 1 carry-on.  I said I do, laptop case does not count.  Then they said my carry-on is overweight. Then I said I will transfer weight to my check-in bags, but then they loaded them and they are gone.  Then they took my carry-on bag and gave my my tickets and told me to go to the gate -- so I guess they checked it in for free.  It took me over an hour to get to the gate through security, etc.  After sitting there for 30 minutes, about 30 minutes before the plane leaves, they call me up and tell me my carry-on is at check-in.  I said I did not forget it -- you took it.  Now they said it is there and I have to go back to get it.  I said ""the plane will leave before I get back, so I can't get it.""  ""Oh -- too bad.  Then we will have to check it in, and it will cost you over $100"".  "" For my carry-on?""  Then why did you take it and tell me to go to the gate?""  No answer.  What a scam.

So I decided to try Korean Air again last year on my flights to Los Angeles, with my return from New York. I was not disappointed, their in-flight service was top notch. Even though the flights were longer than direct from Australia, returning from New York meant I did not have a domestic US sector with the time consuming necessity of changing terminals, extra security checks etc., nor the added sector fare.

Korean Air is My Favorite Airline to Vietnam and Singapore for Past Five Years,Buffalo,Ho Chi Minh City,International,"The trip from the East Coast of the USA to Southeast Asia is long and tedious. Total travel time, with layovers, can reach 35 hours. The comfort of the planes, and the care of the staff on the flights, are critical, especially when flying in coach. Korean Air has been my airline of choice for the past five years as I have flown to Vietnam and Singapore to teach college business courses for American colleges.

The Korean Air staff are experts at caring for their passengers, whether on the ground or in the air. Twice, Delta Airlines (my connecting airline to the Korean overseas flights in the past) mis-tagged my baggage to Vietnam (sending it only as far as Korea). Twice, Delta Airlines refused to fix the problem. Twice, Korean Airlines staff fixed the issue (at the Atlanta layover) without question or fuss. I now fly from Buffalo, NY, through JFK, so JetBlue is my first flight, and JetBlue takes care of correctly tagging my luggage all the way to either Hanoi or Saigon. If you have the choice of connecting airlines, pick JetBlue.

The food on the Korean Airlines flights from JFK to Seoul, Korea, and from Seoul to either Hanoi or Saigon is excellent. Passengers are offered a variety of drinks, including unlimited wine at no charge. The seats are comfortable, with plenty of leg room. The Seoul terminal is stellar ... clean, modern, with plenty of shopping. 

If you have a long layover in Seoul as you transfer, there is a passenger lounge with unlimited food and drink, and WiFi, for only $21.00 USD. There also are free showers.

The inflight entertainment system is superb, with more movies than you could watch, even on a 13-hour flight.

I've flown Singapore Air once, and it was good, but for me, it was no better than Korean Air. I flew United Air to China once during the same time, and will not fly United again. There was no comparison.

I wholeheartedly recommend Korean Airlines to anyone flying to Asia or Southeast Asia from the USA.",August 2016,"August 3, 2016",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
Flight on Korean Airlines...,Houston,Seoul,International,"Round the world and back again, that's the sailor's way....It has been almost a year since I took this flight, but I still remember it, how do you forget a 15 hour flight, good food, and everything you need to be entertained (movies, map guide,  tv, and games) on their little tv screen, wonderful flight attendants in the blue and white uniforms who gave the great service.( even if their English was a little bad, still reminded me of my mother's broken English, passed on many years ago, she was also from Korea.)  I ordered my ticket 2 months before  and chose my seat, and I must have lucked out, I had a window seat and a couple seats to myself, great for napping.  In my seat was a packet with a blanket and few little items for the flight,  I was comfortable in my seat and I am about little on the big side, (thanks dad) but had room to sit cross legged as I usually sit, I had bibimbap for one of my meals, very good and different. Long story short, I was very pleased with the flight, long but the quickest way to get to Korea, worth the extra money not to change flights. The restrooms are well kept, clean, and hope that the plane don't hit a turbulence with doing your business, could be alarming for a moment, LOL.  Don't forget to fill out your immigration card they pass out about 20 minutes before your flight lands, I had an attendant help me with it.  I flew in Economy, but tiny bit envied the first class, then I found out the price of their seat. Eh, that is price of a weekend at the casino plus high rolling, so my little green moster disappeared quickly.

Excellent Airline,Brisbane,Seoul,International,"First time flying KOR and I think it is one of (if not the best) flight we have had. A little delay at BNE, excellent entertainment, good food, great service, calm passengers and very smooth sailing. A a larger/taller person, I found the seats to be a good size width with comfortable leg room - very important for us. All the usuals items - pillow. blanket - and attentive staff to provide if you require anything more. The normal issues with carry on baggage where some passengers seem to take liberties with size and weight which crams your overhear area, but not too bad.

On board the staff were superb and the meals decent and tasty. I would rate them in my top 3 airlines with Virgin Atlantic and Icelandair. 

My only, very minor point was the movie entertainment was just, just slightly less than others and the on line booking in procedure to pick seats etc was more complicated. Apart from that top notch.",June 2016,"August 3, 2016",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,
Surprisingly good experience,Paris,Sydney,International,"Did not expect much, and other reviews on the net had prepared me for the worst.
Overall, very pleasantly surprised by the pleasure we took on our long journey from Paris to Sydney via Seoul.
First of all, the A380 has probably something to do with it. The wide body, the inside roomy feeling, the silence, it's all part of the experience.
The seats are widely spaced apart, amplifying that impression of quietness and relaxation, they recline almost 180 degrees, and are quite comfortable, but not real beds.
The meals are ok, not super impressive, and the cheese portions give you the feeling that it is meted out like caviar.
Enterntainment systems are good, not top of the list (Quantas seems more impressive).
The staff is friendly and quite attentive.
One remark : their English proficiency is less than adequate, and you can see the panic in their eyes if you ask them something : they simply don't understand or can't reply.",December 2015,"August 3, 2016",4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0
Good experience with excellent flight crew,Brisbane,Frankfurt,International,"My wife and I flew from Brisbane to Frankfurt with transit in Seoul. The check-in was easy with only a small delay primarily because we were early. Our seats were at the back and straight away we noticed that there was significantly more leg room than we were used to with other carriers. The Flight Attendants were friendly and very helpful. The food served was tasty and well presented. I especially enjoyed the Korean Rice Meal that seemed to be the selection of most of the passengers. I was even provided with a printed sheet on how to prepare this. The baggage came out quickly in Frankfurt. They were using two carousels but there was no indication of this and as a result caused some anxiety and wasted a bit of time. On the return trip, when we checked-in found that we were allocated separate seats but the counter clerk identified this and changed it.",July 2016,"August 3, 2016",5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Korean Air,Auckland,London,International,"I was very impressed with Korean Air and on a par with Emirates, Cathay etc which I have also flown. I try and get back to UK on a regular basis so need to get a good price as the cost is very high. Korean Air were by far the cheapest at the time I wanted to go and the compulsory stopover in the Grand Hyatt for one night in Seoul was amazing.

Best Airline Ever!,Chicago,Bangkok,International,"Excellent on time performance for every flight. Clean comfortable cabin area. You even see the flight attendants cleaning the toilets in flight. Every seat gets a pillow, blankets, slippers, bottled water, tooth brush and paste.
      Food is excellent, offering American and Korean meals. The customer service of the flight attendants is the best I have experienced. A 12 hour flight to Korea is enjoyable on Korean Airlines. Many people tend to stand up as soon as the plane hits the runway, knowing this, the flight attendants easily and nicely keep order in the plane.

Will definitely fly with Korean Air when possible,Toronto,Seoul,International,My husband and I checked in at Toronto Pearson about 3 hours prior to our flight.  The line was short and no issues.  I was asked to provide my credit card that I used to pay for the flights.  I already knew that as it was indicated on the itinerary so I had filled out the form in advance as well.  The flight was delayed about 30 minutes but no issues afterwards.  Boarding order seems to be about the same as other airlines (priority passengers then from the back to front).  Pros: Food was good. Better than Air Canada.  I recommend getting the bibimbap (Korean style rice with mixed veggies/meat and hot sauce).  The flight attendants were nice and water/beverages were served throughout the flight.  I also saw some passengers requesting cup noodle soup.  One of the snack choices included a kimbap (rice wrapped with seaweed in a triangular shape).  The flight was full but the washrooms were kept quite clean for a long haul flight. The flight attendants spoke Korean and English.  They seem to speak Korean first if you look Asian but will change to English once they know you are not Korean.  One Con:  The choices of movies were limited.  Air Canada has a better selection.  The remote control is removable which was neat but you can also use the touch screen.   The return flight was just as good except I didn't hear them announce the boarding procedure and we just lined up when we saw a line forming.,June 2016,"August 3, 2016",5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0
Mediocre Food & Poor Service,Toronto,Bangkok,International,"There was a very limited menu, appetizers & snacks were basically non-existent.   My wife & I wanted a couple of drinks prior to the dinner service but flight attendants brought the cocktails & food all together.   On the two lengthy legs we were asked once if we would like an extra drink and never if we wanted some additional food.  I tried to order some breakfast but it took 3 different staffers as the first two did not speak any English.   I complained to the senior attendant & was brought thin strips of per-packaged pizza in plastic sealed cardboard.  No fruit, yogurt, danish or eggs.  On the return business class flight from BKK there was nothing but spicy fish cakes.  At 5 K per ticket I expected much better.

"Marketing is to make sales useless, here is a typical case study for Korean Air",San Francisco,Seoul,International,"Korea air in SF int'l airport treats customers without barriers for new customer. I think the key function of marketing is to remove the gap either in physical distcne and in psychological one between customer and company-service provider. If we can make zero distance between customer and company-service provider, the company will be able to have perfect business model. Keeping current customer is easier than having new customers, and even it costs much more for PR and various promotion programs. And Korean Air team in SF Int'l is doing great to meet my theory. They have removed the gap. They treat their new customers introduced by current customer with the same level of warmhearted service culture.

Excellent A 380 experience ICN-JFK,Seoul,New York City,International,"This is an Airbus A 380-800.  After connecting in Seoul from Bangkok, I take this flight once or twice a year.  As a bigger person, I find the seats and flight in general very comfortable.  It is usually on time leaving and arriving.  It is a 14 hour flight, so patience is advised, but flight attendants are courteous, friendly and do everything necessary for your comfort.  2 meal services, that are very good plus snacks and drinks throughout the long flight.  There is stand up duty free shop in the back of economy and upstairs lounge for business class.  Inflight entertainment audio selection have been in use for a number of years, getting boring.  The A380 planes are very comfortable and smooth.  Flight path is north over Russia, the Aleutians, Canada and down into NYC.  Restrooms always kept clean.  Highly recommend this flight.",May 2016,"August 1, 2016",5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0
All around great service on Korean Airlines.,Bangkok,Seoul,North Asia,"This is an Airbus A 330-300.  The flight usually leaves late but gets in on time.  I take this flight once, sometimes twice a year, and then transfer on to flight to JFK.  Depending on weather there can be turbulence.  This flight was smooth.  Seat comfortable and flight attendants are always friendly, courteous, and happy, making the journey more enjoyable.  Meal service is a choice and palatable.  Transferring in Incheon is fast.  You do need to show passport, ticket and do security check again, Why ? From one Korean flight to another.  But they have more transfer stations than in the past so it goes quickly.  My only complaint is inflight entertainment, music selections not changed in years.  Highly recommend this flight.",June 2016,"August 1, 2016",4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0
It was quite an amazing surprise when we travelled by Korean air.,Sao Paulo,Los Angeles,International,"My first experience with Korean air was two years algo when I went to Los Angeles with my daughter.
What a wonderful surprise.

Everything reminded the trips to Europe years ago.
The elegance of their  attitudes towards everyone in the plane,the service was very nice.

From KUL to SFO,Kuala Lumpur,San Francisco,International,"My second experience with KE, first was in 2010 to Seoul. To be honest, I used KE was due to their very attractive airfare for USA-SF! This time the aircraft was newer and seats were better. Food selection were interesting. I enjoyed the flights. Although the stopover in Seoul to connect to SF was a bit longer (6hours++), but we had good time exploring the airport. The return connection from Seoul to KL after SF, was almost 24hrs, we put up a night in Seoul, explored the local food and had good rest after flying 13hrs from SF. Overall a good experience.

Los Angeles to Seoul - Airbus A380 Business Class,Los Angeles,Seoul,International,"I have flown three times on Korean Air.

Once non stop from Las Vegas to Seoul. Another from Seoul to Taipei. And last October I flew from Los Angeles to Seoul on the airbus a380.

Obviously, it is one of the newer planes in their fleet. From air quality, to lighting, to seat comfort, this is the Rolls Royce of airplanes. Business class has lay-flat seats. As for your amenity kits, they come with all the standard stuff. And slippers. 

The crew, they try to help you as much as they can. As for the food, 4 out of 5 stars. I actually found the meal from Seoul to Taipei my favorite.

"Excellence in flight..with some qualifications on their ""frequent flier program""",Los Angeles,Sao Paulo,International,"As far as I am concerned there is no other choice to fly to Brazil.  At the height of the Brazilian boom, the 777-300's were such great comfortable planes, even in economy.  Sadly, they have downgraded to a330's (DEF NOT AS COMFORTABLE) even in Business.  The service is top notch and I have flown them over 20 times on this route and it has NOT BEEN LATE ONCE.  Now, if you value frequent flier status and upgrades this is NOT  your airline.  After spending 10's of thousands of dollars and 22 ROUND TRIPS (OR MORE) I have never been able to secure bulkhead/emergency exit seats online and their rules for upgrading are NOT like the rest of the airlines i fly.

They are friendly and so helpful. 
Service is good. Clean, food is fine. 

I wish if they have more promotion for price. Because most of the time-around a year flights are not cheap. If they make some discount would be appreciate-able.

Flight is on time, flight crew are very friendly and sensitive to the needs of their passengers. Food is great, they offer continental food and of course, Korean Bibimbap. They also, offer free wine!

Flight Attendants That Our First Class,Los Angeles,Manila,International,"In January we decided to go to Manila for a little R&R.  We also wanted to visit Seoul so we flew Korean Air because we would get our 4 day layover with no added flight cost (maybe some airport taxes but well worth).

The flights took off on time. Planes were clean and interior in good repair (they would not allow me to look under the hood, so to speak), and the food and service was very good.  

OKAY, fasten your seat belt for this one; Female flight team between all the great service would go around to mothers with newborns and pick them up, walk and talk to them and thus; no crying babies.  Never saw that one coming.

Tip of the day:  you can take the fast train from the airport faster and cheaper than taking a taxi.  
We stayed at a Marriott downtown.  When we got off the train and went upstairs, we asked the locals where the Marriott was?  They laughed and pointed to our hotel about a couple of hundred feet away.  Actually until day 4, we didn't know you could go directly back and forth from inside the train/ subway station.  But wait, there is MORE!

Tip number two, hold on to your hats:  When we took the train back to the airport, Korean Air had a check in at the train station so you go back luggage FREE.  But wait, there is even MORE!!

Tip three:  Once checked in at the train, they stamp your airline ticket so you do not have to wait in a security line.  But wait,,,

Tip four:  Now that you do not have to go through security, GOOD LUCK ( unless you speak Korean) finding that magic unmarked entrance.  The SECRET location that no employee at the airport could tell us,, just go around to the left of where the regular line is and point to the stamp on your ticket and Smile.  Here you will bypass BOTH security lines.",January 2016,"July 27, 2016",5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,
Exceeded Expectations,Hong Kong,Los Angeles,International,"The flight from HK to Seoul was one of the best flight experiences ever.  The flight attendants were incredibly attentive & helpful and the plane was new & spotless.  

From Seoul to LA, the flight attendants were also very sweet and kind, and the plane was reasonably new, though not as nice as the HK to Seoul plane.  Seats weren't quite as comfy, with thinner cushions, but still adequate and reclined fully.  Food selections were OK, fine but not great (e.g., both starters had shellfish in them, silly really when so many people - including me - have shellfish allergies or dislikes), and snack options were mediocre.  There were raw almonds in the lounge area, which I didn't see til too late - that was a nice touch.  Also the 2 lounge areas were quiet and nice places to get up & stretch without disturbing neighbors, so I appreciated that.  

Where they really fall down is with respect to the video selections.  I think there were fewer than 25 movies and a very limited selection of TV content.  I'd encourage KA to upgrade this aspect of the flight and add a few more snacks & thicker seat cushions if they want to get to 5 stars.  That said, the flight was very pleasant and comfortable, and I would fly KA again without hesitation.  Bring a good book!",July 2016,"July 27, 2016",4.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0

I am fairly extrovert and can manage a few words in Korean, therefore I became a good acquaintance of the flying staff. They provide a very professional customer service and their food is delicious. I requested to repeat my dinner twice, and my desire was kindly attended. They offer bananas and also a selection of small snacks throughout the entire flight.

when choosing between north american airlines and asian...always pick asian,Toronto,Seoul,International,"This was my second trip with Korean Airlines, and again it did not disappoint. The economy class, rivals business or first class on many north american carriers, given the 13 hour flight, it's also nice to know that you actually get real food, (with real utensils!!) accompanied with decent wine. If anything it felt like flying through time when passengers were treated like people. 
The seats a spacious, and you have enough legroom  to stretch out every now and again. You are treated to a little bag of creature comforts (toothbrush, toothpaste, slippers headphones). The headphones come in nice and handy for those who haven't brought their own to enjoy the slew of recently released movies (they also have classics (a trip to and back 11 feature films)
 Given the 1st trip (where I flew cross-continent on a domestic carrier) this time, I decided best to fly as much as I could on Korean air.

Excellent but short flight,Seoul,Shanghai,North Asia,"My wife and I recently flew Korean Air as part of our trip to Asia. We flew in Business Class between Seoul and Shanghai.  Our flight was operated by an A330. 

Despite the short 2 hour segment we were served a good lunch with three choices. Headsets were provided and were available upon sitting down. A blanket and pillow were also at our seat upon boarding. 

My only issue with Korean on this trip is the baggage check in. This was the first of three segments and all were on one ticket. The agent would only check them to Shanghai which made it difficult in Shanghai. We had to clear Chinese immigration rather than just transfer. Then we had to drag our bags to the check in desk.

As amazing as a long-haul economy flight could be,Hong Kong,Auckland,International,"My flight was composed of 4 segments; 2 each way from Hong Kong to Auckland. First off, I must say my experience with Korean Air would be the best experience I have ever had flying economy class, surpassing the numerous premium economy flights I have flown on. 

At HKG airport, check in was smooth and done quickly. Boarding passes were issued quickly and the agent said our luggage could be checked directly to Auckland, even though we had a very long overnight stopover at Seoul. I had specifically chosen the first leg to Incheon to on the Boeing 747 (I noticed the width of the seat to be quite a bit narrower than the 777's, but as it was a short 3 hour flight it was fine), and was a joy to ride on. One of my favourite aspects of Korean Air would be the food, and thus I chose the Bibimbap (mixed Korean vegetables and beef rice) offering. It tasted extremely good and came with soup and metal cutlery. 

Because of the long overnight transit, Korean Air provided us with a free night's hotel stay at the Grand Hyatt Incheon, plus buffet coupons for dinner that day, as well as breakfast and lunch the next day (our flight was at 5pm the next day). The lady at the Transit desk counter gave these to us, and walked us to the free Grand Hyatt shuttle bus. I was amazed by the hospitality. As the buffet had finished when we reached the hotel, we were allowed to order room service food up to 66,000 won (roughly $83 NZD). In the morning, we thoroughly enjoyed the free buffet and went on a free Transit tour from the airport to the city. We returned to the airport at the end of the tour to make it to the airport just on time. Boarding was again done smoothly and my Dad and I took our seats. Beforehand when we booked our seats they had blocked the middle seat, however as the flight was full (I presume quite a few people went on stand by) that was taken. The first thing I noticed when I sat down was the amount of shoulder room (much more than the 747) and legroom (really spacious too). Before takeoff, amenity kits were handed out (included slippers and toothbrush). Meal service commenced soon after takeoff and I chose the Bibimbap again (which was again really tasty). 

I was really glad that all seats had PTVs, and the IFE selection was great and had some really good movies, compared to other airlines I have flown on. I fell asleep later for a while and woke up hungry, so asked a cabin crew personnel. They were really friendly and offered Korean cup noodles and a Maple cake, which came with a cup of water. When we approached Auckland, breakfast was served and although the food was a bit dry it still was really tasty. Security at AKL airport was smooth - collected luggage and went through immigration/customs in less than 20 minutes. 

The return flight was as good (got through Incheon without a hassle). As a summary, I would say Korean Air's hospitality surpasses many airlines, and the food, cabin crew service, seats, legroom were really good. The price of the tickets are also really reasonably priced.

I would definitely fly Korean Air again and am already planning to fly with them to Vancouver soon.",April 2016,"July 23, 2016",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Absolutely fantastic aircraft, first 747-8 flight between Seoul and Vancouver.
Seoul provides a fast and seamless airport experience. Boarding the 747-8 was a both a nostalgic and exciting experience. The plane itself brings back the best of aviation. The crew were quick to introduce themselves and get everyone settled. After take off we were provided with a drink (although no white wine). The meals were of good quality and provided a good range of both western and Korean meals.
The in flight entertainment could be updated and more options should be available, however it is not terrible and allows a good variety of films to watch.

Nice big entertainment screen, with good selection.
Plenty of unprompted refills, decent wine selection.
Overall a very nice and positive first experience flying Korean Air.
One minor nitpick: I didn't expect cauliflower soup and tomato/mozzarella salad on the menu of an Asian airline, this could be a bit more locally flavoured.

And the big one, and the reason I will not fly them again despite the great service, is the temparature in the cabin. I had read about this before on other travel websites, but now that I have experienced it I have to agree, this is madness.
It is way too hot in the cabin(same at Incheon airport btw), but I must assume this is somehow company policy with Korean Air, otherwise they would have listened to customers by now.

1st. Class in all regards,Los Angeles,Bangkok,International,I've had the opportunity to fly on Korean Air to Asia on several trips. Without exception they have performed with professional excellence. Singapore Airlines aside Korean Air is putting out service and facilities every bit as good. My only comment is that some of the flight attendants do not speak excellent English. There are always several on-board where English is no problem and the Purser seems to assign their best English speaking staff to serve English speaking passengers.

They aren't the lie flat seat and if you have some regular height it doesn't really work and you can get a much better business class seat on another airline. I haven't flown first class on this airline so I would expect that is the way to go with Korean Air. Other than that, the staff is the most polite in intergalactic civilization. The planes are new.

You know the small bottles of liquor you have to buy for a fortune on an airline? it's all free here. of course, they only give two but its a lot better than other airlines.

As with past flights, online flight information is simple to obtain, online booking is quick and easy. Flight check-in was efficient and expedient.

Our flight between HKG and ICN was quick and fine. Economy class seats were spacious and comfortable, allowing a couple hours of sleep in between take-off, meal and arrival. Flight departure and arrivals were on time, service was great throughout our flight. 

Layover at Incheon was fine. There are coffee shops and duty free shopping available early in the morning, comfortable seating near departure gates, free wifi that is stable and fast, allowing us to get some work and emails done in between flights. 

Onward flight to IAD was very good. Economy class seats were again spacious and comfortable, allowing several spells of sleep during our nearly 14 hour flight.  Service was timely, efficient and incredibly friendly throughout. 

Two in flight meals were sufficient, similar thoughts on the in flight entertainment. A fair number of movies and TV shows provided good ways to kill time during the long flight, which departed and arrived on time. Luggage arrived on the baggage carousel just fine.

The service is based on SERVICE. That comes with a smile and utter efficiency and politeness. The staff do not 'clump' up and down the aisles looking stressed and annoyed at having passengers on board, as many of trans-Atlantic flights do!
The food is excellent in both Business and economy. (Both experienced many times).
The amazing benefit of travelling this route with Korean, is that they put every passenger up for overnight stay in Grand Hyatt Seoul all included and provide luxurious accommodation and dinner and breakfast all included with you airline ticket. They do not tell you this the first time, so it is a great surprise and delight.

Inflight entertainment was good with a wide selection. Definitely kept me entertained and made the journey feel shorter. The timing of our arrival into Houston was also nice. There were no other queues from other flights except ours which made our immigration clearing quick.

Overall good - every year 5-10 times,Seoul,Shanghai,North Asia,"taking this carrier several times per year, on Prestige Class either from Beijing to Seoul, or from Shanghai, both routes are fine and rather short-haul. Like their cabin atmosphere better than Japan Airlines, everything is held in blue-green leather, even in Business Class all leather, but a lot of plastic all around their seats and aircraft. Drawback: they don't offer towels in their lavatories, but advantage: they offer mouth-wash. Slippers and head-sets rather belong to Economy Class, not to a business class seat.

Worst airline food ever,Brisbane,Seoul,International,"No complaints about the service or the range of on board entertainment - but be warned - the food served on this airline is of very poor quality. They really should sack whichever firm does their catering! No one expects airplane food to be cordon bleu - at least in economy class- but this is easily the worst offering I've ever had.The attempts to cut costs were very obvious, with the ratio of meat to noodle/rice being such that one was lucky to find more than two or three small grisly bits of meat at all. The accompaniments were soggy and flavourless.

Customer is the KING,Mumbai,Vancouver,International,"The experience starting from booking the ticket, was fantastic. I had booked with their Mumbai office and the treatment I got from Zaffar and his team made me feel like royalty. They gave me right advice about the fares expected to drop in the days following my first booking request. Further when I had to change my return travel I was rightly advised not to go for the fare difference payment and request for a lower class booking where I may not have to pay the fare difference and I actually got a call from the airline when the my request was accepted and the airline was ready to change my flight schedule at no extra cost. In flight services - never seen the inflight team take the concept of service with a smile to the level it is practiced at korean airways. All the air-hostess without exception seemed happy to do their job and were very patient and accommodating to the wierdest passenger requests. I was deeply touched when I saw an airhostess massaging the feet of an old lady co-passenger who was visibly in distress with her aching legs. Also the special meal requests made in advance were noted and linked to the passenger seat number and were serviced in a flawless manner.

Great Experience,Seoul,Los Angeles,International,"Great experience!!
A380 was amazing, flew from Incheon to LA, then JFK back to Incheon, both travels were lovely.

The only downside was probably that the subtitles on every film was only Korean, though I could understand English perfectly, sometimes the noise on the planes are just too loud to hear anything, so I prefer reading.

Leg room was good as compared to other airlines that I have traveled so far.

I had ordered special meal. To my surprise, they managed to maintain the Indian taste even for other flight starting from Seoul in South Korea.

Comfort and Efficient,Brisbane,Istanbul,International,Flight from Brisbane Australia to Istanbul and back was fantastic. We had great service and nice food. The cabin was dimly lit for sleeping and the loos kept relatively clean. On the way over we had a 20hr layover and Korean airlines paid for a 5 star Hyatt Hotel at Incheon and buffet dinner and breakfast. This alone really made us fly with them. On the way back we were allowed a stopover (no extra cost) and had four days in Seoul which we thoroughly enjoyed. Not sure why more Australians do not use this option to fly to Europe.

Great flight terrible ground support,Fukuoka,New York City,International,The flights are great but the ground support is nonexistent. When they canceled our flight they had promised hotel vouchers for our day in the airport. Not what we had planned for our vacation. They canceled our flight while we were on vacation so we were trapped. Instead they sent vouchers for the business class lounge. We were flying business class so they sent us nothing!

Flying made pretty and comfortable,Jakarta,Seoul,North Asia,"Flying with Korean air is easy, efficient and comfortable. 

Online check-in is made easy, language barrier is not a problem since they provide visual aids they need to ensure smooth communication with their customers. Baggage arrival was fast and efficient. 

The cabin is pretty with my favourite colour (so yes I may be biased), but the seat is comfortable and all facilities I need up to USB plug is available. Seat is comfortable, not necessarily spacious, but for my size, it is pretty cosy. 

The food however is not really to my liking. Not too sure if it is because I requested for a vegetarian meal, but they can do better. 

I also wish to have more english speaking movies and TV series options in the in-flight entertainment, especially for long-haul flights. 

Cabin service is up to its standard. 

When passing the business class, I did notice that the seat in the business class is relatively small (as if it is designed for Asian size). But I did not experience it myself so I wont talk more about it.",March 2016,"April 20, 2016",4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,

The staff (who, incidentally, are all extremely good-looking, both male and female) were very attentive and polite, and the amenities were excellent. The passenger bag includes slippers, plus tiny toothbrush and toothpaste, etc. In flight entertainment offered a choice of very recent films, plus games and TV programs, and even Kpop music. Certainly the TV selection wasnt as wide as other airlines, but the selection also included some Asian/Chinese films. In general the film selection was good and I caught up on Star Wars, Steve Jobs, The Big Short, Hunger Games Part 2 as I didnt see them when they came out on film circuit. Meals were good although the Korean option, the bibimbap, was a little dry and wasnt a great example of how good Korean food can be. The offered cutlery of knives and forks were genuine metal and felt reassuring to use. Staff always exuded professionalism and friendliness. Leg room on the A380 was also very good, although I struggled trying to find a comfortable position to sleep, but that could just be me.

On-line check-in not working so had to take the seats allocated which were not great (given 2 out of a row of 3). Called the airline to choose seats, told couldn't until at Airport and of course once at Airport told too late. Not a lay flat bed on first leg, food not great, lounge in Auckland just a sharing lounge with various others incl Priority Pass. 20 hour layover in Seoul but no paid for accommodation.

Beware!!,Washington DC,Siem Reap,International,"We purchased two round trip tickets, PAID IN FULL, in May, 2015, for our vacation in Feb. 2016.  Between purchase and the flight, we had several emails from Korean Air about time change, seat change...no problem.  
When we get to the airport, they will not honor our tickets because we did not have the credit card the tickets were purchased with.  The CC had expired and when the new ones were issued, the number was different.  They then wanted to see our bank statement from May, 2015!  Who would have that on vacation?  We had full ID in passports, etc. but they acted like we were trying to pull a fast one.  
We had to give them a new credit card and had to purchase two new tickets for over $3,000. dollars!!!  And they had the nerve to say there would be no price difference.   Luckily, we could do this, but I would think many people could not.  After about a month, the credit came through on the first tickets but that does not begin to account for the stress and aggravation this caused.  
In this day and age, when CCs get changed often and people have multiple cards, it is unreasonable to think a person would carry every card they had used. 
We felt very ripped off and insulted!!!

Great way to fly half way round the world,London,Auckland,International,"We had a terrific experience flying KE from the UK to New Zealand, out in Feb 16 and back in March. It's two long (11-12) flights via ICN. Outward bound we had two overnight flights with a 2.5 hour layover to change planes at ICN. We aimed to stay awake as much as possible on the first flight and then crash on the second. As a result we got about 6 hours sleep on the second flight and arrived in AKL early in the morning as refreshed as anyone can be flying for 24 hours with a 13 hour time difference.
Coming back the flights don't connect so KE pays for a night in a hotel with dinner and breakfast included - we got the Grand Hyatt on the edge of the airport. Together with two daytime flights and a night in a proper bed in between we again arrived home in reasonable condition, much better than I feared.

One slight discomfort is the temperature inflight, it seems a bit warm for my liking and the first trip i was a bit uncomfortable, but 2nd time around I brought a change of clothes that kept me just right.

Korean Air good pick for Asian travel,Los Angeles,Seoul,International,"The flight attendants and ticket takers were very polite and helpful.  The airplane was configured in three rows of three.  My husband and I booked a window and an aisle and hit the jackpot as no one sat in the middle seat between us.  The legroom is comparable to the economy plus option on Delta so it was very comfortable.  The food was decent--choice of Asian or western menu items.  Several amenities were offered including a toothbrush/toothpaste and slippers.  The individual entertainment center at each seat was somewhat limited as to options but was satisfactory. 

Please note:  In LA and in Siam Reap (our return flight) this airline will only allow you to check in a few hours before your scheduled flight time.  This means you cannot get beyond security or get rid of your bags until shortly before boarding. This can be important information if you are in the airport well before this.

Long Journey but with Great Service,Seattle,Denpasar,International,"This was my first time flying Korean Air and I would do it again. I choose this airline at the suggestion of a friend, he said you have to take this route and stay at the Grand Hyatt Incheon.  The food was great, on time service and all my luggage arrived with no damage.  My only complaint was that they serve very small beverages and the cup is only ever half filled.  For such a long flight I went through all my bottles of water I purchased and had to keep asking for more water.
The on board entertainment system was above average and complimentary. The first leg of the trip was on  Boeing 777-ER and the seating was comfortable and the legroom was generous better than any US Based carriers I have flown.  The second leg of the was on an airbus, I have to say I have never been more miserable in a seat.  This seat was so uncomfortable, the plane rattled and made noises that were disconcerting. Having been in the airline business for 10 years these noises made me a very nervous passenger. They were not normal airbus tin can noises, but rather the center luggage overhead sounded like it was going to fall down on our heads.",February 2016,"March 13, 2016",4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,

Korean hospitality at its best - a trip to remember!,Nadi,Seoul,International,"I have traveled with Asian airlines before - but there is something about being treated as a VIP guests from the moment you enter to the moment you leave.  Hosts, both male and female are well groomed and trained as best possible hosts and you feel the centre of attention. Politeness, courtesy and respect can only be reciprocated when offered in such elequent ways.  The food combines through Korean fare and superb a la carte.  Apetizers, entrees, mains, desserts and cheese - not many business class offer five-course dinners that are delivered with a Michelin three star service. This has now become my airline of choice when traveling from the Pacific to Asia and Europe.

Long trips made almost bearable,London,Auckland,International,"Korean Air provides planes which are clean and well maintained and the standard of service provided by staff is very good.  Seats are adequate the IFE is not too bad.. plenty of films even if they are not so good - that's not KA's fault!  Meals are adequate but of course with a heavy Eastern influence - for breakfast I would have killed for a decent egg and sausage meal!  Staff are excellent and always attentive.  A good airline I think .. I have travelled the long route from London to New Zealand return on several airlines and would certainly consider flying Korean Air again.
In addition Korean Air provided a dinner, bed and breakfast stopover in Incheon in a five-star hotel free of charge which must be worth a lot when the ticket was reasonable anyway",February 2016,"March 5, 2016",4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,

Flown on several long-haul flights before, I was surprised that Korean Air don't provide amenity kit for my flight. They have earplugs and other items if you ask them.

They KNOW how to take care of customers,New York City,Bangkok,International,"WOW.  You certainly do not go hungry about Korean Air flights, that is, if you are an adventurous eater.  We loved the food, even the non-Americanized stuff.   Even when we missed a flight due to delays, they not only got us on the next flight for free, they also gave us food vouchers for meals in the airport!    Also, because of a delay, we only had 30 minutes to board our connecting flight - the flight attendants ushered us into first class before landing, so we'd be some of the first ones off the plane.  They also had workers escorting us through security, and guiding us to the next gate, and making sure the plane did not take off without us.  Although they are notorious for speaking ""Engrish"", they understood when there were potential problems, before we could call it to their attention.  Another thing to note:  those 14 hour flights can be rough, especially with crossing time zones, and jet lag and such.  Korean Air uses cabin lights with a dimmer;  they slowly come on and it feels like morning, then they dimmer off and it feels like evening.  It helps your body know when to go to sleep or wake up.  They do the lights this way for meals, and I honestly think they time it to help with jet lag.  If you sleep when the lights are off, and are awake when they are on, I don't think it messes with you as badly.  Also, there are touchscreen computers for each seat, so there are games, music, movies and TV shows to help pass the time when you are awake.  What an airline!  I really hope to fly with them again.

Excellent economy class flight between HKG and JFK,Hong Kong,New York City,International,"We had a very nice flight with Korean Air to New York City's JFK Airport from Hong Kong with connection out of Seoul last October. This was one of several good economy class flights we have taken with this airline in recent months.

Flight information is easy to look up on the airline website. Flight times were appealing and online booking reservations are quick, easy and confirmed by email in an acceptable amount of time.

Check-in for flights at HKG airport was quick and easy, luggage made transfer in Seoul and arrived on the carousel at JFK in a timely fashion.

As for our flight, no real complaints. Economy class seats were as comfortable as you will generally find with long haul carriers. Leg space is fine. In flight entertainment is fair, some decent movies to watch. In flight meals are sufficient, the Korean rice (bibimbap) is actually pretty good.

Connection in Seoul wads fine. This is a clean, tidy and nice airport with free fast wifi throughout the departure area. Lastly, airline attendants are incredibly polite and pleasant throughout both flights. These might be amongst the best in the industry.

Business Class - Heathrow to Auckland via Seoul,London,Auckland,International,"Decided to go business for our trip to Nz due to the length of the flight and the fact we'd be going straight back to work following day getting back. 

Business class is brilliant with this airline, the service is top and the food is several courses or more depending on the time of meal. There's several options for the mains course and there are lots of snacks to have during the flight in between. 

Seats are comfortable and plenty of room particularly so in the new layout which is getting spread across the fleet. 

The staff are friendly and really helpful.

Depending on where you fly from the lounges are good. Heathrow is exceptional and to you get priority security clearance through both ways although London is rarely busy as its so well operated. 

Auckland business lounge is okay but nothing special.

Airline attendants are so very polite and pleasant with Korean Air as well. TV programs are more limited than other airlines but there are enough options to keep you occupied during long flights to North America. Meals are sufficient. The Bibimbap is surprisingly good for airline food as well.

"Excellent, except...",New York City,Manila,International,"I took a round trip from NYC - JFK to NAIA Manila, Philippines with stopovers at Incheon Airport in South Korea in January - February 2016.

I highly recommend Korean Air. Just about everything went right. As with most things, the most important factor is the people. The staff is polite, prompt, happy, well dressed, and speak in great English. The only downside is sometimes they passed over me when handing things out. Perhaps this was because I was in the window seat or maybe it was just me. But I would like to see better responsiveness. The food and drink is plenty and frequent and most importantly delicious. There's a wide variety of beverages from beer and wine to tomato juice. The facilities were clean. For the 14 hour flight we were given blankets, toothbrushes, toothpaste, pillows, headphones, and slippers. The media selection was -excellent-. I chose from very popular, recent movies like Steve Jobs, Sicario, Spectre, etc. Oh, and they were one of the cheapest airlines I found. 

Overall, I will go out of my way to fly Korean Air on my next trip to the Philippines.

Efficient Service Courteous Staff Pleasant Flying Experience,Auckland,Mumbai,International,"I am glad we flew by Korean Air on our trip to New Zealand - we had a very pleasant flying experience.
Right from online web/mobile check-in - the efficiency was evident. 
We had asked for Indian Meals - Vegetarian for my wife - and the food was wholesome and tasty. 
The in-flight staff were most charming and polite - and served food, wine, snacks with finesse - and also attended to our needs in a most polite and professional manner - and all the staff were all smiles despite the long flight. 
Thanks to the excellent in-flight entertainment and good seating - we had a comfortable flight - though the flying time was quite long. 
I truly admired the promptness and most efficient manner in which the Korean Air staff transferred us to our connecting flight which was departing from another terminal at Incheon Airport (Seoul) in a record time of 30 minutes and transferred our baggage to the connecting flight in this short time. 
Only one suggestion - I wish Korean Air includes Indian Music (old Hindi movie songs) and Indian (Hindi) Movie Classics in their ""in-flight entertainment"" to cater to the increasing number of Indians/Asians flying by Korean Air. 
I enjoyed my flights with Korean Air.

Seats were good and a couple of hidden secrets 3 rows form the back two seats together stack of leg room, last two seat recline full giving you all night reclining without bugging others, yes close to the loo but not annoying. They provide a free stopover and transit when flying with them. Check in on line speeds line process up, generous carry weight provided, although get on quick as they fill the overheads very fast. I would fly with them again.",December 2015,"February 7, 2016",5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,
Doubts proved baseless,London,Auckland,International,"We flew business clas from the UK to NZ, stopping over in Seoul. I have done this trip a number of times with different airlines and when younger in economy.
Booked the trip over the web for a great price, but not without some doubts. Especially when a friend reassured us about the 16 hours stop over in Seoul on the return.
Any doubts were dispelled during the course of the trip when we received exceptional service from all Korean Air staff.
I felt I never had enough paperwork to support any of the flights or the stop over hotel stay, but all this concern disappeared when we showed our basic documents, everything fell into place. It seemed everyone we came into contact with at Korean Air and the Grand Hyatt were fully informed about us. Service from start to finish, in the air,at the airport, at the hotel and over the phone was exceptional.
The flight out to Auckland could not have been faster with only 1 stop and minimal wait between flights. 
Food on all flights was excellent.
Hotel in Seoul, organised by Korean Air was brilliant.

Only niggle was the 777 is a noisy plane, the 747 is better and the 380 spoils you, once you have flown on a 380, everything else falls short. When you are on a plane for 22 hours, noise is a major factor. One way to mitigate this is to take good quality noise cancelling headphones.

Bottom line, we will now not fly on any other airline to NZ.",January 2016,"February 5, 2016",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,
Superor in every way,Paris,Sydney,International,"Couldn't fault any part of the journey that Korean was in charge of. Flying to Australia is in two parts Paris-Seoul, Seoul-Australia; the only part that let the trip down was returning Seoul to Paris which was combined on Air France and that leg was rubbish. I will definitely fly Korean again but I will check whether there are any combined flight legs and who with. The food and leg room on Korean Air is superior as is the service.",January 2016,"February 5, 2016",5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,,,
Absolutely Wonderful,Atlanta,Singapore,International,"Originally booked Business Class seats but was fortunate to receive an upgrade to 1st class on outbound flight. I don't believe it would be fair to compare the level of service with all other airlines, but limit the comparison to airlines that routinely receive outstanding grades. (i.e. Singapore, Emirates) Anticipating 22+ hours of flight time was not high on my ""wish"" list. However, every aspect of the trip was excellent. Started with check-in where they wrapped luggage in plastic. Once on board, the service by helpful, professional flight attendants was outstanding. All amenities including pajamas, Bose headphones and futon for sleeping were unexpected but very welcome. Food & wine selection was excellent and service only ceased when you told the attendants when you wanted to sleep & when to wake you. The return trip was nearly as spectacular. The upper deck on the A380 is all Business Class. Not quite as many amenities but more than enough for a long haul flight. The separate stand up bar is a welcome feature. Allows room to stretch and engage other travelers if so inclined. I would highly recommend Korean Air for any Asian destination. The only shortcoming appeared to be scheduling. If you are connecting in Seoul, be cautious of connecting times. The airport is very active and you have to go through transit customs, which can be time consuming. Also, due to a late departure from Singapore, missed our connection in Seoul and had to spend a day at an airport hotel.(Hotel & food compliments of Korean Air)",January 2016,"February 5, 2016",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,,,

superb,London,Auckland,International,"Travelling alone and having overnight stop in South Korea.  Was a bit nervous about the transit component.

need not have worried, well organised - information provided in LHR and NZ before embarking on first of the two flights each way.

Very comfortable 11 and 12 hour flights, seats recline fully, plenty of leg room and some flights had privacy screen you could raise between yourself and next seat.  The airbus seats (747 upstairs)  were less comfortable than the B777 - could feel what appeared to be metal bar of the seat when reclined.

Some speech over the trannoy in flight unintelligible but did not prove a problem.

Overall I thoroughly recommend because of organisation, communication, comfort and overall service",January 2016,"February 2, 2016",5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,

A 5 Stars Airline....,Sao Paulo,Los Angeles,International,"Traveling from South America to the US its usually full of overly expensive flights with crappy services, except the route serve by Korean between LAX and GRU. This airline its by far the best in the market transamerican market offering a premium service, high tech aircraft and a very comfortable cabin. 

With a 3-3-3 configuration in a 773, this aircraft its comfortable and well design to permit even bigger customers to relax. The service from the crew its simply magnificent with an amazing level of patience with a particular noisy audience. The food its well planned and the entertainment its not the best but way better than the competition in the market. 

What amaze me the most was the high level of coordination and accuracy to maintain the schedule and manage the multiple connections specially with such a difficult airport as the the GRU. Still, one of the best flight experiences ever and by far the best in the market.",August 2015,"February 2, 2016",5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,,,

The Worst in the World,Houston,Seoul,International,"Business Travelers if you have a choice do not pick Korean... Does not work for us...

I have bought my ticket, received confirmation, printed ticket and went to the airport.  I got the counter and I was informed my ticket was cancelled.  They were so bad that they did not know I am a business traveler and have bought it using a travel agent and I have not only my paperwork as well as Korean Air ticket printed from the web. 

Anyway, after the news came the worse - the manager in the airport returned my ticket and said he can't do anything...next customer please...  I felt very bad and honestly I do not know how Korean air can have in charge someone that speaks very bad English and has a very poor customer service...  Fortunately I could afford another ticket and in less than 60 minutes I re route my trip and I was in the business class of ANA (Nippon Airlines).   Exceptional job done by their agents... .",January 2016,"January 30, 2016",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,
Torture.,Seoul,Brisbane,International,"I fly this route once a month and I absolutely dread this 9hr flight. It really fatigues you and would not be a great start to a holiday of a lifetime.  The main issue I have is the cabin temperature is ridiculously high and makes for a very uncomfortable flight. At first I thought it might have been me but I have witness many other passengers complaints. This is the not just unique to this Korean flight in general the Koreans seem to prefer warmer inside temperatures so traveler be warned I would not fly Korean Air if I did not have to

One of the worlds best airlines.,Los Angeles,Bangkok,International,"Flew from LAX to Thailand through Seoul. It was like the ""old days"" on US PanAm! Flight attendants all within 5 years and 5 pounds of each other and impeccably dressed and made-up during the flight. Food was good and entertainment better. Attendants go out of their way to serve you. LAX to Bangkok was an Airbus 380. Very new and smooth. Coach window seat is roomier near the window due to the shape of the fuselage.

Leagues Above Our Own,New York City,Seoul,International,"Flew with my husband and children and it was the best flight I have ever been on. I am not a fan of flying, but this flight was smooth. You have an option of American or Korean meals, and they also offered multiple snacks. The kids got kiddie baggies with snacks, toys and things to keep them entertained on the flight. Each seat has its own screen, with movies, tv shows, music, and games. You can also check to see your flight progress. Each seat comes with an amenity bag with toiletries, slippers, blanket and such to keep you comfortable during your flight. Aisle space is ample if you want to get up and stretch, and head space is plenty if you are tall. Our plane was an airbus with two levels. Staff was attentive and always available to passengers.
