Extremely Poor service with Swiss when something goes wrong.,London,Zurich,Europe,"Looking forward to my Swiss flight on the 21st November. My troubles started with the cancellation of my flight to Zurich due to adverse snowfall there. I went to the Swiss Airside representative, they were under a lot of pressure. As I was on an interconnecting flight to Sao Paulo they took details and passed it on to a rebooking clerk. Please note that the re-booking clerk had absolutely no clue or care of the size/logistics of Heathrow. I was rebooked on a flight to Paris with Air France from Terminal 4, whilst I was in Terminal 2. This wouldn't be a problem if they adequate time between terminals, navigating security, and getting to the boarding gate. I had less than 30 minutes to do this, which clearly was not possible. Bear in mind I was airside at terminal 2 at the time. I went back to the check in desks, to ask there advice, they cancelled the Air France flight and arranged a LATAM airlines flight to Sao Paulo, however the rebookings clerk really didn't have a clue or care or both. I was sent to terminal 3 which is close (5/10 minutes apart), HOWEVER the reservation had NO booking reference or ticket number, the checkin staff at LATAM had already left checkin as it closed 90 minutes before departure. I had no way of getting on the LATAM flight as I couldn't obtain a boarding pass. 

My wife who wasn't travelling with me had found a British Airways Flight to Sao Paulo on the airlines website with availability to fly at 22:10 that night. Plenty of time to get on the flight. I then returned to terminal 2 to the Swiss Air check in. Other customers were also there that had been allocated new flights that were impossible to catch. By the time I was seen, over 25 minutes later, I was told the only flights avialable would be the following night. I asked them to check the BA flight, which they said was now sold out.

This is a very abridged version of events. Whilst I absolutely accept that weather events happen, this is when if this was even half managed properly, I would have been on a flight that night and not missed a days holiday in Argentina and the ongoing consequences.

To add insult to injury I did place a complaint with Swiss, along with expenses and twice the response has been dismissed.

It is when something goes wrong that the measure of a business is brought to the fore. This goes to show that SWISS falls short, and is not a quality Airline who resects their customers.",November 2024,"December 17, 2024",1.0,,,,1.0,,,1.0,
Horrible experience - no food left in business class,Los Angeles,Zurich,International,"I fly 250 hours a year and I love Switzerland and the Swiss way so I thought I‚Äôd book my family on Swiss air business ,  I booked 2 business and 3 economy seats.  Absolutely horrible in both sections. My kids and wife in the back said the flight attendant was swearing in French, moved my daughters medical supplies to another cabin to find space for another guest - then in emergency we couldn‚Äôt find our medical bag. In business they didn‚Äôt have enough food for my mother who sat next to me. They had four options and by the time they got to us they said ‚Äú sorry all the guests in front have taken all the meals, only meat options left. ‚Äú. Then I asked about how to drop my arm rest and was told‚Äù you can‚Äôt ‚Äú then I did it myself after 2-3 mins of playing with it. Talked to the manager and supervisor and he didn‚Äôt care either and said ‚Äúour flight crew don‚Äôt even have enough food we just eat the left overs ‚Äú. That was their response.

SWISS AIR CREW PUT OUR BABY‚ÄôS HEALTH IN DANGER ü§±üèª,Budapest,Zurich,Europe,"Swiss air‚Äôs stewardesses took out of the airplane our baby bag just minutes before take-off LEAVING OUR BABY WITHOUT HER SPECIAL MEDICAL FORMULA, DIAPERS and necessities FOR 8+ HOURS. 
The reason for that? A Swiss lady wanted to occupy our (!!) seat at the window, so while we were a few meters away (talking to my husband who sat in different row, whereabout the same stewardesses were informed by me at boarding) according to the lady, the stewardesses assisted her and without asking, removed from our dedicated seat (!!!) our butterfly shaped baby bag and full baby bottle and gave it to the airport staff just closing the door and sent it back to the airport, not caring about our desperate complain. üò¢ 

In our final destination our checked-in luggage was also missing, including rest of our special baby formula, leaving her without her nutrition at night in a foreign country. ü•∫

Absurd price for luggage,Nice,Sao Paulo,International,"I am writing to request a refund for the absurd fee I was forced to pay at the airport. 

The situation was as follows: I bought a ticket and it only included a 23kg bag, but I needed to add another 23kg bag -  I tried several options on the Swiss website, but it would only allow me to upgrade to Business and not add another bag because I had a flight with another airline.

That's when I decided to call and they told me that it would be possible to add another bag but that I could only do it at the airport. I called another airline too to check about it and they said that they didn't even have access to the flight details (because I had bought it with Swiss). On the phone with SWISS, they assured me that I could buy the second 23kg bag and put in a Request note that I had requested the bag before but it wasn't possible to add it because I could only do it at the airport, but they assured me that they wouldn't charge the airport fees because I had requested it before the 48 hours. At the airport they charged me a ridiculous fee of ‚Ç¨260 to check in an extra 23kg bag. Not even the things I have in the bag are worth that amount, but I needed to take all my clothes with me. 

I explained everything that had happened to the lady at the airport and she told me that it would be possible for me to have added the bag over the phone (but they told me no) with this attendant and that even if I went to the airport to buy the checked bag days before the flight, they would charge the same amount because it was the airport fee she said and it wouldn't make any difference if I had gone earlier. She said that I did have the right to complain writing the email and she encouraged me because n it even the crew staff agreed of this fee, that this was absurd what they did to me. What option would I have???? I tried to add it days before the flight and it would be blocked in the system, the lady assured me that it would be ‚Ç¨70 to check it in (which is the normal price) I demand that they evaluate my case and refund me this outrageous amount and be fair with me).

I paid money that I couldn't afford to check in this bag, I'm in a very bad emotional state because I had to make this trip and they still do this to me. 

Please be aware of your real customers, I continued to use Swiss and I hope you value your service, I am really sad about this situation.

Hope to hear from you soon with a solution,

"Most appalling service ever. OK if you manage to get on your plane, but no customer service or care if you don't. Avoid,",Manchester,Johannesburg,International,"The worst customer service possible. Our flight to South Africa was connecting in Zurich. Our flight from Manchester was delayed and we did not make or connection. We told staff at check and asked what would happen, they were totally indifferent. When we arrived at nearly 10.30 in Zurich, it was chaos, no one could tell us what we should do. We received different information from swiss air representatives. Eventually we were told to book a hotel, pay ourselves and we would be re-imbursed. We would also be booked on the following days plane. 
We were. Rather than a direct flight, we were booked to Milan. Addis Ababba and then Johannesburg. We were all split up (party of 4) and had to sit individually. All we asked told us our bags would arrive. We decided to get them back and book them back onto the Ethiopian Airways flight we were being put on. Only to find our luggage was lost and they didn't know where it was! We arrived a day and a half late onto a dream safari holiday.
Swiss Air would not pay for the delay, because they said it was not their fault. They did however agree to pay our overnight expenses, although for some reason it wasn't the amount we provided receipts for - and they sent links that did not work. After 4 months, I have still not been able to get them to pay the money they agreed to pay. There are no numbers to ring and emails are not responded to, other than there is a long delay in responding due to the high workloads - no surprise with the customer service they provide.

That was the last I knew about them...

Fast forward four days and countless calls with customer service: each rep tells me something different. First, my bags are ""en route"" with delivery in 48-72 hours, despite the initial information telling me that they would be delivered the next morning. Then, they're ""still within the 72-hour window"" (which apparently has no defined start time and seems to be different from my landing time). One rep says a local company is delivering my bags, another says it's Groundforce delivering them. I even got a second email TODAY saying the delivery company NOW has my luggage... four days after the first email said the same thing. ü§Ø Honestly, it feels like they're either clueless or lying to my face. Either way, it's not a good look. This isn't even about delayed luggage; it's about broken promises and a complete disregard for the customer experience.

Swiss Airlines, you delivered me safely and on time (thank you,) but you failed spectacularly on bringing my baggage at the same time which, remember, is ALSO part of the service. And your customer support? Let's just say it needs a serious upgrade. And this also looks bad for Star Alliance as a whole.

As of now, my bags are still lost in some kind of Swiss Airlines/Groundforce timespace distortion vortex, and I'm flying back to Singapore tomorrow. Whether the suitcases show up today or never, you've lost a customer Swiss International Air Lines.

Avoid SWISS on longer flights as they operate aircraft from stone age,Zurich,Dubai,International,"Well well. Okay, in the end, SWISS is Lufthansa Group that should have been warning enough. Its a pity but I read some good things about SWISS in advance, and so I was not prepared for what I discoverd. First of all, they operate those nearly 7 hours flight from Zurich to Dubai with an Airbus A330-300 aircraft that has been assembled shortly after the end of stonage. Ok, using old aircrafts thats typically part of Lufthansa DNA.

This plane has so little seat space its rediculous ‚Äì under your feet there is hust half the normal space, as they have placed a metall box there that contains I think the entertainment systems electronics. So, if you are taller than 1,65 m, you wont find much space for the next 7 hours of flight. The reason ‚Ä¶ when this aircraft was taken into the fleet, passengers entertainment ment just radio programs that a pax could find and direct from his armrest and there was a CRT monitor on the ceiling showing movies for all the eco guests. When SWISS updated the cabin, they went for personal tv screens however it seems they had no other solution than putting the needed electronics below the seats. This could be a tolerable solution in the year 2010 but in 2024 its rediculous. An airline that offers its passengers on a 7 hours flight such a torture with lack of foot room can't earn any positive points.

Plus, the seats are small as well. As a passenger sitting on  the aisle seats, the arm of my neighbor from the left all the time touched my breast und my left arm was sleeping after the fli flight as I found no place where to rest it.

Broken seat - no refund,Zurich,Singapore,International,"I initially booked an economy seat and paid an additional 132 CHF for extra legroom‚Äîa premium cost, but I wanted a more comfortable flight. At boarding, Swiss announced an opportunity to upgrade to premium economy, which I decided to do for an additional 480 CHF.

Unfortunately, my experience in premium economy was far from satisfactory. The seat I was assigned was broken, repeatedly returning to the upright position, leaving me with a very uncomfortable flight. While the staff attempted to assist, there was no resolution, and I had to endure the broken seat for the entire journey.

After the trip, I contacted Swiss to address the issue. After some time, they responded, agreeing to refund the seat reservation fee for economy but declining to compensate for the premium economy upgrade. Despite several emails back and forth, I am still waiting for a resolution. I believe it is unfair to pay for a premium seat that was faulty.

Three and half hours is a lot so I decided to ask for a refund. Swiss confirmed the refund request on 2nd October 2024.

I did not receive any money for following 2 week so I filled their form and ask what was happening. They replied they I am not qualified for a full refund and that they will return only part of the money and in CHF (not in CZK). What??? Honestly, it looked more like an AI generated reply.  I replied to them that I do not agree. Since that I filled another form and ask what was happening.

Today is 23rd November 2024 (52 days after the refund request). I have no money and no reply from Swiss. Absolutely nothing. No information online. My experience is that even low cost air lines treated me better than Swiss. Most likely, this was most my last purchase with Swiss.",November 2024,"November 22, 2024",1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,
Poor experience with Swiss,Wroclaw,Zurich,Europe,"Swiss became a really bad airline. Honestly, prices went up significantly since 2020 but the service is a misunderstanding. The flight we were supposed to take was canceled on the day of travel. We got rebooked to the next day, super early flight via Warsaw. No information about the hotel. Tried to contact Swiss, long waiting times and no answer. Went to Lufthansa since it's the mother company, answer: pay hotel yourself and then request reimbursement on Swiss website. They couldn't propose other connection despite on that day there were multiple flights to Warsaw, Munich, Frankfurt or Dusseldorf where it was totally possible to change to Zurich.

Their service is absolutely appalling and communication is atrocious!

We have filed for compensation 23rd of September and we was disappointmented with the unfair outcome and the appalling response from their consultant Unaisi Gaunavinaka.

Our flight was delayed on their behalf which made us miss our connection flight. On our arrival to our connecting flight, we received no help, no accommodation and were stranded at the airport for the night.

After waiting the night, we were finally able to get some sort of help,however, the member of staff was rude and not apologetic. After confirming the flight that we rebooked over the phone, they advised us to contact Swiss customer care online and give us the EC 261/2004 compensation information to get compensated.

Not to mention, on our return flight, our first flight was delayed too. Fortunately we made our connecting flight, however our suitcases didn't and we didn't receive our suitcase until a week later.

When the suitcase arrived, we were missing one and we received no further communication regarding it, until another week passed and we finally received our missing suitcase.

The consultant said we are not entitled for compensation because of the country was that your journey departed and arrived in countries in which the regulation EC 261/2004 does not apply and that consequently said the regulation does not apply to your itinerary.

The consultant was not able to provide us with the EC 261/2004 policy on their website and answer why the airport staff gave us the
EC 261/2004 information to get compensated if we are not entitled to it.

Instead of asking our question, the consultant decided just to close my case, which I found very rude.

Worst Airline ever - Rude and Arrogant staff running a scam,New Delhi,Birmingham,International,"I had booked a flight with Swiss Airlines from Delhi to Birmingham, with a layover in Zurich. Unfortunately, our journey was marred by multiple issues that I believe Swiss airlines already knew about and hence they are running this scam.

1.Missed Connecting Flight:  Due to a delayed departure from Delhi, we missed our connecting flight in Zurich, resulting in an 8-hour delay. We were stranded at Zurich Airport , Despite our inquiries, we received little support or assistance from the airline staff at Zurich Airport.
2.
Rebooking Only to London
: Instead of rebooking us directly to Birmingham, as per our original booking, Swiss Airlines only managed to rebook us on a flight to London, causing further complications in our travel plans.
3.
Confusion and Delay with Ground Transportation
: Upon arrival in London, I was informed that our onward travel from London to Birmingham would be by train. However, after passing through immigration and collecting our baggage, I discovered that the arrangement was actually a bus transfer instead of a train. This unexpected change, combined with only 90 minutes to manage immigration, baggage, and ground transport details, added substantial stress and delay to our journey.
4.
Delay in Arrival at Final Destination
: Originally, we were scheduled to arrive at Birmingham Airport at 8:00 am, but due to the series of delays, we did not reach home until 9:45 pm‚Äîa delay of nearly 14 hours.
5.
Unprofessional Conduct by Airline Staff
: Throughout this ordeal, we encountered rude and unprofessional behaviour from both the in-flight crew and the ground staff at Zurich Airport. This treatment only added to our frustration, as the staff seemed indifferent to the concerns of passengers affected by the delays.

Its defiantly a scam and Swiss Airlines are running this scam to steal money from its victims. The flight from Delhi LX-147 delays giving very little time to catch the connecting flight to Birmingham (LX-420) which is from another Terminal at Zurich Airport , even if the flight lands on scheduled time 06:20 AM , it is not possible to catch the connecting flight which departs at 07:00 AM. Even if someone manage to reach the gates, it is never possible for them to transfer the luggage to other airplane in such a short time, hence its a scam. Similar is the case with connecting flights to London Heathrow airport.

I have registered the complaint but have no trust in this scam airlines if they'll refund and compensate me.

Appalling: Swiss air tried their best to ruin our honeymoon.,Berlin,Colombo,International,"- We paid over ‚Ç¨1500 each months in advance for two return tickets to Sri Lanka from Berlin and NOT ONE SINGLE FLIGHT was operated by Swiss Air.

- Firstly, when our honeymoon was meant to begin, they denied boarding to my wife and I in Berlin because they'd overbooked the flight and they claimed the whole time that it's standard procedure and legal for them to do it. Despite us pointing out that we had two other connecting flights, they denied boarding to us and about 10 or more shocked, distraught, and horrified passengers who couldn't understand why this so-called reputable European airline was treating them like dirt. Swiss Air's practice of ""legal 10%"" overbooking is utterly disgraceful and completely unethical - a fact they did not deny, but instead dryly pointed to their assertion that it's legal for them to do it - perhaps to quiet those who have their lawyers on speed dial. Swiss Air are essentially selling you something they cannot or will not deliver and are therefore employing scam tactics.

I have never been treated with such contempt by an airline, and that's including the likes of the notorious low cost European airlines. So well done, Swiss. You're officially the worst.
 
- Back at the BER Lufthansa check-in in search of a desperate second option after having been dealt the trauma that our honeymoon is likely in tatters, plus the further embarrassment of exiting security and being forced to pick up our own bag, Lufthansa couldn't offer us anything so they instead approached the good graces of QATAR. It was a lovely, understanding guy from QATAR Airways who ended up delivering a last minute miracle by squeezing us onto a much better and faster QATAR Airways flight. 
In the end, we actually arrived in Colombo earlier than planned due to the great connection with QATAR. This one employee from single-handedly saved our trip whilst nobody from the Lufthansa group seemed willing or able to assist us out of a nightmare situation.

I wish that were the end of my review, but the journey home, which was also meant to be with Swiss Air, was almost equally as awful. 

- Our SriLankan Airlines flight to Mumbai was cancelled so Swiss rebooked us with a SriLankan Airways flight to Frankfurt, but only to Frankfurt. We booked at return trip from Berlin! They also completely failed to notify me of the flight changes. I only noticed because I wanted to make sure we were guaranteed a seat by checking in online, as I assume with great confidence this was their initial unspoken reason for denying us boarding in Berlin (because we didn't give them extra revenue by choosing seats or adding any extras to already overpriced tickets)

- Frantically, with my phone and hotel Wi-Fi, I was able to get through the useless Swiss Air AI-chatbot and explain to an actual human being that they still needed to get us home to Berlin, not Frankfurt.

- If you're still reading this, you're probably as perplexed at how poorly we were treated up to this point.

- The only positive thing I can say about Swiss Air is that they gave us 250‚Ç¨ compensation each, which we used as spending money on our honeymoon, but this aside, I will never, EVER book with Swiss Air again. I'm even going to apply for more compensation since a 17-hour journey with SriLankan airlines is not what I paid for and thought they got us home, it was 12 hours later than planned. (SriLankan is also an airline I'd stay far, far away from)

Bottom line: Swiss Air will take your money then outsource the actual flying to other airlines. They are the worst, the absolute worst. Avoid at all costs.",October 2024,"November 3, 2024",1.0,,,,,,,,
Taking Back Control,Malaga,Nice,Europe,"I write this review to express my deep dissatisfaction with the service my family and I received during our flights and the handling of our subsequent compensation claims. Over the last two years, Swiss Airlines has been our airline of choice for business travel, with my family having exclusively booked, or flown, with Swiss in Business Class, completing 16 Business Class segments from 2023 to 2024. I have been loyal to your airline, even opting for Swiss on a recent transatlantic journey in May. However, after my recent experience, I regret to say that this loyalty has been broken due to what I consider unfair treatment and deceptive practices.

In June, I booked Business Class tickets for my family and me from Malaga, Spain (AGP), to Nice, France (NCE), for the dates June 30 to July 10, 2024. The reservation, totaling ‚Ç¨1,250.37, included four flights operated by Brussels Airlines: SN3734, SN3621, SN3618, and SN3737. Despite making the booking via the Swiss Airlines application and selecting Business Class, Brussels Airlines failed to deliver the promised level of service and subsequently denied compensation. Here are the issues encountered on this trip:

1. Diversion and Denied Assistance
On June 30, our flight to Nice was diverted to Marseille (MRS). Despite being ticketed to Nice, the supervisory flight attendant (Purser) announced in three languages that Brussels Airlines would not provide transportation assistance to the final destination, insisting that all passengers make their own arrangements and submit receipts for reimbursement. This situation left us stranded in a foreign city without the support expected from a Business Class ticket. The Purser, upon noticing passengers recording this announcement, became visibly agitated, which further highlighted the lack of transparency in their handling of the situation. Forced to rent a car, we arrived in Nice 5.5 hours after our scheduled time. I later submitted a claim for compensation and expenses totaling ‚Ç¨258.71 (for car rental, fuel, tolls, and parking), which was denied.

2. Failure to Deliver Business Class Service on Return
On July 10, during our flight from Brussels to Malaga, I was seated in Business Class (Row 1) when Brussels Airlines seated a newborn baby in a car seat in the middle seat beside me. The baby was wonderful, but occupying the middle seat directly contradicted the Swiss Airlines Business Class guarantee of an empty middle seat, as per my reservation and your website. Both flight attendants on board acknowledged the error and agreed that this seating arrangement violated my ticket class terms. Nonetheless, my request for compensation or a refund was dismissed.

This experience did not meet the standards I have come to expect from Swiss Airlines and Brussels Airlines. The contract of service for Business Class was not honored, and both Swiss and Brussels Airlines have declined to offer due compensation for the inconvenience, additional expenses, and breach of the ticket agreement. This is not about tyhe compensation money, but rather the disrespect and disregard for my family.

Very Rude Host,Tokyo,Amsterdam,International,"Our experience on Swiss Airlines flight LX 161 from Tokyo to Zurich left us disappointed. Originally, we were booked on a direct KLM flight to Amsterdam, which was canceled, forcing us to reroute through Zurich with Swiss and lose a day of work.

The service was notably rude. A specific stewardess (initials G.M.) was dismissive from the start. When my friend politely asked for a snack during this 14-hour flight, she gave him a lecture on why passengers should bring their own food. Eventually, she gave him a sandwich but later insisted he couldn‚Äôt have another, even though the same sandwiches were handed out to other passengers with plenty to spare.

Further, when I requested tea during a water service, I received a sharp ‚Äúabsolutely not.‚Äù Moments later, we saw another passenger receiving Baileys from another steward. This led to a tense exchange where the stewardess scolded her colleague openly in front of all passengers. Throughout the flight, she showed similar disregard for others, lecturing passengers about minor issues and creating an overall uncomfortable atmosphere.

On the morning of my departure, I received my electronic boarding pass confirming my seat 5D. Throughout the day, I received no communication or notice regarding any changes to my reservation, which left me feeling secure about my seat. However, after comfortably settling in, I was abruptly interrupted by a flight attendant who informed me, in a disrespectful manner, that I should not be seated there as that seat belonged to business class.

The shock and embarrassment I felt were immense. I showed her my boarding pass, but she insisted there had been an error, claiming the aircraft's configuration had changed during the day and that I had not been informed of the alteration. How could this possibly be my problem? I did not care about the class of my seat; what troubled me was the fact that the airline had failed to update my reservation correctly!

Instead of receiving a respectful solution, I was forced to get up, exposed and humiliated, while all the other passengers looked on. This situation not only left me embarrassed but also made me feel like an intruder in a place where I should have been welcomed. The lack of consideration and care from Swiss was unacceptable.

It is simply intolerable that an error on the airline's part resulted in such a degrading experience for me. I sincerely hope that Swiss takes the necessary measures to ensure that no passenger has to endure such a humiliating and disrespectful situation again.",October 2024,"October 31, 2024",1.0,,,,,,,,
Atrocious Inflight Service,Johannesburg,Zurich,International,"Awful inflight service received from the cabin crew. 
1. Did not receive my dinner (gave them the benefit of the doubt thinking they were just busy so I waited but still nothing) 
2. Got up to speak to someone on the way to the restroom only to find them eating and was told there was only one option left which I agreed to (as if I had a choice - it was either that or starve). Not to mention the flight attendant I spoke to acted as if I was being completely irate for saying ‚Äòyes I would like my dinner please‚Äô in a stern manner.
3. When I returned to my seat, a tray of food was left with a bread roll that was hard as rock and a half eaten salad with the cling wrap clearly torn open which is a massive health violation.

Forced to check in hand luggage which is now damaged and irreparable. Offered less than half of the value to replace it.,Amsterdam,Dubrovnik,Europe,"To Whom It May Concern

This was the last response we gave regarding our luggage claim.  The airline admitted they damaged our luggage to no repair after forcing us to check in our hand luggage.

All we asking is for a fair compensation of our damaged luggage. 
¬† 
The value you they offered does not allow us to replace the luggage quality the¬†airline¬†had damaged. They are not taking responsibility for the damaged luggage which they have admitted to damaging.  They insisted we check in our hand luggage due to their plane being to small, the ticket we bought was for 1 check in and 1 hand luggage.  
Our hand luggage would not have been broken if we had been allowed to keep it with us on the plane, this is what we paid for - hand luggage.  On top of this, our luggage set is ruined. We paid for 4 matching items of Samsonite lite luggage which has now been broken up due to the one piece they broke.  

On top of this.  We especially booked a long layover, to visit the city Zurich, we were meant to head in to the city but we spent the time looking for our luggage, whilst trying to carry all our belongings from our suitcase like laptops, chargers, books etc without a bag, and spending time trying to file a complaint for damaged luggage once we arrived in Zurich.¬† Due to this there¬† wasn't enough time for us to go into the city as we had planned, we had to spend the rest of the time sleeping on the airport floor.

They should at least pay in full the luggage they broke.  All we are asking is a replacement of the exact piece or similar quality in the same brand.¬†I can't even go into the site (not getting access)  to see what the measly amount they are offering to replace our luggage allows us to buy,¬† I think it is a cheek of the¬†airline, expecting us to ""pay in"" to replace luggage the¬†airline¬†has damaged.",September 2024,"October 28, 2024",1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0

Swiss quality is no longer - how to improve,Zurich,Boston,International,"My experience on my recent long-haul flights was mediocre. On the plus side, the cabin crew was friendly and responsive to passengers' requests. On the flight to Boston, the cabin personel were experienced, whereas on the flight back, they were very young and, though always polite and well-intensioned, rather inexperienced. I would recommend more thorough training of cabin personel, plus a higher proportion of more experienced staff.
On the negative side: The seats were narrow and too closely spaced; average to worse even than some of Europe's short-haul, budget airlines (Ryanair, EasyJet). Dropping things on the floor in front of your seat means that you will have trouble picking them up again, simply because the spacing is so small. The box with the electronics for in-flight entertainment under the seats takes up about a third of the foot room for some seats, severely limiting foot- and legroom, depending on where you sit. Please mount these boxes somewhere else (!) and increase the distance between seats! The choice of inflight-entertrainment, the quality of the entertainment screens and the breadth of  in-flight information on Swiss has decreased markedly over the years. Fix these deficiencies, please! The main dinner was ok, though definitely not up to the standards of the past. The small meals (snack before klanding, breakfast) were eminantly forgetttable, in the case of the 
Check-in in Z√ºrich was fast and very good, in Boston it was efficient, but the personel  serving me there spoke only limited Engish, and zero German or French (surprising for a Swiss airline).
In short, Swiss (especially its predecessor, Swissair) was an exellent airline. Unfortunetyl, standards in Economy Class have fallen and the airline seems to be concerned with competing with some other airlines in a race to the bottom. A first step to improvement might be to take better arilines as positive examples (e.g., Turkish Airlines).",October 2024,"October 25, 2024",3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0

I'm a frequent flyer and i fly a lot every month. I totally agree with the Bvlgari CEO that Swiss Airline is the worst!!!! They charge you  a high amount with a budget airline service. Easyjet and Vueling cabin crew is way better. Flying business with  Swiss air is not worth the money as the seat looks more like Economy premium.

Air Canada Cabin crew service going to Toronto was waaay better! They were all very helpful and will ask if there's anything i can help you with.

Refund process on refundable tickets,Zurich,Dubai,International,"I decided to cancel (my decision) our holidays in UAE, so after spending many minutes on their customer service FAQ and discussing with their silly chatbot, I managed to find their phone number.
I had bought (for 2 passengers) refundable tickets with 260.- Swiss francs refund fees.
These are the steps of the whole process :
1) 15 min on the phone with a lady : you need to get your reservation code ready
2) She will tell you the amount of the refund fees or the amount of the refund amount (this was not very clear to me as her French was so so)
3) The reservation disappears from your account, so be cautious to save the document with all the details of your tickets (reservation number, conditions for change/refund,...)
4) No e-mail or whatsoever to confirm the cancellation and the refund to come
5) Second call : they could confirm that the process was completed, but no e-mail received
5) The day after my second call (so after a total of 8 days of worry, because no e-mail received), the refund was on my credit card : total amount paid less twice 270.- ; they won't refund the extra options you paid (seats, extra luggage,...)

Overall I'm happy with the refund process, it was quick and I didn't expect to get ""only"" twice 270.- as fees. I tought I would have to pay twice 270.- per passenger.

So I wrote Swiss air for said letter and then fell into a black hole. Meaning you have to fill out as contact form and then No One Ever Responds. This department, I was told, is inaccessible by phone. And here I am, 4 months later, still waiting for a response. Of course I am pretty sure Generali Knew Swiss Air wouldn‚Äôt come thru, which is undoubtedly why they directed me to this impossible. After all, they already had a copy of my  ticket info which clearly stated the ticket was in refundable 

So this review is as much for travel insurer Generali  as it is Swiss Air‚Äôs pathetic customer service. FYI, I have called both and was told they would expedite my case to no avail. So now I have no choice but  to trash both. 

In all likelihood I will never attempt to travel Swiss Air again nor will I ever purchase travel insurance ever again, at least from the relatively highly rated Generali.",June 2024,"October 4, 2024",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
Outdated inflexible policies that make lose-lose deals for customer,New York City,New Delhi,International,"I have to agree with the one star reviews here. In this post-COVID era, airlines need to offer customers more flexibility with booking. $199 USD to change your flight - WHA??? And that too, you cannot change the destination - just the date. So they lock you in, and you're left with the choice either to lose hundreds of dollars or pay ridiculous amounts just to change dates. And they don't care if it's a lose-lose for the customer. What a sucky policy.

"Worst, most uncomfortable flight experience in my life, frequent traveler, both US domestic and international",Portland,Palermo,International,"I fly a LOT and this was, by far, the worst experience I've ever had. We paid $92 per person to upgrade for extra legroom, which gave us barely more legroom than a cheap seat on Delta. The whole plane was such a hot box everyone was dripping w sweat. The seats felt like wooden folding chairs and the smallest person our party (wears a size med men's US) filled his set entirely. This meant the rest of us were basically sardines in our uncomfortable, over heated chairs. The staff were friendly enough, though every time they brought the carts down the aisles, they bumped it along the seats all the way down. The aisles are so small everyone had to walk sideways down them.

To top it all off, they forced us to check our carry on, stating it was ""too large"" (which was the same exact size as everyone else's, and I measured in advance for compliance). They then promptly lost all of our luggage. We have no clothes and no toiletries, the replacement of which, even for a couple days in hopes they find our stuff, is costing us into the hundreds. (Large party of 6) There's no live person to speak with on the matter, so we had to place an online report. They located our luggage but the report says the ""rush delivery"" won't be for another day, possibly two. They offer no compensation and refuse to work with us in any way. I'm actually crushed that we have to fly home with this airline because I already know it's going to be torture again. If I could afford to book on another airline and just eat the cost, I 100% would. We will NEVER fly this airline again. And, the group we met up with at our destination won't either.

Deplorable Customer Service at Zurich International Airport,Zurich,Canton of Geneva,Domestic,"I had an incredibly deplorable experience with SwissAir customer service at Zurich International Airport on September 15, 2024 while connecting to my flight to Geneva.  The behavior of the two gate agents- particularly the male agent was absolutely disgraceful. Their lack of basic customer service skills and professionalism was shocking, and in my opinion, their actions were racially motivated.

The male agent pulled me aside and demanded that I check in my carry-on suitcase, claiming it was ""too big.""  I calmly informed him that my bag was within SwissAir's stated size limit even showing him the official email with the exact measurements.  Yet, instead of offering any explanation or engaging in a proper dialogue, he repeatedly insisted it's big, ignoring the fact that other passengers with similar or larger carry-ons were allowed through without any issue.

When I pointed this out and questioned why I was being singled out, the male agent became visibly hostile, raising his voice, rudely asking, ""What's your problem?""  His dismissiveness and aggression escalated the situation.  He falsely claimed to have checked every other passenger's luggage, which was clearly not true.  He pointed out that I have 2 carry-ons which I explained that I have one carry-on, one personal bag and a medical device, in line with SwissAir's allowance, yet this did nothing to improve his treatment toward me. 

When I called out the male agent's rudeness and asked why he was treating me like a nuisance instead of a paying customer, he became visibly upset and even threatened me, asking if I ""wanted to fly"" and warning that he would weigh my bag and make me pay extra.  His aggressive attitude, lack of professionalism, and outright hostility were unacceptable.

What stood out to me during this entire interaction was that the other passenger who was similarly pulled aside and asked to check his bag was an Indian male.  I an Asian female was subjected to the same treatment. 

To make matters worse, when I finally boarded the plane, I noticed that the flight was far from full, with many empty luggage bins available.  I asked the flight attendant about the situation, and she casually told me that the carry-on selection was random.  This only added to the frustration, as it was clear that there were no real reason for singling me out, further reinforcing my opinion that my treatment was discriminatory.

This experience left a bitter taste in my mouth. It felt like SwissAir was not only ignoring its own policies but also discriminating against passengers based on race.  I will seriously reconsider flying with SwissAir in the future, and I urge others to be cautious of the appalling level of customer service at Zurich International Airport.",September 2024,"September 27, 2024",1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0

I need to warn for Swiss Airlines.,Berlin,Stockholm,Europe,"Warning for flying with Swiss Airlines.

After a wonderful honeymoon in Italy, on our way home from Naples to Stockholm, we had a connecting flight in Berlin. The flight from Naples was delayed, causing us to miss our connecting flight from Berlin to Stockholm, and we were forced to buy new tickets. We chose to book with SWISS (booking reference L7MUHA), which, for this flight, used an Austrian Airlines plane.

Upon reviewing our booking confirmation email, we discovered a significant error, a booking bug or technical glitch: my husband's name was listed twice on both tickets, and my name was entirely missing.

The following morning, when we arrived at the airport to check in for our flight, we were informed that neither of the two tickets (both issued under my husband's name) could be used for me. As a result, I had to purchase a new ticket at a cost of just under ‚Ç¨1000, even though the original tickets had cost approximately ‚Ç¨1314 combined.

Since then, we have called both Swiss and Austrian Airlines numerous times and sent several emails. Austrian Airlines has repeatedly redirected us back to SWISS, and vice versa, for almost two months. We have filed two complaints and refund cases with reference numbers 2408-LX-18828 and 2408-LX-18831.

During one of our calls with SWISS Airlines, we were even advised to physically return to Vienna Airport (!) because the flight reference number (L7MUHA) had been canceled from the SWISS system and could no longer be retrieved by their staff. This was despite the fact that the flight had taken place just last month and was still visible to Austrian Airlines earlier that day.

Their customer service has been completely unacceptable, seemingly aiming only to delay the process in the hopes that we would eventually give up. We haven‚Äôt seen any genuine intention from either airline to resolve the issue or to refund us for these tickets.

When we arrived in Vienna, which we had to travel through to get home, it was highly uncertain whether I would even be allowed to board the flight (due to being fully booked) despite the sum we had already paid for the tickets.

Ultimately, this entire ordeal, resulting from a delayed flight, has cost us approximately ‚Ç¨2,400 ‚Äî a problem that should have been incredibly simple to resolve.",August 2024,"September 23, 2024",1.0,,,,,,,,

Big middle finger up to Swiss Air!!,Bangkok,Barcelona,International,"I am not the best person on long flights I can't sleep and find I can get a bit stressed. During this flight I became unwell and leaving the plane after the first leg of my flight (11hrs) I found myself in the toilets in Zurich airport in a bit of a state throwing up. Consequently I fell asleep waiting for my next flight (right at the gate for my 2nd leg of the flight) from Zurich to Barcelona. I woke up 20 mins after the flight departed disoriented and in a panic. Went to the transfer desk to explain my situation. The very rude hostess didn't want to know. Said I had plenty of time to catch the flight and I would need to go to the check in desk. I followed signs to check in which leads you outside to arrivals and of course couldn't get back in. Given the time of night I was at the airport there was no one around to talk to. Also feeling weak and unwell I needed to lie down. I called a friend who told me to go to the capsule hostel across the street and booked on another flight with a different airline for the following morning. Costing me quite a lot. To make matters worse when I finally made it to my destination. I tried to check my return flight only to find my booking code didn't work anymore. I tried to contact their live chat which is just an AI robot with generic responses, when asked to chat with an actual person it freezes. I found a few phone numbers which work but you get transferred to Egypt or India where they tell you your flight was a no show and as you are on economy they automatically cancel any further bookings ( my return flight) without notification or any other option other then to book another flight. No compensation only refund of taxes. I don't recommend this company if you are an average person. It seems unless you are business class you are of no importance. Even the staff checking the luggage in Zurich airport were incredibly rude. I got told off for having my toiletries in 2 transparent plastic bags instead of one like it was a massive crime.

"Horror experience with Swiss: Cancelled flight,False justification  for refusal to Pay Due Compensation",Bucharest,Zurich,Europe,"I recently had a deeply frustrating and unpleasant experience with Swiss Airlines on a flight scheduled to depart on August 21, 2024, from Bukarest to Z√ºrich. After boarding and being kept on the plane for over 30 minutes, while the plane was rolling away from terminal for take-off, the captain informed us that the lavatories were not functioning. He then suggested that anyone who couldn‚Äôt ""hold it"" for two hours should disembark. Strangely, the plane was already rolling on the tarmac, and the captain had just announced we had received permission to take off.

Despite this, the cabin crew asked passengers if they wanted to disembark. After several of us protested that we couldn't endure a two-hour flight without functioning toilets, the captain finally decided to taxi the plane back to the gate. Once we were in the terminal, we waited for another hour, only to be told that the toilet issue had still not been resolved. After four hours of delays, the flight was canceled.

At no point were passengers provided with water, food, transfer back to city or any form of logistical support. There was no assistance in organizing overnight accommodation or transportation. Passengers were left completely on their own, with no help whatsoever from Swiss Airlines. I had to personally pay for transportation back to the city, accommodation for the night, and meals and transfer to airport next day which was an added frustration to an already stressful situation.

Arriving in Z√ºrich with a 24-hour delay caused me significant problems and financial loss. The lack of any support from Swiss during this entire ordeal is absolutely unacceptable.

Following this, I attempted to submit a compensation claim, as is my right under EU261 regulations. However, Swiss Airlines makes this process unnecessarily difficult. The compensation form DOES NOT EXIST on their Switzerland page. It is hidden within the Germany page, and I only managed to find it after calling customer support, who first advised me to use a ""refund"" form, which is not the same. Making it impossible or hard to place a compensation claim is completely unacceptable for an airline of this size.

After finally submitting the claim, I received a response from Swiss Airlines' Customer Feedback Services, denying my request for compensation and reimbursement of expenses. Their justification? The flight was canceled due to ""unforeseen safety issues."" This excuse is entirely false. At no point did the captain, cabin crew, or ground personnel mention any safety concerns. The plane was almost taking off, the captain  wanted passengers to ""hold it for 2 hours"" while he got ready to fly. So obviously he had encountered no  ""unforeseen safety issues."" The only issue ever communicated to passengers was the malfunctioning lavatories. It is absurd to claim that a toilet malfunction is an   ""unforeseeable safety issue."" just in order to deny paying due compensation according to EU261 regulations. 

Swiss Airlines‚Äô attempt to use this excuse to avoid paying compensation is not only dishonest but also a violation of passengers' rights under EU261 regulations.

Overall, my experience with Swiss Airlines is deeply disappointing. From the poor handling of the delay and cancellation to the lack of any logistical support and the ""hidding"" and making hard to apply for compensation and the dishonest response to my compensation claim, Swiss Airlines showed no care for its passengers. The 24-hour delay caused me great distress, financial loss, and serious personal inconvenience. I strongly urge others to reconsider before flying with this airline, as their treatment of passengers is far below acceptable standards.",August 2024,"September 11, 2024",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Priority boarding went really smoothly, cabin crew was very friendly and welcoming. Business class seat was pretty spacious (really essential for me as I'm a tall person). Crew was present and attentive offering the assistance. Meal was tasty - it was a salmon, Swiss cheese served with fresh bread as far as I remember. There was also a juice selection as well as tea and a mineral water.

Stay away from the horrible airline,Olbia,San Francisco,International,"Words cannot describe what a horrible airline this is. The staff, the customer service, their policies, everything about it. They should be shut down. I had to change one part of my flight due to a medical situation. I couldn‚Äôt find a customer service phone number to contact them only an online chat. The experience chatting was awful i barely got my flight changed. I paid the difference in fare plus fee and was told
I‚Äôd receive the new ticket information via email sometime in the next few days. My new flight was 6 days away. The evening of the 5th I tried to check in and was unable to access their website booking manager with my code. It said my flight had been cancelled. I went back on the chat and was told by the representative I was connected with that the ticketing office was late in reissuing my ticket, never did it and so therefore the flight was canceled. So at midnight the night before I am supposed to fly I have no ticket or information about the flight. And also unable to select a seat. I explained that I already rebooked and paid the fees. The representative replied the only option was for me to pay a second time. At this point i honestly thought I had been in a scam. I googled Swiss air and the same site came up. So then I thought maybe I had been hacked and they were asking me to pay again because this sounded crazy to me. The airline refused to issue my ticket. Finally after telling them I thought it was a scam since they were extorting me, they said ok upon further checking we will reissue your ticket. At the check in at the airport I explained the situation of what happened and that I had a medical situation requiring special seat assistance the airline staff refused to assist me unless I paid a large upgrade fee. After all the stress they caused me, having to stay up all night with no ticket and not knowing my information they asked me to pay again. They said to talk to the station manager. When I arrived at the gate I asked for the station manager and it took talking to 4 people and 1 hour later he finally arrived and he did absolutely nothing to assist even though I explained about my medical situation.

Swiss Air First Class to JNB,London,Johannesburg,International,"LHR-ZRH- typical middle seat empty, style Business Class. I slept for part of the service, and upon waking, not one Flight Attendant asked me if I wanted anything- there were four of them servicing the Business Class cabin. The Crew in general were not engaged.  
ZRH-JNB- The First Class Terminal E gates lounge was exceptional. I was greeted and asked immediately if I would like a beverage as I stood outside on the viewing deck. I had a meal in the dining room which was very nice as was the Server.   Boarding was quite organized for the ZRH-JNB flight and I was acknowledged at the boarding door.  There were two Flight Attendants in the First Class cabin on this A340-300 aircraft. Although pleasant, I found one to be robotically friendly, and unfortunately witnessed her and two male passengers in row 1 flirting throughout the flight. I preordered the Sole and was never offered any appetizers ( was looking forward to the Balik salmon and more- quite disappointed  ). The dessert was difficult to cut into with a fork.  I did enjoy the flat bed and the privacy of the seat ( 2A ).  
Breakfast was a bit unusual, although I had seen in others' vlogs that there are items not mentioned on the menu, some were shared with me, and I decided on a light offering, yet did not receive everything I requested.  The Captain walked around the cabin and only thanked about half of the passengers, which I found not only awkward, but so obvious- he flirted with a female passenger sitting in 2D, and spoke with someone in length in 1D.

Swiss nightmare cancellations,Corfu,Boston,International,"I have never in my life opened my phone to write a bad review but this experience was so horrible I‚Äôm compelled to do so. I booked a flight home August 29th from Corfu, Greece, to Boston with a layover in Frankfurt. I booked this flight through swiss, which is the airline I flew with to Greece, but for the flight home they booked it through discover airlines. I‚Äôve since learned that there was some sort of pilot strike in Germany that began August 27th, two days before this flight occurred, which felt like they could‚Äôve been more proactive in rebooking flights in advance but that‚Äôs honestly the part that irritates me the least about this experience. We were automatically assigned a new flight, for August 30th which was a day after we were originally supposed to leave. We called Swiss customer support trying to remedy with this, each person offered either no solution or different  solutions that all ended in us leaving days later than intended which no place to stay, I was looking up flights myself and saw 3 different options for leaving for the intended day. They were able to put me on a flight for the 29th and then told us the flight was full and recommended my friend be put on a waitlist and that all that they had to do was call someone to get it  approved and then she would get in. They described that the whole process would take less than an hour. When it took more than an hour we called again and the next person told us the waitlist never works and that they didn‚Äôt know why anyone would recommend that. By putting her on the waitlist they took away the flight they re-booked her for leaving her with no way home. They later tried to claim she refused the flight that she rebooked (likely to void her of being able to get a refund, further help?) which was not the case. They also indicated we had to go to the airport to get hotel accommodations or be rebooked through another airline so we went to the airport that night in Corfu and everyone was incredibly rude in the office, telling us they are unable to rebook flights in that airport (which Swiss said was impossible when we called and that that was our only option). They also told us there was no flights until September 2nd anyway. And then asked if we just wanted to end up somewhere in America like Atlanta or Chicago. Despite also saying they couldn‚Äôt rebook which felt contradictory and also no we don‚Äôt want to just be stuck in Atlanta ??? When asked about hotel accommodations they recommended we sleep on the stairs outside. This whole experience was making me start to lose faith in humanity. We went back to the airport at 6am, were offered no help again until my friend ultimately had to buy a nearly $1000 plane ticket home and hope that Swiss would refund her for giving her no way home and no way to get accommodations in the country we‚Äôre in. Her flight didn‚Äôt even go all the way to Boston it ended in New York. Only once she got to her layover in London, the connecting flight was delayed until morning and she ended up stuck in London overnight with still no help, and having to book a hotel. My flight back through Swiss at 3:50pm was then delayed by an hour, making me miss my connecting flight to Boston and meant I had to spend the night in Switzerland. When I got to the Zurich airport I went to the transfer desk, which when I called, was told that was the place to go for accommodations and  any concerns relating to my issue. The first woman I spoke to was immediately unhelpful, between not allowing me to finish a sentence and walking away from me before I was done talking to speak to her boss and then come back and tell me she could offer me no accommodations (I had never even gotten the chance to explain half of the delays because of her cutting me off) when I finally did she then told me to leave past security and that there was an office out there I could speak to. This is when I started to feel broken down by all this. I told her I don‚Äôt want to go through security, because If truly no one can offer me accommodations I may want to stay in the airport. She tells me she‚Äôs worked here for 25 years and knows what she‚Äôs talking about. Okay then. I walk away from her and find two employees walking through the airport and ask if it was true that there was an office past security that could help me with accommodations. They told me that the only people in this whole airport that could offer accommodations were the people at the desk I was at originally, and that those people would know that and that I should absolutely not go through security. Those employees even gave me a pep talk, seeing how tired I was at this point telling me to be strong and not take no for an answer and speak to everyone I could. I truly had to collect myself and prepare for yet another contentious interaction which is all I‚Äôd been experiencing the past 20 some hours at this point.

I go back to the desk at this point just begging someone to listen to me fully. I explain the situation to a new employee and he immediately recognizes that none of this was my fault and even asks ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt you come here first‚Äù and I responded I did, your colleague told me to practically leave the airport. within minutes he has a hotel and meal vouchers, tram card, my boarding pass. I wish I got his name because this was genuinely the first person in 24 hours who was actually kind to me and acted like they were going to at least do what they could to help. My flight the next day was meant to be at 12pm, and was delayed to 1pm and all I could imagine was having to sleep in the airport that whole time, all because that first woman refused to really listen to me. When I finally got service later I saw that my Swiss app even updated to tell me to go get accommodations at that office! I don‚Äôt know what the problem was that that women was so adamant and dismissive with me . 

I understand things happen but the way we had to constantly fight to be helped in any way in a helpless situation, 4,500 miles from home was so disconcerting and draining. I know to never fly Swiss again. And I truly hope they do the right thing and reimburse my friend, I would appreciate a refund too because this whole situation was beyond ridiculous.",August 2024,"August 31, 2024",1.0,,,,,,,,

It was very bad experience with Swiss air agent called Dolphin and spent too much time in sending e mails forth and back for no action, they did what they want not what the customer wants. No body cares, this delay in delivery and extra charges for the new bag and delivery agent might be on purpose to make you never send future claim to Swiss air.

"Very poor service, avoid if you can",Paris,Singapore,International,"We do not recommend Swiss Airlines. We are a well-travelled family of 5 (3 children)  and  on July 23rd 2024 we were on our way to Singapore (and then Tokyo) via Zurich. Since we had several connecting flights, we had chosen to use carry-on luggage only, and carefully respected their size and weight according to Swiss Airlines policy. We used several air companies during those holidays and never had a single problem... except with Swiss Air: on July 23rd in the evening, when we queuing to board the Zurich-Singapore portion of our trip, an arrogant young man at Zurich airport forced us to check our carry-on baggage, even though they did not exceed the weight and size limits, we had 3 children and it was a connecting 13 hour flight. I explained him we wanted to spare the children the extra-time of waiting checked luggage at the carrousel but he became even more arrogant and even sarcastic. I travel often and have accepted several times to check my hand luggage last minute (even though I still think this should be avoided, it does not happen that often with Asian companies). But for a long-haul flight, there is no reason to pick a family with 3 children to do that effort, and the rude attitude of this responsible of the boarding room in Zurich was clearly inappropriate. We will definitely avoid Swiss Air as from now and have already told our family and friends about our experience. Besides, food was really poor quality.

The worst - you have been warned!!!,San Francisco,Naples,International,"I booked round trip from SFO to Italy.   We needed to change the date of the flight.  Call ‚Äòcustomer service‚Äô.  They said no problem there would be a $50 per ticket change for the date change.

But what they in fact did was book a completely new round trip flight instead of just changing the date.  So now I have TWO round trip flights and am charged for TWO flights no , one for the original date and  another one for the new date.  Thousands of dollars!

I call ‚Äòcustomer service‚Äô and they said ‚Äòyou have two flights, what is the problem?‚Äô, I explained that I just wanted to change the dates and that I was told it would be $50 per ticket to change, but instead I was given a completely new booking.   Customer service says ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt help you sorry‚Äô.  I say ‚ÄòI want to speak to a supervisor‚Äô  Customer service says ‚ÄòThere are no supervisors here‚Äô.   I say ‚Äòhow can I then talk to a supervisor who can help‚Äô.  Customer support ‚Äòyou need call this other number‚Äô.

I call other number, same thing, no supervisor.

I call next day and demand to speak to a supervisor.  They say what is this about.  I explain again, I get put on hold for 20 min.  When they come back they claim that they now understand the mistake and that I will get a refund for original booking as it was only the flight date that was to change.

After 2 weeks I do not have refund.  I call again and this time they say ‚Äòwe do not have a record of a refund to be issued.  What is the refund for?‚Äô   I go back into same explanation.  Customer service says ‚ÄòI understand I will issue refund for the mistake‚Äô

3 days later I get a refund but only for the base flight and not all the seat charges for the flight.  I call back, they  say ‚ÄòOh, sorry, will refund the seat charges.

I still do not have the refund for the seat changed.  I can customer service, they say ‚ÄòI can not help you‚Äô.

Piece of Sh** Airlines. Save your money and go somewhere else!,Zurich,Copenhagen,Europe,"Piece of sh** SWISS airlines. Was supposed to transfer from Zurich to Copenhagen, and SWISS airlines decided to delay 2 times (total 3 hours), and then when passengers were all on board, they kept their passengers on the plane for another 2 hours!!!! Then the pilot made an announcement that due to the clouds, they are cancelling the flight when all the passengers were on board!!! However, because all the ground staff was busy, they kept us on board another 1 hour (total 6 hours delay already).

Then after getting off the flight, they had a 2 hour wait line to the Help Desk. They ran out of hotel vouchers to give out to passengers, and it was already 10 pm! So they told people to get their own hotels and no one got their luggages. People were rebooked to flights 2 days later!! How atrocious of an experience.

Fast forward, 1 month after the flight, their customer service is DECLINING TO PAY for the hotel fee reimbursement. They are claiming that they had to do it for weather reasons, and the weather was only cloudy!! omg.

When we got to the gate, we were the last passengers to board. The staff member at the counter was extremely rude and impolite. We were already stressed because of the delay and unsure if the plane would still be there, and the person checking our tickets made the situation worse.

Despite the fact that we spoke both German and French fluently, this agent chose to address us in English, seemingly because we are Asian. His attitude was clearly unpleasant, and his tone was very aggressive. I am deeply shocked by this experience. If we weren‚Äôt Asian, would we have been treated differently?

Avoid Swiss Air at all cost if you can,Los Angeles,Zurich,International,"We've traveled all around the world on numerous different airlines, but Swiss Air takes the crown for the worst Business Class experience.  

Check in process at LAX was horrible.  The counter personnel were not friendly and it was very obvious they did not care about customer experience what so ever.  Very inefficient process in checking in customers.  We've never waited this long in a business class line ever.

Boarding process was another disaster.  The most inefficient boarding we've ever witnessed.  Of course it's the same crew that checked us in, so go figure.

Plane is delayed 1.5 hours.

Food on board was average.  Possibly the most uncomfortable business class seats we've been on.

Arrive in Zurich and 2 out of our 3 luggage's don't arrive.  Around 30 people in the same predicament.  We are told to file a baggage delay claim on their website and wait until further notice.  Luggage arrives in Zurich 3 days later!  We are in St. Moritz and have to pay for a taxi ride back to Zurich which is 3 hours away to the tune of 690 chf.  

Flight back to LAX.  Flight is delayed again, but this time for 3 hours!  

Same again, extremely inefficient boarding process.  Never seen such a slow boarding process.

Flight crew on board this flight is absolutely the worst I have ever seen.  Not attentive and too busy socializing with each other.  I go to use the restroom and come back to see an extra blanket in front of my seat on the floor.  I ask my wife and she says there was someone's blanket in the aisle and the flight attendant came through and just moved it with her feet to in front of my seat.  For starters how can a flight attendant kick someone's blanket instead of picking it up?  I push the blanket back into the aisle to see how they would address it.  Two flight attendants pass by to go socialize with a passenger behind me and just walk over the blanket in the aisle!  Wow!  They do it again on the way back.  I stop them and asked why they put someone else's blanket in my seat and why would they just walk past it like this.  Their response?  Oh ok, and they just picked it up and left.  No apologies whatsoever!  I stop a second attendant to address the same issue and responds by saying, did you talk to my colleague?  I respond, yes I did and she says ok then.  Do you want some chocolate?  REALLY?

The restrooms?  Wow!  They don't bother cleaning them up during the entire flight!!!  Airlines like Korean Air have flight attendants go inside the restrooms after every customer leaves to tidy things up.  Swiss Air?  They don't bother the entire 12 hour flight!!!  It's absolutely disgusting!

It is very obvious that this was not just a case of a bad flight.  This is a corporate culture where the customer experience is not at the forefront of how they conduct business.  Processes are there for the employees benefit and not the customer.   Needless to say, we will never fly on Swiss Air or it's corporate affiliates like Austria Air or Lufthansa.  When we go back to Switzerland (and we will because it's such a beautiful country), we will go back to flying Air France through Paris like our previous visits.

Avoid this Airline,Zurich,Singapore,International,"I strongly recommend avoiding Swiss Air if you can fly with other Asian airlines. I recently needed a round-trip flight from Singapore to Zurich. To save my company some money, I opted for Swiss Air instead of Singapore Airlines. Unfortunately, this turned out to be a mistake.

My direct return flight from Zurich to Singapore was abruptly canceled at 6 PM on the day of departure, with no explanation provided. I was told to retrieve my luggage and that they would assist me in booking another flight on the same day. I ended up wasting three hours waiting for my luggage, which I never received.

After two rebookings that evening, they finally put me on an indirect flight with Lufthansa the next day around 10 PM. Still, my luggage was nowhere to be found. The only compensation offered was a night's stay at an average hotel (not the Hyatt at the terminal), and by the time I arrived, the restaurant had already closed, so I missed dinner.

Upon returning home, I filed a claim, thinking that EU regulations would protect me in this situation. After waiting a month, I received a nonsensical response citing a ""cargo door problem"" and was offered no compensation.

I understand if cancellations occur due to war or natural disasters, but if your plane has a mechanical issue, it‚Äôs a maintenance failure on the airline's part, and passengers should be compensated accordingly.

I expected much better from SWISS,Zurich,New York City,International,"SWISS struck out on everything for a business class flyer.

1) Prior to being able to board the flight, they required that you stand in an extra line to have someone check that your passport matched your ticket.  What is the purpose of having all of the passengers (economy and business) stand in a common line and then go to their boarding lines?  It would have made more sense for the gate agent to make this check for the special (not economy) boarding lines.

2)  The food was tasteless and cold.  The menu made it seem that we were getting a Michelin star meal.  The only thing with flavor was the raspberry that came with the desert.  

3)  The plane was in poor maintained condition.  The carpet at my seat was not even secured to the floor.  Where is the Swiss pride?

4) The layout of the business class seats must have been done by someone who never had been on a plane. The row in front of me had one seat, while our row had two seats offset to that single seat.  My seat was the only seat in that section that you could not get up with out having the person next to you move.  I thought that every airline with any common sense switched to the staggered business class seating.   I guess SWISS did not get that memo.

Flight cancellation experience,London,Dubai,International,"This was my first time booking with Swiss Air and I was very disappointed with the experience. Both flights were cancelled, due to technical problems. I received an email when I arrived at Heathrow airport, informing me that I have been booked onto an alternative flight to Dubai where I live, with Turkish airlines, which will go via Dubai. This change would mean that I would arrive in Dubai 3 hours later, which was inconvenient, however I was okay with this as I understand these things happen sometimes. However, when I went to check-in for the Turkish airlines flight, I was informed that I am in fact on a standby ticket, as the flight is full, which meant that I would have to wait until check-in is over to see if there is space available on the flight - this meant that in total I was waiting for 5 hours before I could check-in, with the stress of not knowing if I would actually get on the plane. I went to the Swiss Air service desk at Heathrow for help, but the only option they gave me was to book me on a different flight from terminal 5, but it would mean going on 2 different airlines to Dubai which is risky when it comes to delays etc, and would also mean I would have to get a train from terminal 2 to terminal 5, which I would then have to pay for and did not have much time for either, so this was not a good option. I then communicated with an agent online via the Swiss Air live chat, and they said the only other thing they could do was book me onto another flight the following day. So I was left with no choice but to wait and hope for the best. Turkish Air informed me that there was nothing more they can do, they have a full flight - that Swiss air should not have booked me onto this flight without checking if there was space. Fortunately after waiting for 5 hours I did get a space, but I am sure you can imagine it was a very upsetting and stressful experience. If a flight is cancelled, this should not be there rebooking experience - 5 hours of waiting, not able to check in, not sure if when the time comes, there will even be a space available. I could not even eat anything for those 5 hours because I was going between turkish air and swiss air service desk to see what could be done. The rebooking process should be more thorough for customers in future, this was an awful experience. At this point, I do not feel I would like to book with Swiss air in future if this is the customer service.

I have completed a feedback form with a complaint on the website on the 7th August, and have still had no feedback. I followed up on the 9th August via the live chat and the only response I got was that I need to wait for feedback following the form I completed.

Horrendous customer service and a faff to deal with if you want to change your booking.,London,Hong Kong,International,"Had to rebook my flights as I had suddenly received a surgery date close to my trip. I was completely happy with paying some fee for it to be rebooked, but Customer Service told me to send my doctors documents to them and I might get it rebooked for free. Obviously who wouldn't want that? 

After putting my hopes up, the documents team continued to ignore me for 3/4 weeks, I kept getting emails for an ""urgent callback"" even though I've never received a call, and the phone number on this email isn't even a valid number. When calling Customer Service for them to direct me, I'd be met with very fed up people who would blow me off and tell me to wait. I would have no idea what to wait for seeing how to this day I have never received any emails nor phone calls.

After doing what I originally was going to do 4 weeks ago which was just to pay extra costs for a ticket change, costs have obviously increased for the flight prices and the call itself took an hour seeing how after taking my card details a specific customer service member decided to hang up on me before even processing it. I couldn't even get a confirmation email of the request. Customer Service said that it would take 2 hours for the request to go to Ticket office and confirmation would come once they take payment and issue tickets. 

I believe there is a real disconnect within all of Swiss' customer service teams, and have been thoroughly disappointed with the service.

Swiss actually gives you an option to call in for whether you agree to be sent a feedback link after your call finishes, but it never actually sends. Doesn't give me any  confidence that they're interested in improving their service.

After my luggage was lost on a flight, I was assured by a Swiss representative at Miami airport that I would receive a daily allowance based on the contents of my suitcase. However, the compensation I received was much lower than expected, with only 50% reimbursement for essential items like clothing and toiletries.

To make matters worse, the reimbursement amounts calculated by Swiss were incorrect, and despite numerous follow-up emails, I received no satisfactory response. The link provided for compensation was also non-functional, further adding to my frustration.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS (EVEN IF YOUR TICKETS ARE FREE),Dubai,Los Angeles,International,"This is my final email to Swiss Air, which captures their business model.  Bear in mind the flight was never taken due to a medical emergency:

Disappointment with Swiss and Austrian Airlines: A Business Traveler‚Äôs Struggle,Canton of Geneva,Bangkok,International,"Swiss, as well as the group to which it belongs, is deteriorating more and more, especially in the disrespectful way they treat their customers before the flight, even when we travel in business class. In this case, it is a flight with Austrian Airlines but booked through Swiss, so I have to deal with Swiss.

I receive a terse message from Swiss informing me that on the return from Thailand with a stopover in Vienna, the last flight from Vienna to Geneva is canceled. I would therefore have to spend the whole night at Vienna airport and take the flight the next morning.
On their website, we have the choice to either accept or get a refund, with no other alternatives. (I should remind you that the closer we get to departure, the higher the fares; getting a refund means paying more with another airline than if we had booked on the date of our booking with Swiss).
They do not even offer to provide us with a hotel night.
I spend two hours with their online chat. I manage to get them to book the return flight on a Swiss flight, passing through Zurich. I see that the flight appears on my account in the app. I am happy and thank them.
Four days later, I find that the flight from Bangkok to Zurich has disappeared, and there is the flight forcing me to spend the night in Vienna. I understand that the chat agent did not have the right to transfer me from Austrian to Swiss, even though the ticket had already been paid by Swiss.
I write through their form, specifying that the flight via Zurich had been booked during the chat, and that they removed it without even bothering to inform me.

Beware if you think there is a chance you might need to change your flight,Singapore,Nice,International,"I haven't yet flown with them, so can't share that part of my experience, but be very careful if you think there is a chance you will need to change flights on Swiss Air. The way their algorithm works for repricing tickets is really unethical, and the customer experience on that front it awful if you can't self-serve online. This is what I wrote to them in my complaint and waiting for their reply: 

Dear Swiss Airlines,

This is the first time I have flown with Swiss Air and before getting on the flight, I have just gone through the worst flight change experience I have ever experienced. Please see the background below: 

(1) I used your chat system to reschedule my outbound flight to one day earlier. Landing in Nice at the earliest time possible and taking the same class. Given it is a very short trip, I elected to stick with economy. 

(2) The bot offered me a flight that would land after 9am, and would cost around SGD220. I accepted and clicked continue. The bot then redirected me to the website to finalise my confirmation and make payment, to which I immediately agreed. 

(3) Upon landing on the website, I tried to proceed right away. The website then displayed an error and suggested me to contact the system again if the error were to repeat itself. I tried again and the same error was shown. 

(4) I went back to the bot to repeat the entire process. The same flight was offered, but now the price was now SGD440. I was really taken aback by the systems sudden repricing and price hike, and honestly annoyed. It has been a matter of minutes with me following Swiss Air's guidance. If I had come back a few hours later or the next day I would understand, but to witness a price hike like that mid transaction, when I had simply followed the instructions felt to me as both unacceptable and unethical on Swiss Airlines part. 

(5) So I elected to speak to your live chat to explain what had happened and to see if they could resolve this. The individual tried to explain that pricing is not guaranteed, that it can change, and it won't be the same if it isn't the same class. I explained that it was mid-transaction, that the system called an error, and that I had not changed the class of the flight. 

(6) The agent accepted and offered to try to make the change for me on their end. The agent was however unable to offer me the new time I had tried to book, so I accepted a later flight. The price was still however SGD440 now, and the agent couldn't do anything about it. 

(7) To add insult to injury, when I simultaneously went back to the website, I saw that the flight I wanted was still there for SGD440. Given how much time had been wasted, I just went ahead to book it and pay the money. 

(8) I explained to the agent and he/she said they can only see what is on the system, and they also could not see the history of my first chat with the bot (and that it was not necessary). 

I have the flight I want. but this whole experience has left a very bad taste. If the original price I was given was SGD440, maybe I would have felt it was expensive but just have proceeded. It is the fact I felt the SGD220 was reasonable, tried to transact, the system failed and was immediately quoted double that makes it feel terribly unethical. And then after the fact, the fact the agent gave me poor justifications or no justification for the higher rate, was then going to sell me a later flight for the higher fee and couldn't actually help me more made it so much worse. 

I don't blame the agent though, because they can only work with the tools they are given. I am more disappointed with Swiss Airlines. What a horrible customer experience.",July 2024,"July 25, 2024",1.0,,,,,,,,

My one checked bag (that happened to be brand new) was delayed nearly 3 days and then returned to me damaged. The lock no longer works, it was scratched on all sides, and gifts that I had bought were broken and the glass shattered and spilled jam all over the interior and my clothes. 

I have filed numerous online forms and emails with photos, etc. And they still have not resolved the issues. I have only received generic replies --noting first that they do not compensate for minor scratches, but not addressing the fact that the lock no longer works - I cannot take it on future flights - there is no way to secure it. I am getting the run  around. The 2nd email reply only referenced lost ear buds - I did not report lost ear buds. That is not my issue. In short, I am getting the run around.

Disappointing Experience with Stolen Items on Connecting Flight,New Delhi,Nice,International,"I am extremely disappointed with my recent experience traveling with Swiss Airlines on June 29th, 2024. During my connecting flight to Nice, I discovered that several expensive items were stolen from my bag, including Prada sandals, an LV belt, and costume jewelry.

The theft of such valuable possessions has caused significant distress and inconvenience. I trusted Swiss Airlines with my luggage, expecting it to be handled securely. However, this incident has shattered that trust.

I urge Swiss Airlines to thoroughly investigate this matter and take appropriate measures to ensure the security of passengers' belongings in the future. It's crucial that no one else has to go through such a frustrating and disheartening experience.

Until this issue is resolved, I cannot recommend Swiss Airlines to other travelers.",June 2024,"July 19, 2024",1.0,,,,,,,,

Anyone But SWISS -   simply don't care about you - it's as simple as that....,Zurich,Manchester,Europe,"After flying 35k miles in the last 6 months on a number of airlines with great customer service we now experienced the worst .

A joke of an airline with no customer facing staff - when it goes wrong you are on your own !

Due to leave at 5pm, announcement of delay for up to 2 hours whilst sat on plane. After 1 hour Captain said further delay 50 mins ( just to get you under the 2 hour window for comps). 10 minutes later I got a text saying flight cancelled - 2 minutes later the captain announced flight cancelled as they could not land back in Zurich after 11pm - and how the fluck is that my my problem????

A  rep came onboard and advised the same - we asked about hotels and she said they will do nothing, no meals, transport, etc. you are on your own !  Then it dawned on us - there were no hotels available as Taylor Swift was in Town that night - Swiss simply didn't care - not their problem.

So, off to collect our bags and get a text saying rebooked for for 2 days later via Frankfurt and bags checked all way through. What ???? what will we do without our bags? asked at the baggage centre and they said there are no bags as they are in security and will be sent on next flight.

So - no flight, no clothes, no hotel/food etc. and SWISS did nothing to help - no staff around whatsoever - absolute chaos.

We eventually found a hotel miles away at Horgan but the prices had been doubled/trebled due to the aforementioned TS concert - fortunately we had our cards with us so booked and travelled by train.

BUT - no clothes, only t shirt & shorts for 2 nights and days in Zurich, no toiletries no nothing - so had to buy the whole lot and a case to take them back home - just totted up a total spend of 2460 Swiss, about ¬£2122 - which will be submitting a claim to SWISS to pay.

Our replacement flight to Frankfurt 2 days later was also delayed, as was the connection to Manchester - and guess what - our bags were still in Frankfurt. so now 4 days after last seeing them they have arrived in the UK - but now will take until Tuesday to get them to us - that's 6 days in total since we had them - so I rang SWISS - guess what - they simply don't give a fluck - its not their problem.

I argued that we booked, paid for, and even manually selected our seats well before the flight date, and they did not care. They told us the airline overbooks flight IN CASE people don‚Äôt show up!!! SO money hungry!!!! How can they assume people won‚Äôt show up and then inconvenience innocent customers who have done all the right things?!!

We weren‚Äôt late to board the plane, we had our boarding passes and passports ready - we did everything we were meant to and we were still kicked off the flight. They offered us a flight at 7am the next day, and we said no way. They then compromised for 9:30pm flight that night. 

We completely wasted a day in Zurich airport and were given NO explanation as to why we no longer had seats. Apparently there were ‚Äúmultiple factors‚Äù that meant we were on standby. We asked why the people who booked their flight last aren‚Äôt the first to go on standby, and they had no answer.

I will never board a plane again that says Swiss Air,Dublin,Budapest,Europe,"I used Swiss Air to travel home from Dublin, but it was a huge mistake. I booked my tickets about 10 days before the flight, decided to go with one connection via Zurich, it was somewhat cheaper. Well, I will definitely won't do it again.

Got to the airport with my 1,5 old child, went through the security check, all good, then about 15 minutes it, it says 1,5 hr delay (which was our time to get to the connection in Zurich), so the Airline re-booked us, got the text, all good, instead of our 19.15 arrival we will get there at 23.35, but now not with 1 but 2 connections via Zurich and Munich. Which I was still OK with, until we landed in Zurich, and found out that the re-booked connection by the Airline originally, was cancelled. Got another text, our flight has been re-booked AGAIN leaving in the morning (next day), with final arrival time of 12.40 (which again, departure from Munich was delayed with a good 40 minutes, but we were so used to it... lol ) So the total journey was about 20 hours...

We both survived, but the customer service all through the airport was a huge disappointment, the way they handled the whole situation, which turned out been going on in the last 3 days, due to weather conditions apparently... was just very poor, sometimes even unprofessional.

There was no separate lane to help people with small children, and everyone was a dog, one lady basically turned her back at me and my screaming child, because I wanted to ask a question from one of the staff, out of line, to see if there is someone who could help for people like me who is travelling with small humans with zero patience, but the answer was no. Sorry, there was a family room, which we couldn't use, because then I cannot stay in line to get some 'no use' help. The help with accommodation was only a flyer, tells you to book it yourself and then you will get that refunded by the airline.

Delayed Fights and Lost Luggage,Boston,Naples,International,"My family and I had a terrible experience with Swiss Air. It all started when our departure flight from Boston was delayed due to lack of available gates. The delay resulted in a further delay due to weather which caused us to miss our connection in Zurich. We were rebooked on a later flight with a connection to Naples and that flight was cancelled. Swiss Air rebooked us again with Eurowings to Naples thru Germany. We finally arrived in Naples about 9 hours late to find out 2 of 3 bags did not make it. We filed a report and hoped to receive the bags the next day. Both bags had Apple Airtags so we could track their location. My wife's bag sat in Zurich for  4 days and mine went to Frankfurt after sitting in Zurich for 3 days. We spent 5 nights in Naples with no luggage and my wife's bag finally arrived in Naples the day we left for Positano. Naples airport said they would deliver the bag to Positano but they never did. My bag finally arrived in Naples 3 days later never to be delivered to Positano. After spending 11 nights with no luggage we were able to pickup our bags in Naples only to check them for our flight home.

"Extremely bad experience with this airline, recommend that you avoid",Zurich,Canton of Geneva,Domestic,"My fiance√© and I booked a return trip from Dublin to Geneva with a 90 min layover in Zurich each direction. The first flight leaving Dublin was delayed by an hour, which meant we had to literally sprint through Zurich airport to get to the next flight. 

We barely arrived at the next gate in time to find the second flight had already been delayed by 90mins. This delay soon changed on the TV screens to 2 hours and then more than 2 hours. When we asked the staff member at the gate what the reason for the delay was and what the likelihood was of the flight being outright cancelled he had no information to provide and directed us to the flight transfer desk. At this point we noticed that 10+ swiss air flights departing Zurich appeared to have already been cancelled and we became concernedthat ours would be next. Also, our flight arrival time in Geneva was being pushed out from 7pm to almost 10pm, which would leave us stranded in Geneva and unable to reach our hotel in Chamonix that night.

We asked two additional Swiss Air staff members if our flight would be cancelled and they said anything was possible. We then asked if it was possible for us to take a train to Geneva instead as a result of the very massive delay and if the cost of this would be reimbursed by Swiss Air. The Swiss Air staff members said yes, so we went ahead and did this on their recommendation and they gave us information on how to claim the reimbursement.

Both of our return flights to Dublin 5 days later were also significantly delayed, causing us to miss our bus home in Dublin. My carry on bag was also checked under the plane despite being a standard size and there being loads of free overhead lockers on the plane but at that point we were too worn out to disagree.

I honestly would have been able to get over all of this, as sometimes things just suck and you get unlucky, but by far the worst thing has been that Swiss Air is now refusing to reimburse us for the train tickets despite their own staff informing us that they would. We explicitly only took the train based on their recommendation and now they have done a 180 turn, leaving us with the ‚Ç¨200 cost of two train tickets from Zurich to Geneva.

"REALLY BAD AIRLINE, WOULD NOT RECOMMEND",Boston,Porto,International,"I heard great things about Swiss Airlines and was EXTREMELY disappointed in my experience. I arrived at the airport well ahead of my flight and checked in through security. My girlfriend and I got to security and were turned back to the counter because the Swiss employee didn't print our Boston to Zurich boarding passes, we only had the connecting flight in Zurich. I then checked in with the staff member at the gate counter for a seat assignment who informed me the seat scheduler was not there yet and they would call me on the intercom to get a seat assignment. I never got a page and when I returned 20 minutes later after eating the scheduler told me I should have checked in earlier and they did not give me a seat. I paid full price for a ticket and was somehow being treated as a standby passenger. I was traveling with my girlfriend who did have a seat and they told her she would need to fly without me while they rescheduled me which we declined because she did not want to fly to multiple different countries with connecting flights alone. The whole team at the gate was unprofessional and continued to blame us for Swiss Airlines overbooking the flight saying we should have checked in earlier even though we did. They also shamed my girlfriend for not wanting to remain on the Swiss flight by herself. They finally rescheduled both our flights for over 5 hours later with a different airline and had to sit in the airport the whole time. 

They said my girlfriends luggage was already loaded and they couldn't get it off the plane so they sent it to Zurich and it was never transferred over to the Porto flight so she was without all of her belongings for several days forcing us to spend our vacation time shopping for clothes and necessities. Not to mention we were flying to Portugal for a wedding and she was without her wedding dress.

On top of the nightmare that was our trip to Porto with Swiss, the return flight was also delayed over an hour and when we finally landed there was no gate available so we sat in the plane on the runway for 30 minutes to deplane.

Would Not Recommend,Lisbon,San Francisco,International,"It seems fruitless to review an airline as customers really don't have much choice, so customer satisfaction isn't a high priority. However, my recent experience with Swiss made me rethink my stance as I think others should be able to hear about your experience if they seek it out.

Let's start with the primary issue that soured my experience: For the first leg of my flight, I lined up early so was in the first ~ 30% to get on the plane. I know my carry-on was well within the size limit, but the person who scanned my ticket immediately told me it was a full flight so I would need to check in my bag. So I had to scramble to make sure I had what I needed for the next  19 hours of traveling in my personal bag. The gate agent told me that to check the bag in would be ""on them"" as if it was a great favor.

The other gate agent scanning tickets didn't make any of her passengers check in their bags (same sizes as mine) For some mysterious reason I was singled out. I intentionally pack strategically because I never like checking in bags. To get on the plane and see rows and rows of empty overhead space and watch literal dozens of people with larger bags than mine get on after me was incredibly frustrating. In fact, the FA's let people stow their carry-ons under the seat of empty seats!

I had two flights with Swiss, 3 hours and 12 hours (international connecting flights):

-- fairly on time and the flight attendants were nice.
-- For the 3 hour flight, not even free water was offered - I've never encountered that on a non-budget airline. On the 12 hour flight, a lot of food and snacks were available.
- the seats felt really, really small. Unfortunate as this was a full flight. I'm a below average to average size person. The man sitting next to me could barely sit straight.
--The planes are old. Like, really old. The first plane had a bathroom the was juuust wider than me - literally the smallest plane restroom I've ever been in. 
--The seats recline the most I've ever seen on a plane - it felt like the person was almost in my lap. It's so extreme that for meals flight attendants would tell people to put up their seats so people behind them could put down their trays and eat. Very nice of the FA's to do that.

Terrible,Rio Gallegos,London,International,"**Terrible Experience with Swiss Air - Avoid if Possible**

My journey with Swiss was a terrible ordeal, further exacerbated by the length of my travel, though I do not blame them for that aspect. Here‚Äôs a detailed account of my entire journey to provide context to my complaint.

I was travelling from Cordoba, Argentina, to London, UK, returning home. I managed to get my return ticket altered by Lufthansa at a reasonable price, which switched my airline to their Star Alliance partner, Swiss. The flight had one stopover and another changeover, making the journey from Buenos Aires to London quite complicated.

On Friday, 21/6/24, at 20:00, I started an 8-hour overnight coach journey from Cordoba to Buenos Aires. With my limited Spanish, I navigated my way from the coach station to Ezeiza (EZE) Buenos Aires Airport. I arrived at the airport with a 6-7 hour wait to check in. Since I had luggage, I was not flexible in exploring and had limited options for food and hydration.

Eventually, I checked in online and managed to check my main luggage, which allowed me to eat something properly. Security was relatively smooth compared to Heathrow (LHR). However, the flight was slightly delayed. We eventually took off, landing a couple of hours later in S√£o Paulo (GRU). Although this was a stop, we had to disembark, navigate the entire airport, and go through security again to reboard the same plane and seat. By this point, I had been travelling for nearly 20 hours.

Boarding the plane was another drama. The group boarding process, intended to assist those with privileges, vulnerabilities, or seats at the rear, was not followed. The staff at GRU seemed to misunderstand the logistical concept of boarding, leading to congestion and delays. Groups 5 and 6 had no space to queue as airport chairs obstructed the area. The lack of customer care was evident.

Let me explain this in more detail. The priority boarding was completed properly for business class, the vulnerable, and the elderly. However, economy boarding should always be done by boarding the rear passengers first if the front doors are being used. This prevents congestion in the gangway. If passengers seated at the rear of the aircraft board first and place their hand luggage in the overhead bins, it won‚Äôt hinder others from passing. However, if you board passengers in seats 22 and then 44, you can see the issue. Your staff do not seem to understand this concept at all.

After another overnight flight, we arrived in Zurich (ZRH), where I had only one hour to reboard my connection. The pilot reported computer issues with the plane, which were promptly resolved. However, I was concerned about my luggage, and my fears were confirmed when I arrived at Heathrow (LHR) without it. I had to wait another 3-4 hours on Sunday, 23rd, for the next flight to collect my luggage. This extended my travel time significantly. One Heathrow staff member even admitted this is a regular occurrence with your airline.

Overall, my experience with Swiss was extremely disappointing. From the poor boarding process to the mishandling of my luggage, the entire journey was fraught with issues. I hope they take this feedback seriously and make the necessary improvements.",June 2024,"June 27, 2024",1.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,4.0
Just an absolutely awful experience from start to finish. Worst people/crowd management I have ever seen.,Canton of Geneva,Dublin,Europe,"Absolutely terrible management from start to finish.

We boarded our flight about 30 minutes late at 7pm which is fine. Boarding was complete. The entire flight was sat down for about 2 minutes when one of the cabin crew picked up the microphone to do what I assumed was the safety briefing. But no, he announced that the flight was cancelled, due to bad weather. Bad weather happens but it seems completely bizarre and completely infuriating to board everyone then immediately unboard them.

This was just the beginning. We we told to go to the front desk to get alternative solutions booked. I got to the queue for the front desk at about 7:30pm, already 30th in the line. By 8pm there were a further 100 people behind me at least. 

Two people were at the desks to manage this, with each interaction with a customer taking about 10 minutes at least. 

The online assistent on the Swiss Air website was totally hopeless, could not find alternative bookings and would not connect you to an actual person to chat with.

The telephone line to Swiss Air would not connect. I witnessed one woman in discussion to Swiss Air on the phone trying to make alternative arrangements get hung up on by Swiss Air just when she seemingly started to make progress.

After queuing from 7:30pm to 10:00pm, I was a couple of people from the desk. When they suddenly announced that they were closing. This is just hilarious purely from a crowd management perspective because obviously the 100 people behind me were furious as we had all been there for over two hours, standing. At this point people were being told to go downstairs in the airport were there were beds apparently, this was never really clear, and come back to the desk at 4am to attempt to get an alternative. I saw a woman who had a very young child literally be told to wait around until 4am, obviously no food available anywhere in the airport and seemingly no where to sleep, and come back to maybe try and find an alternative arrangement.

We were told that we could be reimbursed 150 Francs for a hotel, in Geneva, 150 francs would barely cover half the cost of any hotel in Geneva at that late notice.

It seemed that no one could make alternative arrangements with Swiss, there were alternative flights available on the swiss air website for the next day and following day that were available to purchase (obviously very expensive at this point), that the Swiss Air people were refusing to rebook people onto. 

I eventually managed to get to the desk, i had found a route to Belfast ran by Swiss Air which I found on the Swiss Air website for the following day. I could book it on their website, but i was told at the desk that I could not be booked onto this route in no uncertain terms, that it was sold out despite me being able to purchase tickets on their website. The earliest alternative flight I was offered was the 1st July, this is 5 days after the flight I was meant to take, which is quite obviously pointless given I needed to be in Ireland over the weekend. I was then told to get a refund and book another flight in the next coming days. Obviously all of these flights now costed at least 500 Fr, many upwards of 1000 Fr, which was at least 3 times the amount I would get refunded.

I left because I was fed up, but people were completely at a loss as to what to do, where to stay, how to claim any money back or get an alternative flight, witnessed people being told by staff aggressively that they didn't know what people should do.

An unfortunate situation, that was made worse by absolutely horrendous people management from start from finish. Not making it clear that the desk would be closing at 10pm, when obviously more than 100 people were told to go to the front desk as we left the plane and then queuing for hours expecting the desk to be open for as long as would be required, being the worst offender.

Also Swiss Air seats are incredibly uncomfortable in general, Ryanair seats are better, to put it into perspective how bad they are. 

Would recommend avoiding Swiss Air as far as possible.

It is completely unfair as well how the Swiss Air employees are treated by Swiss Air. Two people were clearly not tasked to deal with situation and should have had literally anyone available in Swiss to assist at that point. They also didn't seem to have any tools to actually help people find alternatives, unable book alternative flights from other airports, provide information or confidence that we would get money back that we spend on hotels or taxis, and no information in general on how to reach any kind of resolution.

Bad weather happens, this isn't an uncommon occurence so this whole situation is completely inexcusable in my view. Other airlines like Easyjet will very clearly state exactly what you can do when your flight is cancelled and the process is really as simple as it could be. I can't help but think that surely Swiss Air could have just run the flight the next day, especially given we are flying out of Geneva airport. That surely would be cheaper than having to reimburse people for the flights and booking people onto other planes, and obviously would have avoided creating 150 people who will never fly on Swiss Air again.",June 2024,"June 26, 2024",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0

Only 3 hours before leaving for the airport (00:13), we received an email saying that our flight has been cancelled. I opened the chat to see what rebooking options do we have and asked the customer agent to find us a flight which departs same day. At this point, the agent rudely replied: ‚ÄúHow do you think I am going to rebook you if there are no seats available?‚Äù. I replied angrily that he should rebook us same way they let us know about the cancellation only 3 hours before. He simply said that if I don‚Äôt want to add something else, he‚Äôll end the chat. He did not wait for any reply, just ended the chat. I opened another chat and ask the same thing, this time with another agent. This new agent, found was another flight the same day, but we didn‚Äôt take that option because we would have arrived at our final destination only the day after. In the end, they rebooked us onto a flight which departed after 24 hours from Bucharest. I asked if we should do the checkin again, and they said we can‚Äôt, we need to go at the checkin counter. Later that day, I tried to do the check in online and was able to do so, even though there were two different agents who told me otherwise. The next day, our first flight was on time, but the second one, had another delay of 2 hours. All this time, they kept us inside the plane, with not even water provided.

On our return flight, we passed the security gate in Ljubljana and after 10 minutes, we received email that our flight was again delayed. This delay resulted in us missing the connecting flight in Z√ºrich. I opened the chat and asked them to rebook us. The agent rebooked us on a Lufthansa flight to Munich and said we should receive the new tickets in 10 mins. I waited 15 mins and nothing came. Opened another chat and the new agent told us that there is no record of such conversation where we have been rebooked. I told him I have screenshots with the conversation, but you‚Äôre not allowed to upload things to the chat so it was useless. Then, I asked him to book us onto those flights and he did. We went to the security and asked them to let us exit and go to the checkin counter to pick up our boarding passes.

Swiss Airlines employees uses Dolfi1920 to likely steal private property,Los Angeles,London,International,"Swiss Airlines employees or contractors likely uses Dolfi1920 to likely steal private property. At the very least they use them as a scapegoat for severely damaging property, if there employees aren't bag swapping. When Swiss Airlines forced me to check my bag in at the gate because they said the flight was full they then ""lost"" my luggage which is suspicious in that of itself, or just so negligent it seams supicious, which would be even worse. Once ""lost"" my luggage they proceeded to poorly communicate for 3 days the location of the bag while I sat at the hotel all weekend waiting for my luggage. When it was returned, my brand new North Bag looked like it was run over by a monster truck. It was in such bad shape my peers think swiss employees/contractors just swapped the bag, an old one for the brand new one. And I see their argument because it's not believable that Lithuania and Swiss Airlines could have done this much damage to a bag in this short of time. 

I will not be short changed by this massive industry. I will not be taken advantage of by this unfortunate instance and abuse from a corporation from mergers that clearly is too big for customer service rights and has flat out cracks capitalism.

They was saying the aircraft is full & would have too many carry ons, but there was heaps of people with hard back cases who they could of asked to do it instead. It felt like an attack. They just kept saying check it or stay here! & if I responded they just ignored me?! It was the ugliest behaviour I‚Äôve ever seen. I had to get the manager because the bag was not secure to check.

SWISSAIR - Refusal compensation for lost baggage,New York City,Canton of Geneva,International,"Swissair left our baggage and skis at JFK (2 x pax) despite us advising not on plane to 3 separate customer service personnel and then did not arrive in Geneva for 7 days despite constant updates and photos sent to Swissair advising where luggage was (as tracked by airpods).

Upon baggage eventually arriving at Geneva Swissair said will take another 5 days to sort so best we pick up ourselves (ie drive from Chamonix to Geneva return). In meantime we were without skis boots and ski gear - had to hire and buy ski clothes (couldn't rent) and despite careful and non-extravagant spending under mandatory limit per pax, Swissair then refused full compensation (only offered/paid 50%) contrary to Montreal Convention. I had to arrange being driven to Geneva Airport from Chamonix to get bags - had to search airside (amongst 600 other lost bags) to find our baggage and skis - ground crew there very nice and helpful - Later claimed compensation for clothes = approx AUD$2000 and asked for petrol money AUD$100 (rather than charge them another 5 days ski and boot hire = AUD$ 400). They refused petrol money and 50% clothing expense despite our respectful submissions as to their breach of Montreal Convention and contract law. Asked them to escalate. They refused.

Review:

Very disappointed and concerned about the poor service and lack of safety awareness. Many issues encountered on my recent flight with your airline, flight number LX176 on 30th May 2024, from Zurich to Singapore:

1. Lack of Stickers Indicating Fragile Items: This is a basic service provided by most airlines to ensure that delicate items are handled with care. Also, when we sought advice from one of the staff (didn't manage to catch his name) at the check-in counter on how to rectify this issue, he repeatedly insisted, without providing any helpful solutions, that there was no way to indicate that our luggage contained fragile items without offering any helpful solution. 

Moreover, this particular staff was also nonchalant in all his replies to us and didn't bother to tell us that the check-in procedure was done - he merely placed our passports on the countertop and assumed that we knew it was done. 

2. Poor Cleanliness: Upon boarding, I found plastic bottles and other trash left behind on the seat and in the seat pockets. The overhead storage compartments were also full of brown debris of questionable origin (see 1st image). I understand that the staff might have limited time to clean the planes quickly before the next flight. But, if even budget airlines such as Scoot and Jetstar could do it, why couldn't Swiss Air do it as well? This suggests a lack of training and competency from the ground staff. 

3. Lack of Safety Awareness and Initiatives: The most alarming issue. During landing, an overhead storage compartment opened likely due to tremors during touchdown, and luggage almost fell out. My parents were seated below the storage compartment that opened. The cabin crew did not address this potentially dangerous situation. Instead, all of them sat at their seats without any concern. I had to quickly unbuckle my seatbelt, stand up, and close the overhead compartment myself, all in the middle of landing. Additionally, I observed that the crew did not check if the overhead compartments were securely closed before takeoff and landing, which is a critical safety measure. When I raised this concern, one of the cabin crew claimed, ""this happens all the time during landing, all airlines do not do this,"" which is both incorrect and unacceptable. Based on my experience with other airlines, such as Singapore Airlines, Scoot, and Thai Airways, ensuring that the overhead compartments are securely closed has always been part of the safety protocols. Moreover, never in my life have I seen a overhead compartment open up during landing. 

Given this experience, this is the first and last time we will be taking Swiss Air.",May 2024,"June 10, 2024",1.0,,,,,,,,

One Star for Swiss Airlines' Service and Lack of Communication,Denpasar,Amsterdam,International,"I had a long-haul flight from Singapore to Zurich where the sound on my screen wasn't working. I was given the option to sit alone in Economy Plus, but the chair couldn't recline.

Upon arriving in Amsterdam, my luggage was missing. I was informed that it would arrive on the next flight and be delivered to my address. However, it did not arrive that day or the following days. I spent many hours trying to contact them but was always redirected to another office, business, or person.

I filed a complaint and received a response saying they were trying their best. A week later, I received a message stating that the luggage would be sent that day by express from Zurich and delivered as soon as possible. Again, nothing happened.

We travelled to another country the following Monday, forcing me to buy more clothes and necessities. Out of the blue, on Thursday, they delivered the suitcase to the previous address after we had already left for the next country.

Then, the woman at the gate desk started saying that there was not enough space for everyone to put their bags in the cabin, and as soon as we started talking to her, explaining that everyone had bags way bigger than ours, and were entering with no apparent problems, which was true, she cutted us off by saying that it did not matter, and if we continued arguing with her, she wouldn't let us in the airplane.

After that, with no other choice, we entered only with our backpacks, and had to dispatch our other bags. As time goes, we enter the airplane, and walked over to our seats, and on the way there, we saw almost everyone sat down, and space for everyone to fit their bags with no problem.

A sad story with Swiss airlines.,Zurich,Singapore,International,"Me and my girlfriend travelled to Bali for a 3-week holiday and this trip was supposed to be my 40th birthday celebration and proposal to my girlfriend.
We chose to fly with Swiss Airlines as we trusted that travelling with this airlines would make this holiday a very special and pleasant event from the very beginning.
Sadly, this was not the case and both the proposal and birthday celebration got ruined.
Here are the two main reasons:

1. The service on board was terrible.
We paid ‚Ç¨2600 for the flight ticket (for both), and we didn‚Äôt even get the dish served. 
We were told they run out of available choices (2 dishes) and after lengthy, miscomprehended discussion with flight attendant we got lasagna for my girlfriend (which we said we can‚Äôt eat) and leftovers from breakfast for me.
The seat in front of my girlfriend‚Äôs seat was broken and whenever the passenger sitting in front of her tried to lean backwards, it almost fell on her.
The entertainment system in front of me had a broken audio jack and it was not working properly. This means I could not listen to music and watch movies.
3 lavatories went out of order during the flight.
To sum up, this is not what you expect from a ‚Ç¨2600 flight.

2.	My girlfriend‚Äôs luggage was not delivered to Singapore, and it got lost.
After landing in Singapore, we were informed (via e-mail) that her luggage was delayed (for unknown reasons) and that it should be delivered with the next flight. She had all the essential things (clothes, cosmetics, medicine, sunscreens, sunglasses) in the checked luggage and we could not continue to Bali without it. We decided to extend our stay in Singapore by 2 days because we were convinced that the luggage would be delivered soon.
This incurred additional costs to us.
We didn‚Äôt hear back from the Swiss Airlines, nor did we receive any further communication or status on the lost luggage, and we had no other choice but continue to Bali without it.
My girlfriend urgently needed all the essential things and we had to visit the local stores and buy them.
As this was another unexpected cost we only focused on the bare necessities: basic clothing needed for 3 weeks, swimsuits, sunglasses, cosmetics, sunscreens, medicines, new luggage (suitcase).
	
This accident made the whole holiday experience miserable.
It is needless to say that any woman feels comfortable when she has all the things that she needs with her. My girlfriend is no exception and she was not in the right mood to enjoy the holiday, because all her belongings were gone missing.
It was her first time in Asia and instead of enjoying the trip and time off, we had to spend days with stressful shopping and spending the money that we saved for this trip (and not for shopping). Unfortunately, it‚Äôs time consuming, not easy and not cheap to buy essentials a woman needs for 3 weeks.
The proposal to my girlfriend was ruined because her dress got lost and she had nothing to wear for a fine dining dinner. As a result of this, we cancelled the table reservation, and months of proposal planning were wasted.
On top of all these atrocities caused by one lost luggage, my 40th birthday celebration was ruined too, because again, all the stuff needed for the celebration (including gift) was in the lost luggage and we had to spend time trying to solve this unpleasant situation.

After the holidays, we requested compensation from Swiss Airlines for lost luggage. Although the communication with Swiss Airlines was quick, it was unsuccessful (since one is communicating with AI instead of a real person), meaning there was no empathy, just cold, formulaic, pre-programmed responses with a result we were not satisfied with. Swiss offered us compensation in the form of half of all expenses due to the lost luggage. I assume the Montreal Agreement means nothing to this company.",March 2024,"May 22, 2024",1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0

Stay away at all cost!!!!  Horrible airline & service!,Singapore,Amsterdam,International,"I recently had a very disappointing experience with Swiss Air. The in-flight entertainment system was faulty, making the long flight unbearable. The chief offered a voucher and assured me it could be used for inflight shopping. However, when I downloaded the voucher, I realized it was only for flight booking, not for inflight shopping!!!!  Either the chief lied to us or he was unfamiliar with the policy.

The inflight service was poor, with unresponsive and indifferent staff, who didn‚Äôt serve me breakfast service entirely as the stewardess admitted she forgot!  When I pressed the call light, no one came. When I approached the crew to ask why, the chief rudely told me, ""We have 250 passengers and are busy with the service. Don‚Äôt expect anyone to be free to answer the call light!"" Additionally, water was offered only once during the entire 13-hour flight.

To make matters worse, my luggage missed the connection and was delayed for 37 hours. Despite receiving an email stating my luggage would be delivered to my hotel the next day between 2-4 pm, I only received it at 10 pm, causing significant inconvenience.

When I tried to reach out to customer service, there was no response. It felt like they just don't care about their passengers.

2. Check-in at Airport - No large queues at Mum/Zur/Lon; however, check-in personnel at Mumbai was very keen to check-in even our hand luggage and kept repeatedly asking to the point it got annoying. She insisted on seeing our hotel reservations in London which was a first!
3. Flight - Seat pitch is average, and the Mum-Zurich aircraft (same for return) is like an ancient museum piece. Worn seats, 2 of our 4 seats did not have working remotes and very little space in overhead cabins for luggage
4. Meals - Pathetic !! For a 1 am departure and 9 hour flight, you are offered 1 veg/NV roll, Real Active/Tropicana fruit juices (seriously !) and a breakfast (absolute garbage) which has to compete for the worst international airline meal award ! in fact I think kids breakfast was the best and would suggest booking same irrespective of age ! The Zur-Lon leg offered no meals/drinks and had to be purchased. Hello ! A warning this was the case would have helped us plan better !
On our return leg, they ran out of Non-veg, and cabin crew gave some logic of only 12% meals being non-veg on Indian flights. Who cares ! Its not my mistake you have erred in forecasting !

I was so traumatised from the service that i will never ever go with Swiss airways again. Even the name of the airway makes me cringe now, and I want to save others from making a mistake that can ruin your whole travel experience. We booked one of the most expensive flight from Italy (cant remember which airport, but we were in Napali) flying back to Sydney, to avoid any travel issues and we paid more expensive price when we chose Swiss Airways because we thought it'll be better cos Switzerland usually produce quality stuff and the more expensive the flight, the more reliable, etc.. WRONG!!!

The year after covid there was a lot of flight delays and chaos with connecting flights and everything. Swiss airways decided to make changes and delays, which results in us missing our connecting flights. All they had to do was move our flight to another one, which is possible. However, when we called support, this guy with an accent did not want to help us, I dont know how to identify him because he wont give his name either. He basically deny us of changing anything and no refund for anything and leave us stranded in Italy, because when we try to look for another flight online even if we have to pay, it costs at least AUD 5000 - 25,000 one way around that time of the year, no joke! We decided to call again to get another support staff, but our call keeps routing to him and he kept holding us on the line for hours arguing that it's not possible to change our flight, without giving any reason except it is just how it is. We decided to hang up and keep calling in, hoping to get another support staff because he wouldn't transfer us to anyone, not even a manager or anything. Finally my partner used his phone to call support with his phone while we have him on my phone so we got through to a lady who was able to help us immediately and got us to another flight straight away with no issue and no additional costs because they were the one that screwed us over with their changes to begin with.
When I reported this issue to their supervisor about this particular support staff, he just said sorry and he will look into it and he had a tone that just didn't really cared too much and he doesn't seem to realise how that service from 1 person can impact on our whole travel experience. I asked for updates on the investigation result but he never got back to me about this guy. I really want to sue them legally for not giving a f*ck but it's just been too stressful that it was healthier that I let it go. For your own sake, don't book this airway, ever!! If they find it acceptable to have a support staff providing this level of service, I hope they start losing business because that is no way to charge premium cost and provide such horrendous service.

Avoid this airline at all costs - anyone else is better!,London,Canton of Geneva,Europe,"Recently booked a ski trip landing in Geneva. I booked an Economy Light Fare as I anticipated I‚Äôd need to purchase sports baggage to transport my snowboard -  I didn‚Äôt need any other type of luggage. There was no option do this. After reading their policy back in December 2023, I was pleased to find out they transfer sports baggage at no extra cost to your checked luggage. Great! I added on the checked luggage on to my booking and flew out from Heathrow no issues. 

Coming back through Geneva, I was stopped at the check-in desk and was told I hadn‚Äôt paid specifically for my sports baggage and that I‚Äôd need to pay 90CHF to return home. I explained that the policy on the website said that this could be transferred at no extra cost - however upon returning to the website a new policy was in place, stipulating Economy Light Fares could in fact not transfer their luggage at no extra cost.

There was not a single SWISS airline employee in the airport. All were agency staff and all were rude and unhelpful. 

I was told I could not board my flight without paying. I saw my bag left on the runway for 45 minutes and was held to ransom until I paid. I had already paid for 22kg luggage. No payment no flight. 

1. I had no issue at Heathrow airport, and their only response is that they have nothing to do with how airports choose to operate / not operate their policy. 

2. It was a new policy. I researched exhaustively at the time and did not see any Economy Light Fare stipulation. 

3. When I booked, there was no option anywhere to purchase sports baggage anyway. How could I have bought it, if it‚Äôs not even an option on their website? 

4. SWISS have no duty of care to their passengers. All they employ is agency staff who clearly don‚Äôt care about their organisations reputation. 

5. Their customer complaints department is abysmal. 

I‚Äôd implore you, if you‚Äôre travelling on a ski holiday, there are so many other providers that won‚Äôt try to extort you the way SWISS did. A relatively cheap flight quickly became very expensive for me. I‚Äôd recommend EasyJet, BA (or anyone else really).",April 2024,"April 25, 2024",1.0,,,,1.0,1.0,,1.0,

Nightmare Swiss Air flights to and from Delhi,London,New Delhi,International,"The whole experience  has been very disappointing and we will never travel with Swiss Air again . 
We had booked straight  return flights to Delhi going 28/03/2024  returning 15/04/2024.Swiss Air cancelled these flights   and alternative flights were offered : outgoing via  Munich  with Lithansa and return via Zurich with Swiss Air .  We accepted  the changes because we could only fly on these dates.
One member of our group had an Indian passport .On rearranging  our flights Swiss Air failed to inform us that  she needed a transfer visa for Germany on the outgoing flight via Munich . We were only told  on arrival at Heathrow Airport We had to spend a further ¬£500 on a new ticket for her to travel directly to Delhi  with a different airline .We were not the only group affected by this another traveller with an Indian passport on same flight arranged by Swiss Air was told on boarding that she required a transfer visa .As a result she was not allowed on the plane and the plane was delayed while they removed her baggage.Ourselves and 15 other passengers   then nearly missed our Munich connection.

Our return journey from Delhi to Munich on 14/04/2024  via Swiss Air  was even more problematic .
The flight was initially delayed and rerouted  to avoid Iranian airspace.This we can understand  but it was not initially  explained.They did however  tell us the plane was oversubscibed which did not inspire much confidence.
The delay meant  we would miss our connection flight at Zurich ( for which SwissAir had already  been given us boarding passes for) .We realised there was a problem   when we were going through security on recieving an email saying that our connection  flights were to be changed .Racing back to checkin we were given new connection  flights . 15 hours later than previous .We were lucky as we knew about these changes  before we flew from Delhi but so many other passengers had no idea until they landed at Zurich .Their new flights were  24 hours later .
Further expense and inconvenience ensued  as people had to find hotel accomodation whilst waiting for their flight A number of our group had to take forced leave from work

 We were given just  5 swiss franc meal vouchers each for food .

Disappointing Experience with Swiss Airline: Unprofessional Service and Inconvenience,Dubai,Berlin,International,"I recently had a highly disappointing experience with Swiss Airline during my scheduled flight from Dubai to Berlin on April 2, 2024. Despite booking my flight well in advance, with flight numbers LX243 from Dubai to Zurich and LX974 from Zurich to Berlin, I encountered a major issue during check-in. The airline informed me at the last minute that there were no available seats due to overbooking, rendering me unable to check in for my flight as planned.

What made matters worse was the unilateral decision made by Swiss Airline to rebook me on a different flight and airline without my consent or confirmation. This lack of communication and disregard for my preferences was incredibly unprofessional and left me feeling frustrated and powerless. Despite reaching out to their customer service overseas for assistance, I was met with no viable solutions or support, forcing me to accept the unexpected changes to my travel plans.

Furthermore, the airline failed to compensate for their mistake by offering any form of upgrade or additional amenities for the inconvenience caused. I even requested a ticket upgrade considering the significant change in flight details, but this request was denied without any reasonable explanation.

As I prepare for my upcoming flight from Berlin to Dubai tomorrow, I can only hope that Swiss Airline will uphold their commitment to providing satisfactory service and ensure a smooth and hassle-free journey.

Gound staff working for Swiss air at both security and the boarding gate gave us incorrect information about the costs (30 swiss francs) when we accidentally left a device on the plane and were not able to retrieve it since they close the door back to plane immediately after you disembark even if the error is discovered before you get to security. Zurich airport is the worst airport to go through even as an English speaker, the signposting is terrible. Definitely not an airline I plan to give a second chance to get it right. There are better and easier options. Don't bother going into Zurich on a layover, there is nobody to assist you with a complicated ticket purchase for the public transport system. Zurich is designed for Swiss people who are born there and know the system not for foreigners, even English speaking foreigners and they are not afraid to impose harsh fines for genuine mistakes and errors. I think that this brief experience with Swiss airlines and Switzerland were enough to put my family off going back to the country. It's quite an impressive feat.",March 2024,"March 31, 2024",3.0,,,,,,,,

Unethical and deceitful,Oslo,Zurich,Europe,"Swiss airlines sold me 2 business class tickets

On the booking confirmation Swiss airlines noted that the carrier was Scandinavian Airlines and provided details on the seating arrangements which included the words ‚Äúempty middle seat included‚Äô. There was no requirement for me to reserve a seat to ensure the empty middle seat is included in the reservation.

However the middle seat was not empty as I sat in it and had people seated on either side of me. This was also true for my business class travel partner.

I claimed compensation from Swiss Airlines as they deliberately sold me a product that they knew would not be delivered. I know this because in correspondence to me after the flight the Swiss representative stated ‚Äúthat SWISS has no control over the type of service or cabin that our partner airline offers.‚Äù

This is a contradiction to the details on my booking. It is clear therefore that Swiss Airlines knowingly sold me a product it knew it was unable to unable to deliver.

Swiss airlines has refused my request for compensation and claims it is not responsible for deceptively selling me a service that it knew would not be delivered.

Never Again,Zurich,Los Angeles,International,"I had originally heard good things about Swiss Air from a friend, but after flying with them twice (connecting flights), I disagree. I flew Swiss Air going from Norway to Los Angeles in March. The day we flew out of the Oslo airport it shut down due to a snowstorm so our flight was delayed 8 hours, which the airline had no control over. However, once we were able to board again, the only consolidation prize we got was free coffee or tea, but we still had to pay for all other snacks and services‚Ä¶and  I‚Äôm pretty sure the coffee/tea was already free to start with. Like really, that‚Äôs the best you can do? Anyways, once we got to Zurich, we had to rebook a connecting flight back home to LA  due to the 8 hour delay. The flight from Zurich to LA was roughly 12 hours and was probably the worst flight of my life. At the boarding gate, they made us get special stamps on our boarding passes and if we didn‚Äôt have them then we couldn‚Äôt board. There was a bunch of confusion as to where to get the stamps and long lines started forming around the boarding area. It delayed our flight leaving by roughly 30 minutes. Once my family and I finally got up to board, they grabbed our bags and told us we had to check them. We were row 30 (only 3 rows behind business class) so it‚Äôs not like we were the last to board or like we were in the very back of the plane. After they took our bags I pleaded to keep them, and if we couldn‚Äôt find room for them overhead then we‚Äôd bring them back and they could be checked. I stressed how this would cause a big inconvenience to us because once we landed we still had a two hour drive home and baggage claim in LA can take an hour or more since it‚Äôs a busy airport. They didn‚Äôt seem to care and continued to tell us it was a full flight and they wouldn‚Äôt fit. The thing that really pissed me off was that they let people boarding after us walk on with their luggage AND once the boarding process was complete there were 4 completely empty overhead bins over our seats. I was livid. Then once we got in the aircraft it was like a swamp, it was uncomfortably warm, humid and smelled like sweat and feet. The Boeing 777-300 plane we were on didn‚Äôt have any overhead fans. I told the flight attendant I was feeling warm (I have a condition where my body overheats very easily and can make me feel nausea and faint) and she told me that air only circulates when the plane is in motion so I had to sit uncomfortably for 30-45 minutes before they turned on the air. Even after it was turned on during the flight, it felt very inconsistent, and would switch between hot and cold throughout the whole flight. I would also like to add that their economy seats are much smaller than an average plane. I fly internationally roughly 5 times a year, and I‚Äôve taken multiple airlines throughout my life and almost always fly economy. I could barely eat the meal they provided us because my elbows would be touching the people next to me when cutting up my food (I was in the middle seat). It was incredibly frustrating, I felt like I was boxed in. Their trash service was also inconsistent, and after every meal service, our trash was was left on our table for roughly 45 minutes to an hour. I counted and trash service only came by four times on a 12 hour flight. There were two times when I had to get up and throw away my own trash, because I wanted to use my tray table but couldn‚Äôt. Towards the end of the flight, I was so frustrated that I literally started crying an hour before we landed because I just wanted to get off that plane so badly. I‚Äôve truly never been so uncomfortable in my life.",March 2024,"March 22, 2024",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0

We sat in row 44 (for both our flight to Johannesburg and back to Munich) and both times we were uncomfortably hot - so I‚Äôm not sure if that specific row is just away from the cool air, but it was almost unbearable. 

I have flown other airlines and in Economy I had WAY more space. We were squashed like sardines. My toddler was even uncomfortable with how little space she had. Completely unable to get even a few hours of rest on both flights due to the heat and the lack of any space.

Not acceptable for this price!,Zurich,Bangkok,International,"Let me be clear and precise right from the beginning: Swiss International Airlines ‚Äì you could do it better. Right from the beginning I knew, that I would pay too much money for an old product and I really got what I deserved. For my flight from Zuerich to Bangkok and Bangkok to Zuerich, I booked Business just to be sure I have some comfort on this long journey. It was the very first time I took decision to go for Swiss Business since my friends told me long time ago it is not worth and I always choose other products. However, this time I tried it and of course got disappointed. It already starts with WYSIWYG ‚Äì Swiss is advertising they flatbed with the help of a photo on their homepage. You get the impression of a nice mattress offered for your bed including a nice duvet. Reality: it is a poor standard blanket and a pillow, but no mattress. So why advertising it wrong (see my pictures below ‚Äì fake). Swiss always tries to explain their seats are comfortable equipped with air-pillows, but fact it is, you do not feel and you still have some holes between the seats sections once flat. On top, it is not very cozy to sleep on a bed without something between you and the surface where hundreds of other people sat before. Paying 4500 Swiss Francs for these two flights is unacceptable with this quality. Let me come to the next disappointment. Of course, since it was a flight to Bangkok, the obligatory Asian Crew was onboard. We got asked for dinner and breakfast: in English. I fly Swiss, and I have to correspond in English ‚Äì well done, great job! Asking for a bunch of money, hiring cheap staff and let your customers adopt to the habit of the company ‚Äì unbelievable. However, it is no problem for us, but I am sure many Swiss people go for this Airline just to be comfortable and able to speak in their native language. We got asked to confirm our pre-selected dinner, which was onboard and later nicely cooked to perfection ‚Äì no complains at all, well done. For breakfast, we had to do a choice out of many components, which is slightly complicate and confusing for the staff. They had to do many unnecessary ups and down in the aisle just to bring these different breakfast choices to the people which was so time consuming that they were unable to ask you for another coffee or slice of bread. Breakfast can be done easier, also in Business Class. However, who likes it ‚Äì he/she will get it. For the boarding, we got cold nuts ‚Äì directly from the fridge ‚Äì Swiss, you have to learn a lot from other airlines, especially the Near Eastern one. As already mentioned, the dinner was excellent, but also there, room for improvement. Instead of serving all at once except main course and dessert, why not one by the other, why putting cheese on the starter, why not asking after. The amenity kit was nice, but also there ‚Äì why not offering slippers like it is done in other business class products? Instead you got the cheap economy socks, tooth paste and brush, nothing else. Etihad offers a Bulgari Set of Lotion and perfume. In general, the staff was attentive and helpful, toilets always clean. However, as mentioned, there is much room for improvement (also the Swiss Lounge in Zuerich does not offer much dishes compared to the Thai Royal Orchid for example.

No fuss operation......,Dublin,Zurich,Europe,"We enjoyed a more-than-serviceable intra-Europe business class flight experience with Swiss, flying from Dublin to Ljubljana via Zurich. The Airbus A220s with a 3+2 configuration were new and sparkling clean. The check in experience in Dublin was superb and actually having the Swiss rep say thank you for your business almost had me falling over in shock (as we know Swiss are part of the Lufthansa group). She was a delight and joined us on the flight. The lounge in Terminal 1 at Dublin was excellent - and conveniently named ‚ÄòThe Lounge‚Äô - great breakfast offerings and a bar and barista in the left hand half of the lounge.  The flight from Dublin left slightly late due to inbound traffic restrictions in Zurich - but we made up time. The in flight service and meal offering was fine - if you like your nitrates and fancy a souvenir cutting board - go for the cold cuts. We arrived into Zurich, cleared immigration and headed to the Swiss business lounge - it was hideously overcrowded and positively colonial in the savagery as any available real estate was snapped up. The person on the desk tried to send us next door to presumably the First lounge for a bit more space‚Ä¶ but something was wrong with the number on our boarding pass and ‚Äòcomputer said no‚Äô. This was a miles redemption so that might have been it. By the time we fought our way to the food/drinks and back downstairs to a tiny corner on a sofa, it was time to Go to Gate. When we arrived they were boarding Economy. We walked to the other side of the check in desk where there was a sign for premium and business and a woman started ordering me, repeatedly, to join the queue. She didn‚Äôt even look at the boarding pass and when I insisted she did she couldn‚Äôt bring herself to actually be nice but snapped that Business had already been called. Last time I checked, in the civilised world (apparently not a Swiss Flight in Zurich), boarding early and/or with priority is not an obligation on my part.

Again, she wouldn't check me in without a new carrier.  So I carried my dog in his perfectly fine carrier, because she'd told me dogs weren't allowed on leashes, to buy a new one.  All this, without one smile, one apology for the inconvenience, anything remotely nice or personable.  She spoke over me whenever I tried to respond or explain.

Swiss air damaged suitcase,Cleveland,Canton of Geneva,International,"My suitcase was delivered  broken 3 days after my arrival in switzerland. After sumbitting multiple complaint forms and emails I was directed to a third party that deemed the suitcase irreperable. And they offered me a gift voucher for 1/3 of the value of my suitcase but it has to be used at their store, so I have to spend over 100.- for a new suitcase, only with their store.  
I am unhappy with this proposition and Swissair does not seem to have a support number to handle this matter directly.

TERRIBLE AIRLINE! NEVERBOOK HERE IF YOU DONT WANT TO GET SCAMMED. RIDE CUSTOMER SERVICE!,Los Angeles,Zurich,International,"I booked a flight and paid $376 for specific seats but realized shortly after that I had chosen the wrong ones and contacted their customer service within 3 hours of booking to request a seat change. Anne, the representative, assured me that the modification could be made without extra charges. After modification, we requested for a confirmation number for the seat change just to make sure but Anne insisted we would receive it via email.

She also informed me that I had the option to cancel the flight without penalty within 24 hours of booking, this policy applies for all non refundable tickets. We were looking into this option if we were told that the seats can‚Äôt be modified or if we will need to pay extra charges for the modification. 

However, after waiting 2 days, I have still not received any confirmation. When I called back to get an update I was told that there were no modifications made and I now need to pay an additional $180 to change my seats.

Had I been informed correctly during my initial call, I could have simply cancelled the flight to avoid unnecessary charges, while i still can without penalty.

There were even still completely empty rows, but if we wanted to change both of our seats to one of these empty rows Swiss wanted us to pay to times the amount.
We payed for a regular tickets, no special offer or anything alike. It just looks like a scam from Swiss to place couples apart and let them pay for additional fees if they want to sit next to each other.

Not great,Johannesburg,Birmingham,International,"I've been flying to and from the UK to Johannesburg for 9 years. First time on Swiss Air and probably last.

We had 2 seats to the rear of the plane. My food tray was broken and I had to hold food and drink down, otherwise I would have had it all over my lap.

Passengers had brought enormous hand-luggage, suitcases as big as normal checked in baggage. This caused chaos, with everyone trying to shove their bags in the overhead. Space ran out and there was so much faffing I thought we would never take off.

We were near the rear and food ran out, leaving us with a vegetarian biryani option. I thought this was a choice, not something you are left with as the airline didn't plan properly? Air steward seemed very put out when I didn't seem impressed.

Food was otherwise a stale roll and breakfast a stale croissant with watery yoghurt. 

Cabin staff seemed miserable and not happy to be working. This was a great atmosphere for 10 hours.

To top it off, after a 10 hour flight, the transfer from Zurich to Birmingham was a joke. We had literally 20 minutes to run through the airport. This meant our luggage was not loaded. Could have been worse, a lady on our flight has no luggage and has an onward flight. Have no idea when the luggage is expected. If the airline cannot sort bags in time, then don't offer the transfer??

"Nightmare flight, stay away.",Ottawa,Rome,International,"While the flight itself was comfortable I will never fly with them again. Firstly my departing and return flights were canceled from Ottawa to Montreal and from Montreal to Ottawa. I was told to request a refund after the trip has been completed. They were not able to give me a refund amount. After calling 3 different numbers 7 times, and getting the run around. Being told to fill out online forms, not hearing back, and being told the form will not work in my case by one agent, and then being told to fill out the refund form again by another agent I have gotten nowhere. Every time I ask to escalate the case to a supervisor or manager I get hung up on (I am frustrated but calm and understand it is not the agents fault). I eventually got $70 refunded - for 2 cancelled flights for 2 people (this does not even cover the bus fair we needed to pay because of the cancelled flights). I spent over 4 hours on the phone talking to different agents being told different things. Now I am trying to confirm that if I am seriously only entitled to $70 for 2 cancelled flights for 2 passengers and they cannot give me any answers, only tell me to fill out the online form for a 3rd time and wait another couple months (I filled these out in October and again in December 2023).

This is all without mentioning that we had missed a connection as we were given 50 minutes to transfer in Zurich, there was a medical emergency on our plane, long customs lines, and needed to transfer via train to a different terminal. When I spoke with the agent he tried to blame this on us saying it was our fault we missed the connection and said we would have to pay for another flight. Eventually when I pointed out that many of our fellow passengers from the same flight were in the same boat as us, he relented and booked us on another flight free of charge (although quite rude about it). This delayed the start of our honeymoon vacation by over 6 hours and we missed a booking for a museum we had made. We have been told we are not eligible for any compensation for this. 

This was the most stressful flight I have ever taken, cancelling legs and missing connections due to things out of our control. The customer service has been terrible and they have done nothing to right this situation despite my best efforts contacting them multiple times spending much of my free time ($70 is an insult after what they put me though).

Good experience overall,Zurich,Dubai,International,"We were a large group of 13 and were heading to Dubai coming from Manchester and were connecting from Zurich. 

Expectations were relative compared to what we paid and we were very surprised. The service and food was good and the plane was comfortable. 

This review would have been 5 stars if it wasnt for 2 members of staff who let the team down. 

The air hostess who was cleaning after snacks and meals seemed miserable, unfriendly and even angry. If she doesn‚Äôt like this aspect of her role ask to change it or find another job- no need to make me feel guilty for you having to collect the rubbish. I would happily clean my own but we are on a plane and that‚Äôs how it works. 

The second member of staff really IRRITATED me. It wasn‚Äôt  just him but his behaviour was more cringe. He constantly attended to this female who by the sounds of it had left a positive review from Canada I believe. Swiss air give commentary movenpick ice cream and chocolate (a great gesture and the best tasting) but as he gave me and my son one each-he gave this woman ariund 15 chocolates and these generous gestures were on  frequent occasions-just seemed unfair to everyone else. This passenger was even given champagne and regular drinks of her choice and sat right in front of me-it was a awkward feeling. This male host was a jackle and hide character as he would be so friendly to this lady and then within a second be very formal with us. He wasn‚Äôt rude and did his job-just got lost in the moment and didn‚Äôt appreciate how his kindness and fondness of a particular guest may have been perceived as unfair to the rest of us. I wasn‚Äôt even bothered about the chocolates (I lie I was they were nice) or the champagne as I do not drink, it was about having the awareness on how you look infront of other guests and portraying an element of favouritism, this can wrongly lead to presumptious conclusions, why is this person being treated differently: eg male host female guest, ethnicity etc and ultimately damage the company if not learnt from.

Harrowing experience Swiss Airline Ground Staff on Feb 13th at Mumbai between 9:40 PM to 12:05 AM at Gate F,Mumbai,Dublin,International,"Had a harrowing experience with a Swiss airline ground staff at Mumbai airport while checking in 
I was traveling as a student to Dublin for the first time and she expected me to reduce weight in my laptop bag
I couldn't even pour contents from laptop bag into check in bag as laptop bag has laptops chargers and earphones and electronic devices which were required to carry.. Also it included college documents that were important to carry as a student.. she kept on insisting to reduce the weight while I constantly asked her to tell me what as a student is not important and I can skip carrying to which she had no answer. She was at the F gate in Mumbai airport T2 at Lufthansa belt.. she then asked me to compensate and add my cabin bag to the check in which I was against doing as it had a backup winter clothes which I would require incase my baggage is delayed.. I asked her to give me in writing that my bags wont be delayed and I'm ready to add all 3 bags for check in luggage but she said that isn't possible
Instead she started saying that the bag is heavy if it falls on someone's head due to turbulence who will be responsible? In reply to which I told her PPL will buy extra stuff at duty free and obv they can't return to chk in counter to check them in.. in that case what is the guarantee that a duty free bottle won't fall on someone n break his head.. to which she had no answer.. basically by creating panic she only wanted to extract funds worth 12 kg for an extra 3 kg weight in laptop n cabin bag.. I had my boarding at 12:50 AM n I reached the check in counter at 9:40 PM.. from 9:40 PM to 12:05 AM which is almost 3 hours she refused to hand me my boarding pass and I was yet to go thru security check and immigration.. I vacated most contents of my check in bags which as a student I thought it would ease my life in the beginning days.. I hope she heals soon must be a really sick person in her head to do that.. her senior manager came to my rescue and rushed me to the boarding gate ASAP and apologized on her behalf.. but being the person she was, even at boarding gate she rushed to the scanner while it was my turn to enter and said she would want to weigh my cabin n laptop bag and then her senior manager again came in and intervened and told her it's been dealt with n she doesn't need to be dealing with this anymore.. so yeah Swiss Airlines is amazing in terms of food, service, IFE etc.. but sure they can have better ground staff who know their job needs to make sense..",February 2024,"February 14, 2024",4.0,,,,,,,,
"Worst airline ever, Ryanair goes long haul",Amsterdam,Singapore,International,"Worst airline I have ever flown with! As a 198cm guy (6'6) I always try to get extra leg space on short haul flights as I want fit between the chairs otherwise. This is normally provided. However on this 13 hour flight back from singapore I had to squeeze in these very small chairs with absolutely no more leg space then the worst budget low cost short haul planes. It feit like being on a Ryan air plane for 13 hours, i didnt even know this was allowed. I have had multiple long haul flight before (KLM, turkish airlines, qatar airways, Emirates and even surinam airways) but this was by far the worst experience. When I asked to get reseated they said they were fully booked which was clearly not the case. 

On the flight there it started off with a delay on Schiphol due to understaffing. We arrived late on Z√ºrich airport and it was not clear whether we would make the connection so we had to run like crazy through the airport only to find out they were nice and relaxed waiting for everybody to then start clearing the airplane of snowfall. Why not already start so we could depart still on time? The captain tried to make up for lost time but when we arrived we had to stay in the air for over an hour so we missed our connecting flight to penang. We had to stay overnight in singapore as the airlines that flew that same evening did not have a contract with Swiss airlines.

DREADFUL !!,Singapore,Zurich,International,"A dreadful airline!! 

Unavoidable electrical delay in  Singapore Changi resulting in many passengers missing their onward connecting flights. in Zurich. For me, the Manchester flight, resulting in a  9 HOUR layover in Zurich airport.
Eventual boarding call to gate D. One of the 4 check in agents was stamping boarding passes with a purple stamp.
Long queue for 'purple' boarding passes to go through the 'purple' machine so frustrated passengers began to queue at the 2 non-purple check in agents who for some reason could not cope with this.
Once checked in passengers were sent up an escalator to board the plane.
Halfway up the escalator I realized that the passenger jam at the top was blocking my exit. I crashed into this people jam and fell on the floor as other folk were coming up the escalator and started to fall, luckily not on me; potentially a dangerous situation. Luckily someone hit the red 'escalator emergency stop' button and we all managed to get up, shaken and shocked.
It seems that the flight attendants were staggering embarkation of passengers onto the plane causing the jam further back.
The ground staff should be trained to anticipate and deal with this situation.

During the 12 HOUR flight my Premium Economy seat would not recline and the promised return to fix it by a flight attendant did not happen. So I sat upright for the entire flight.

The tv screen of every seat remained glaringly bright when the plane was not 'sleeping' and could not be adjusted.

The flight attendants seemed to have a problem with special meal requests. At one point two attendants were debating a problem OVER and on either side the middle 4 seats and then passed a tray OVER these 4 seats. Very unprofessional.

I've had similar experiences with Business Class Lufthanza,  Swiss Air's sister company, earlier in the year. I have only been offered a Swiss Air voucher as compensation. These are useless to me as I shall never, ever, fly with either of these two airlines again. They are just awful.

My worst long haul flight experience,Johannesburg,Barcelona,International,"What can I say? It was a rather terrible experience. I will start of by saying that our flight to Zurich and back from Zurich to Johannesburg was probably the most uncomfortable plane I have ever been on for a long haul flight. The planes are old and outdated, little leg room, with a very limited entertainment line up.

Food....oh wow! we were towards the back of the plane and we had only a choice of vegetarian. From about 8 seats in front of us it was only vegetarian left. No meat / chicken options anymore. According to the website when booking your flight ""vegetarian"" is something that has to be pre-ordered. Why on earth would the last 8 rows on the plane only have an option for this......this was not the worst, with this we received a nice and stale bread bun....
 
it does not end here, breakfast has no selection, you eat what you are given....oh and guess what, once again a stale bread roll and a stale croissant which has turned hard all around the corners.

On the way back, once again no meat option left, oh and guess what another stale bread bun. 

The rush between the transfer is so bad, we actually had to run from one terminal to another. My bag did not even make the flight from Zurich to Barcelona. Lucky me we had to dock up another 80euros to and from the airport to collect my bag. 

I have done numerous long haul flights on Singapore Airlines, Cathay, Qatar and Qantas and have never been this disappointed.

Terrible Experience pathetic service don't even deserve a one star disgusting!!!,Bloemfontein,Manchester,International,"I purchased a flexible ticket directly from SwissAir website. There was a need to delay my return flight as I had an unfortunate serious accident whilst on holiday which left me with serious injuries! The start of my bad experience with Swiss Airlines was trying to change my return flight dates on this flexible ticket! For weeks on end struggling with their pathetic website not working! When calling in to their call centres is always an excuse claiming the website to be under maintenance and trying to deal with your call centre agents was absolutely atrocious and a level of unbelievable frustration!! They are just not interested and simply unhelpful! One agent sends me to another in circles and the attitude just shows a lack of interest!!! Eventually I found an agent who helped with my ticket change but which eventually has cost me a hefty phone bill calling International numbers over and over again! One of the phone calls I asked for wheelchair assistance specifically on my flight between Zurich and Manchester with the reason being the layover was short only 45 minutes and with my injuries I would not have the ability capacity or energy to get to the next terminal fast enough on my own so I asked please have wheelchair assistance ready for me on this stop over! Now this is where my experience with Swiss air becomes absolutely disgusting!! so we land in Zurich and before disembarking I asked two air hostesses who seemed more interested in there conversation with each other than paying attention to my question ‚Äúis my assistance waiting for me‚Äù instead I get this look from them ‚Äúlike what's wrong with you‚Äú and get told to go wait in the passage on exiting the plane!
So on exiting the plane there was a gentleman waiting with a wheelchair but claimed it was for someone else! I inquired from him where my assistance was. He looked at what seemed like a handheld device and said ‚Äúyes it shows your name and that you requested assistance‚Äù and told me to wait further down the passage from the plane someone was on their way and this is what I did! For 20 minutes I waited, left completely abandoned and alone, not one person in sight! No one arrived with help! Because I was running out of time I forced myself to try to move fast enough to the next terminal on my own struggling in pain! When I got to security desperate, your idiot security personal didn't even blink an eye to try to help! In fact, the pathetic fool checking my bag actually pretended not to understand English!! Luckily I just made the next flight with an extreme physical struggle!!! Then to top it all off my luggage was lost and I had to go through an extra inconvenience getting it back late the next day which left me running out of important medication!!!!

"The most uncomfortable flight of my life, phone jack inoperable",London,San Francisco,International,"This was a Boeing 777, which I've flown on before, although never in the middle aisle. I had an aisle seat (fortunately!) in the middle section given that no window or side aisle seats were available. 
I'm wondering if the already miserably cramped economy seats have been even further downsized on the middle aisle rows. The average-sized adult male stranger seated next to me had to turn sideways in my my direction to get his knees into the seat, and spent the entire 11 hour flight with one foot in the under-seat compartment in front of me that was supposed to be holding MY baggage, but he had no choice. He literally would not have fit in the seat otherwise. When the row in front reclined their seats the television screen was literally six inches from my face. The tray table was unusually short and sat at an angle so that what little could be fit upon it invariably slid off. 
I plugged my phone in, and tried to go to sleep. 3/4 of the way through the flight I checked my phone for the time and noticed everything was red-- it was on low power mode. The phone jack did not work. 
I went back to speak to the steward, explaining that I absolutely must have my phone available to contact my ride upon arriving in the airport. Was there anywhere else to plug in a phone? Nope. I asked if there were any empty seats where I might try the phone jack to see if it worked. There was only one on the plane. The steward accompanied me to it, and we found that multiple other customers were taking turns jacking their phones on it since so many of the plane's phone jacks did not work.

So, I landed alone in a foreign country with a completely dead phone.

The 2 hour flight I had to take to connect to my transatlantic leg was farcical. No complimentary services offered whatsoever, a literal tea bag to be dunked into a cup of hot water cost about 4 euros. No thanks. 

Boarding was ridiculous, on both legs of my flight. There is not even close to enough overhead storage on the plane, so customers were constantly turning around and heading back to the front to gate-check bags or look for a place to put their bags against a sea of boarding customers trying to reach their seats. It was a zoo.

Air flight continues to amaze me when I really thought it could not get any worse.

Horrow movie flight!,Boston,Zurich,International,"Of the hundreds of international long-distance flights I have taken, the worst in every way was the Swiss Air Boston-Zurich flight I took this month. I will never fly again with this airline whose sole purpose is to fraudulently take more money from its customers and offer less comfort.

The problems started when this company, which sold tickets with the promise of 1 suitcase allowance, demanded additional money at the airport. The economy class location on my ticket was changed to economy light at the airport.

At the Boston airport, an extremely rude officer demanded money in a very rude manner. When I showed him the ticket, he said it was not reflected in their system and closed the issue. We had to pay  total of $300.

The plane seats we got on were made for children. In order to accommodate more passengers, we traveled in seats that could not accommodate an adult. The seats were hard as stone. The pitiless, ignorant passenger in front reclined his seat throughout the journey, including meal time. When I asked for help from the stewardesses, I encountered the same rudeness and rudeness. Whereas it was a common rule for other airways to turning of seats to normal position during meal times. 

It was not possible to eat or drink anything. Although the food given did not look like it could be eaten. I returned it as is. In the end, my 9-hour journey was a torment. When I got off the plane, I thanked God and said never to swissair again.

My advice to you is to be very careful and take any negativity into account if you have to fly with this airline. Disgraceful food served and staff behavior including seat sizes.",December 2023,"January 28, 2024",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
Fly another airline,Los Angeles,Canton of Geneva,International,"I booked directly through Swiss Air. I paid for extra legroom and a seat assignment. I paid for extra baggage. I got the app, which is a complete joke. I get to LAX and then was told that I didn‚Äôt pay for extra baggage. I thankfully had my receipt that showed I did. I then had to pay an extra $285 for my snowboard bag. This is why I paid for the extra baggage. No where on their website can you pay for sports equipment. Then we board the plane, and on the plane it say that on Swiss Air ski and snowboard bags are free. I took a screenshot of this. Then on our return I showed the ticket agent this and he said because I had economy lite that wasn‚Äôt included. No where on the screen was this stated and no where on the website is either. Nothing about sports baggage. I showed that I paid for extra baggage again on my receipt. They said we don‚Äôt show it here and charged us $322 Swiss francs. I also checked on another bag. When we arrived, the regular bag had a wheel ripped off. We went to the baggage center at the airport and filled out a damage report. They said that we can get a new bag on this website using the damage file report number. Guess what. It doesn‚Äôt work. After being told to call three different numbers, the only way I can have this resolved is if I call Switzerland from America. The phone call is going to cost more then the bag. 

We also paid to upgrade to business class. None of my extra leg room or economy seat assignments were refunded. Again the only way is to call an international number. I did try to fill out the online refund form but there hasn‚Äôt been any action or response. 

Fly another airline and/or get ready to be charged an arm and a leg everywhere you turn. It‚Äôs like a mob airliner. Literally all the Swiss Air employees say, there‚Äôs nothing I can do.

"Sadly, our last flight",London,Zurich,Europe,"We could have written sergeantyork's review posted here yesterday.  I believe we were probably fellow passengers.  I would like to add my experience also.  We have travelled with Swiss air on this route several times the last trip being in 2020.  We couldn't fault the service back then but the experience we received this time bares no resemblance.

The boarding of flights is shambolic.  Both flights were delayed because they just seem incapable to getting people on and off in a timely manner.  Even our 6am flight out of Heathrow was delayed purely because they couldn't get us boarded in time! 
Our return trip arrived one hour late and my bag didn't appear on the carousel.   There were about 8 of us I believe missing luggage.  First we were told that the bags were stuck on the plane and they were working out how to get them off and then told some time later that they had been left behind in Zurich but would hopefully be coming in on the next flight.  We were staying in a Airport Hotel nearby rather than travelling home so I really needed my belongings that night.  The next flight came in - nothing.  I thought I'd ring Swiss customer services for assistance to explain the situation and to ask them if they could tell me if my bag was definitely checked onto a flight that night as we couldn't face spending all evening in the baggage lounge for nothing.  I got through quickly to a lady who said she could not help my and only option was to send an email from the Swiss website for advice.  I asked her how it would take for someone to reply to be told within 7 working days!  That's Swiss' customer services for you.

I am very pleased to report that my luggage did eventually arrive just after 8pm in the evening but there was no communication from Swiss whatsoever nor did they update the staff at Heathrow.  I can accept that things do sometimes go wrong but the lack of communication was dreadful.

Would we travel with Swiss again - no.  We were surprised at how much hand luggage was being taken onto the plane and this was definitely contributing to the problem of getting people on and off.

"We have happy past memories, but not this time",London,Zurich,Europe,"We have had very good experiences with SWISS, albeit some years ago, so with that memory and a competitive price, we had no hesitation in using them for a skiing holiday in Austria, flying to Zurich. The outgoing flight was fine, although we thought the boarding process a rather slow affair. On both this and the return flight, we were notified the day before that our seats had changed, having paid for and not got the seats we especially wanted on the return flight, ie the emergency exit row  and seats C and D as we both like an aisle seat, it was disappointing that no refund is possible for other row seats allocated, we had seats D and E.I therefore conclude it is a complete waste of time, money and effort booking specific seats. The return flight was slightly delayed at outset by 30 mins which is hardly an issue, but again the glacial boarding process meant a delay of an hour, mercifully with no delay leaving due to a missed slot.  At Heathrow, the customary baggage reclaim games applied, my case was about the fourth delivered, unheard of in nearly five decades of travel, my wife's case did not appear and the baggage delivery seemed to slow to the pace of someone walking to the plane and then delivering one bag at a time. After an hour - with us having to update our taxi firm for our journey home - it was obvious that the missing bag was not going to turn up. Heathrow established that it had been left at Zurich by Swiss. I don't know how the baggage tracking service works, but her bag was delivered to our house within 24 hours, so I take my hat off to all concerned for that and thank them. I'm happy to retain fond memories of SWISS in past times, but the new SWISS is a different organisation and we will not be booking with them again.",January 2024,"January 21, 2024",1.0,4.0,4.0,,2.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0

Upon check-in we got a shock when we discovered that the 3 up-front seats we had booked and paid extra for had been changed and we were seated further back. We inquired why this change had come about and were told by the ground staff that there had been a change in the aircraft. However, later when discussing with Swiss and asking for explanations they told us this was not true.
The bottom line was that we bought up-front tickets and travelled in different seats than those booked and nobody seemed to care.
Need to point out that this is the third time that the customer service dept. of Swiss is totally absent when their assistance is needed and as a travelled I feel totally abandoned.",December 2023,"January 5, 2024",2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0
Inexisting customer service + Bad luggage management (delayed & destroyed !),Paris,Zurich,Europe,"It was a flight Boston-Zurich via CDG on Dec 22/23. At Zurich, the 2 suitcases were missing.

I replied that just because no other report which can be questioned, it doesnt conclude my meal box was not contaminated, and only mine. I had not eaten over 24 hours before this my flight and I know for sure, it was from the meal I had with Swiss Airlines ZH - SFO. I can always tell if I have had food poisoning.

"Uncomfortable and disappointing business class seat, I am still aching.",Zurich,New York City,International,"The backbone of the Swiss fleet is the Airbus 330. 
This is an old aircraft whose interior is in need of being spruced up. 
The dark brown color is pervasive and unappealing. 
The overall look is dodgy and sad.

This review is focused on the poor seat quality and the lack of the ability to rest and sleep.

Service was excellent (kudos to the two male flight attendants), and food was objectively good, but this is beyond the point.

The business class seat is undoubtedly below standard and definitively uncomfortable. 
More specifically there is no padding and it felt as if I was on a boardwalk. 
The mechanism to lower the seat in the sleep position is antiquated, loud with creaks, feeding the fear that the seat would not fully recline.

No padding on (1) the back of the seat, (2) the base of the seat where your buttocks rest, and (3) the leg extension.
The cushion is overall thin and worn.
The padding must have disintegrated or was never thick from start.
Even to compare it with the Lufthansa business seat, the Lufthansa one has a much thicker padding, in the order of the 2-3 inches, versus the Swiss seat that must be a tenth of an inch.

The armrest doesn't recline like the Lufthansa one that goes down when the seat reclines to a bed.

Swiss Air double charged me by over $1k and my credit card refuses to do anything about it,Belfast,Canton of Geneva,Europe,"In June, I booked a multi-country trip for my family (4 people) so we could see our relatives in Fribourg, Switzerland. I originally booked from Dublin to Geneva, arriving around 10pm August 20th. The flights were $227 per person. My family said the late arrival wouldn't be a problem. Days later, my family called to tell me they couldn't find a single train or rental car. Since we had an early morning appointment in Fribourg on the 21st, I called Swiss air and asked to change to a flight leaving from Belfast. The internet site was down with 404 errors so I called in and asked for the least expensive flight. I was told the Belfast flight was 310.20 and this matched the price on the website as well. 

I was told my total charges would be $1504.80 plus a rebooking fee of $66. I said that was fine. Swiss air had yet to charge my credit card for anything, and this flight was only about $80 more, which was less than a hotel in Geneva. I agreed. I had  even mentioned to the agent that I couldn't afford a flight more than $100 over the old flight. Days later, I got all of these charges to my credit card:

June 22-$227.70
June 22-$227.70
June 22-$227.70
June 22-$227.70
June 25- $66
June 25- $66
June 25- $66
June 25- $66
June 25- $310.20
June 25- $310.20
June 25- $310.20
June 25- $310.20

The total was $2,415 in Swiss air charges on my credit card which is an overcharge of approximately $910.00 and comes out to $600 a flight.

Since then, it's been an absolute nightmare to work with Swiss air.

For the first 40 days or so, Swiss air maintained that the original charges of $227.70 would just ""drop off"" my account in a maximum of 30 days. They encouraged me to just keep checking, but in their email responses they kept referring to a bank account even though it was a credit card. They'd respond by calling me the wrong name or the wrong gender. They'd ask for banking information insecurely over email and I'd give them more than I wanted just to get through it. They'd then ask for this same information over and over again. Sometimes they would get whole flight details wrong. Sometimes they'd only talk about the booking fee which I didn't care about, thinking that was what I was upset over. I'd explain over and over again, I don't care about the booking fee, I care about being charged for TWO flights in full. Agents on the phone talked over me to the point where I had to yell to try to get a word in and then they'd hang up on me for yelling.

In August, I took my flight (from Belfast) and then immediately begin disputing the charges with my credit card. I spent hours a week on the phone with both Swiss air and Citi for 6 months, explaining the same information over and over again. Swiss air sometimes responded that 310 was actually the difference between the new flight and the old flight. This would make the new flight 537 and not 310. I asked for proof the flight was 537. Over and over, they'd send invoices that say 310. When I called and said that their own information proved what I was saying, they'd just stick to their story about it still being the difference, even though previously they'd told me I'd be refunded and mathematically, it doesn't matter how much you say 310 + 227 = 310, it's just not true. Sometimes customer service agents would tell me ""well, thats how it's calculated, but the department that charges doesn't tell us the original price or the new price, but we know it's correct"". So you don't know A and you don't know B but you know A + B = C and I should just take your word that C is correct.

Citi got a merchant response from their dispute and the merchant response again ONLY talked about the rebooking fee and not the charge I was actually disputing. I kept asking Citi to keep it open and finally in December, I got a letter saying the matter was closed because I ""used the service"" meaning the 227 flight. I called and said it was literally impossible because that would mean I was on TWO flights the SAME time, so now we're breaking math and physics. The Citi agent told me, well Swiss air has terms of agreements that no matter what they charged you, you can't be refunded.

I have been constantly told I AGREED to $2405 in charges even though no agent ever mentioned that amount, I was told it was a REBOOKING, not an extra set of flights, there was a REBOOKING fee (which, WHY even have a rebooking fee?. It would have been cheaper to outright buy a new set of flights. Is it just to throw people off so you can say they agree to two charges if you confuse them by calling it a rebooking?) 

I am exhausted. I have called, emailed hundreds of times. I have contacted the FAA, the BBB, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. This is the worst customer service I have ever dealt with with any company in my life.",August 2023,"December 7, 2023",1.0,,,,,,,,
Good and not so good.,Los Angeles,Rome,International,"We were impressed that they had a vegan menu on the flight.  The attendants we busy and friendly.

"Worst customer service, paid extra for ancilliaries, flight got cancelled never received my money back",Amsterdam,Denpasar,International,"After writing 7 e-mails in the lenght of 2 months to ask for a refund, nobody ever responded. 

Bought 2 business class tickets from Amsterdam via Zurich to Singapore. From Singapore there was a codeshare flight to Bali with Garuda.

I purchased a ‚Ç¨ 229 ""throne"" seat in business class because it is their show horse. I wanted to test and try the product myself as I work in the travel branche. 

Because of my anniversary we have deliberately choosen to make a 1 night stopover at Singapore. I booked the very expensive Marina Bay Sands hotel for this special occasion as well as a taxi from the airport to the hotel v.v.

Already in Amsterdam we knew the flight to Zurich was delayed. And since we just had a one hour lay over we also knew we would miss the connection to Singapore. The staff told us that we had to get on board to Zurich and that we should figure it all out once there. So that's how it went. Once in Zurich we saw our plane to Singapore taking off. 

The Swiss staff at the desk were very nice and helpful and rebooked us to the next flight out to Singapore the next morning. They booked us in an IBIS hotel somewhere downtown and since it was middle of the nights there was no shuttle anymore. We had to grab a taxi and the price was 60 euro's one way, so we paid 120 euro in total.

We missed our stay in Singapore and it was non-refundable as well as our taxi as it was all cancellation within 24 hours. 

In total we lost almost ‚Ç¨ 1400 on taxi's from Zurich Airport to IBIS hotel v.v., for throne seats in their business class flight which we were never on and we lost our anniversary night in Singapore. 

I would expect SWISS air to give reaction to my emails but from August 2024 til december 2024..... nothing. There is JUST nothing.

I feel violated.,Belgrade,Zurich,Europe,"Awful airline. They checked me in into a flight that was clearly delayed. As soon as I got to the gate shortly afterwards they had a ‚Äúdelayed‚Äù sign displayed with no other info and no staff available. Had to call the customer service 3 times to learn that the flight was delayed at least 2 hours, which meant that I was going to miss my connection. Phone service agents were barely ineligible and simply read predetermined scripts without listening to my concerns or actually trying to provide any info or help me.  They refused to even try to reroute me on different flights. They parroted out that I would have to make a change of my flight at a transfer desk in Zurich. But this meant that I would have to attempt to find an alternative route at 9p in the evening (as opposed to early in the day) at a desk staffed with just two agents and with dozens of other people trying to do the same. After lengthy wait I gave up, bought a ticket myself on an alternative flight the following day, reserved a room in the hotel and left. I simply could not even deal with this anymore - felt treated as a cattle as opposed to a valued Star Alliance Gold member. In the future, I will avoid Swiss at all cost.

Obnoxious air attendant!,Zurich,Newark,International,"I just came back from Italy to US by Swiss international air line. I am still processing what just happened to us! Horrible, Arrogant, Extremely Rude and Obnoxious air attendant that we have encountered during the trip! The passenger sitting behind me got special meals so he ate first. Before I realized he started his meal, a female air attendant asked me to straighten up my seat which was not all the way back but I immediately adjusted my seat anyway because I always ask passengers sitting behind me if I could push my seat back a little bit every time I travel by air, given how small and narrow legroom is on flights! However the passenger sitting in front of me pushed her seat all the way back and there was no way for me to eat my meal properly. So when my meal arrived, I was asking the attendant to tell this passenger sitting in front of me to straighten up her seat so that I could eat. This air attendant rudely responded to me that I could have asked the passenger myself! First of all, I thought this is air attendants job as passengers don‚Äôt listen to each other and may get into a fight which I would avoid as much as possible; secondly she asked me to straighten up my seat! Why was I treated so rude and differently? Was it because I am non white and both passengers before me and behind me are white?!

Before landing, my 6 years old girl threw up so we were asking the same air attendant (there was no other air attendant around us) where we should dispose the waste bag. Again, she refused to take and dispose the bag herself, instead, she was asking another air attendant to dispose the bag! Due to these two episodes, my husband told her that she did not have to talk to us so rudely!After that, she started shouting at us that she had been working for 8 hours, stop asking her to do the work! As if we were asking so much and making her work so much! The half of the flight could hear her shouting! I have traveled so much and have never seen that air attendants could shout at passengers! Has all this happened is because we are non white as she behaved very sweet towards white! We feel strongly disrespected, insulted and discriminated! I am still bewildered what we did made her behave like an animal barking at us! 

This whole experience with Swiss air crew staff has completely changed my mind that I would visit Switzerland one day! I will never visit this country nor take this airline again in my life!

No compassion following mums death,Mahebourg,London,International,"Swiss Airlines processes are absolutely awful.  Following my mums death I had to change flight dates for my mums granddaughter and great granddaughter. I asked the agent that answered the call for the cheapest option to change the tickets, so that they could pay their final respects to my mum.

I asked whether they could wave the change fare, the agent advised that I would need to send in the death certificate- I sent this in and Swiss Air refused to waive the change fare as ‚Äúmy mums grandchild and great granddaughter was not related to my mum‚Äù. How they were able to jump to this conclusion from just the death certificate I have not a clue. I sent in proof, with all the  births and marriage certificates and still I was told that they were refusing to cancel the change fee. The agent on the phone passed me on to the supervisor who advised that the decision had been made and there was nothing that he and his team could do. So I had to pay over ¬£1000 to change the tickets so that
my family members could get here on time for the funeral.

I have complaint to Swiss Air so that they can look at their procedure, this is so that others don‚Äôt go through this at a time when they should be dealing with their grief. 

I have just summarised my experience with Swiss Air so that people can read the relevant information, the full experience was absolutely awful. I will say that it took several calls (some of which I got cut off), to several different people and it over 2 and a half days before time was no longer available for me to appeal to Swiss Airs decision or compassion for their customers.

I feel really let down by this company, especially at a time that I was feeling so vulnerable and distressed.

My sister who had to change her travel dates with Emirates took 10mins over the phone to change with no issues, just had to pay for the difference in flight (¬£60 for each ticket)

A Disappointing Encounter with Swiss Airline,New Delhi,Prague,International,"My recent experience with Swiss Airline has regrettably been far from satisfactory. It pains me to recount the numerous challenges I faced, coupled with a level of customer service that left much to be desired.

The primary issue revolved around a triple charge for a flight change, an ordeal that persisted for almost two weeks. Despite diligently following the advice provided and using the company's contact form, my attempts to address the matter were met with a prolonged and disheartening silence. This lack of responsiveness left me with the impression that the experiences and feedback of customers may not be as valued as one would expect.

The absence of a proper apology for the inconveniences and troubles I endured further compounded my frustration. Shockingly, upon reaching the airport, I discovered that my ticket had supposedly been changed, yet no ticket had been issued. The information and instructions provided by the airline were often confusing and unclear, making the entire experience needlessly distressing.

Remarkably, my worst travel experience during my recent trip, which included a visit to India, happened with Swiss Airlines. The airline's lackluster customer service, refusal to offer compensation, and the absence of formal apologies intensified my disappointment. 

In addition, the prolonged holding of my funds without clarity and the incomplete information provided during the resolution process only served to deepen my confusion and frustration.

Regrettably, I have made the firm decision not to utilize Swiss Airlines' services in the future. I feel compelled to share this experience, as transparency is crucial when selecting an airline. The lack of responsiveness and the overall dissatisfaction I encountered must be acknowledged and addressed to prevent further reputational damage.

In summary, my experience with Swiss Airline has been marked by a significant lack of professionalism, an absence of proper apologies, and a level of customer service that can only be described as abysmal. It is my sincere hope that the airline reflects on this situation and takes the necessary steps to improve its customer service standards.

narrowest seats and smallest luggage space,Los Angeles,Zurich,International,"I  flew from LAX to Zurich and back to LAX with Swiss airlines.

The overhead luggage space is so narrow that you should put your carry-on sideways. Their planes are not really suitable for long distances. I guess rich Swiss people travel business class so they don't care.

"Swiss Airlines' Epic Fail: Utter Disarray, Lost Baggage, and Customer Abandonment",Zurich,Amsterdam,Europe,"My recent encounter with Swiss Airlines has been an absolute catastrophe, and I feel compelled to share this cautionary tale of incompetence. Brace yourself for a story that exemplifies the epitome of a travel nightmare.

In a feat that defies all logic, Swiss Airlines managed to lose my suitcase on a direct flight from Zurich to Amsterdam, catapulting it to a destination of its own choosing ‚Äì Cyprus. The absurdity doesn't end there; attempts to reach out for assistance have proven futile, as Swiss Airlines conveniently lacks a phone number for distressed customers.

Despite the supposed convenience of an AirTag, which showcased my suitcase enjoying an unscheduled vacation in Cyprus, Swiss Airlines appears to be indifferent to my plight. Their customer service, or lack thereof, has left me stranded, frustrated, and utterly abandoned.

Swiss Airlines, your level of incompetence is staggering. Losing luggage is one thing, but the complete absence of customer support is downright disgraceful. Your negligence has not only disrupted my trip but has also thrust me into a state of helplessness.

Consider this scathing review a public service announcement: Swiss Airlines is a sinking ship of irresponsibility and indifference.

Bad Experience with Swiss Air,Zanzibar Island,Montreal,International,"My wife and I purchased flights from Zanzibar to Montreal and had paid for seats in Economy Class with Swiss International Airlines. Swiss booked us on 3 flights and 2 connections, one in Zurich and Vienna. We took the first flight from Zanzibar and made it to Zurich on time but we only had 40 minutes to catch our next flight. In order to catch the flight to Vienna, we had to take a train and change terminal, we also had to go through passport control and security again, while waiting in long lines. We therefore missed our flight. There is no way we could have caught that flight. Swiss should not book passengers on such short connections when passengers have to go again through passport control and security.

Terrible underpayment for loss of checked luggage violating the MONTREAL CONVENTION for delayed luggage.,Boston,Canton of Geneva,International,"Somewhere between Boston, MA and Geneva, CH, Swiss Air lost both my wife's and my luggage... for a total of FIVE DAYS!
Upon arrival in Geneva, we purchased two pairs of ""walking shoes"" as we fly in lightweight slip ons, and my wife bought two T-shirts and two bras for a little more than 400 Euros.
On day three, with  no help on the status of our lost luggage,  we bought a large roller bag since we had no idea when/if we'd receive our luggage for 300 Euros plus a couple of blouses for my wife.
On Day Five, Swiss Air notified us our luggage was back in Geneva, while we were on a river cruise out of Lyon. We ended up paying a taxi driver 440 Euros to drive to Geneva airport, pick up our luggage, and drive it to the ship's dock in Lyon.
Under the MONTREAL CONVENTION, Swiss Air should have reimbursed us for ""up to $1,700 per passenger for lost, damaged or delayed bags"".
Swiss Air only offered to pay us $300 for ""First, necessary purchase"" in Business Class as we would be ""able to enjoy our purchases once we returned to the US"" according to their policies.
The difference isn't worth paying an attorney to resolve, and we received a check from Swiss Air, finally, on October 25, 2023 for just $820... a little more than half our out-of-pocket expenses; much less the terrible inconvenience during our otherwise, enjoyable, French river cruise.

An unethical immoral and dishonourable company .. don‚Äôt give them any of your custom.,London,Zurich,Europe,"Due to the air traffic control issue on the 28th August I was stranded in Budapest and could not return to the UK to meet the Swiss air flight that I was catching the next day to fly out to Zurich.

I then bought another flight direct to Zurich thinking that my return ticket from Zurich to London would then get me back home.

Swiss air cancelled both my outgoing and return flights London Zurich as I had not boarded in London .and called it a voluntary cancellation.

I filled in a request for a refund due to the fact that I had not boarded in London because I was stranded in Budapest due to the air traffic control issue which was not of my making .

Swiss air made me pay ¬£840 to repurchase two return tickets from Zurich to London which I had already bought once already for ¬£550.

My request for this to be waived after a 6 week delay for them to take a decision was because it did not meet their terms of carriage.

Swiss airlines a fibber,New Delhi,Chicago,International,"Here are a few tips before flying this airline:

This airline tricks you a lot on codeshare flights. They only restrict you only one checked baggage of only 23 kg and one carry on bag up to 8kg. Only HON Circle gets more kgs :(

Their cabins are old and need refurbishment. Inflight entertainment doesn't work the whole flight and they can't even fix the issue. The remote had an error message ""PAC"" which meant Passenger At Control which the crew can control your screen and select a movie.

The food service gets run out easily. I was either left with the vegetarian meal for lunch and dinner. But got sausage and omlette for breakfast.

The A330 has middle bathrooms, so if people accidentally walk to the galley while the crew is sleeping ?? 

I had gotten called to security because of a baggage issue which was first called out at Delhi. A portable fan which malfunctioned had to be checked before traveling

One positive thing to note about the crew and the food quality were so nice. I appreciated it.",August 2023,"October 21, 2023",1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

Dash to the gates and then another passport check queue (which was a sham - coz when the flight take off was getting delayed they just waived us through after stamping our boarding passes).

While seats & infotainment systems were good, the crew was RUDE. They treated everyone with utmost contempt. Refused to fill in the water bottle of a co-passenger. My elderly mom-in-law needed water and the crew refused to give it when I went to fetch it in the galle area. I had to go again after 15 mins because the service was so slow and she grumbled and gave me a glass of water.

1. First of all the the first flight was delayed by 25 minutes , So it reached Zurich half and hour late . Everyone who had to take a connecting flight missed the other flight. It should be the duty of Airlines to guide us and to ensure that we don't miss flight of the same country. The departure and arrival segments of the airport are like 25-30 minutes apart. We were provided a new ticket of Austrian airlines which was 2 hours late and our luggage got misplaced and provided to us after 10 hours

AABSA = Any Airline BUT Swiss Air !!,London,Cairo,International,"In my review dated September 8, I detailed the issues I and many fellow passengers on the same flight experienced entirely due to a 2-hour delay at LHR Terminal 2. In my case, this resulted in my checking into my Cairo hotel some 24 hours after having checked in my baggage the previous day. 

Since formalising my complaint on September 8th (Case no. 2309-LX-06197) to Swiss Air, no formal response was received until September 22nd. In addition to their obligation to refund Euro 600.00, I have asked for my expenses incurred because my baggage was delayed by 4 days, reimbursement of costs of food greater than the derisory 'food voucher' I was given and an ex-gratia payment to cover the untold stress and inconvenience caused by the delayed flight and appalling levels of 'customer care'. Needless to say, I am STILL (!!) awaiting even the common courtesy of  an acknowledgement close to 3 weeks after having responded to Swiss Air, far less a formal response addressing these remaining issues.

Manifestly, this is an attempt on the part of Swiss Air to block the matter with a wall of silence. Their shameful performance has made me all the more determined to pursue these outstanding matters as relentlessly as I have the time to do so.

"Bad policies, greedy company",Zurich,London,Europe,"Swiss has a policy, that with Light tickets (that are still super expensive), you can't preselect seats.  That's fine.

What not fine is, that during online checking, just 10-12 hours before departure, you still can't select seats, and by default they intentionally put everybody in the very back of the airplane (even when there is full empty rows more to the front).  They only do this, to blackmail money out of people.

This policy is completely unacceptable and evil, nothing less than what we would have expected from this new budget airline, called Swiss.  Of course, as expected, they still charge the old non-budget prices for tickets.

Also very nice representation of their mentality: if it's free for us, and good for the customer, we will still under no circumstances help the customer in any condition at all.

On the return flight they cancelled our flights because they thought we no showed the original flights (even though it was Swiss Air that changed the ticket to accommodate for their original booking mistake.) Thank God we figured it out the day prior to leaving but it still took hours to correct and we lost our seats together for a 9 hour flight which we paid extra to have.

Formerly great SWISS now unaccountable and unflyable.,San Francisco,Zurich,International,"How the mighty have fallen. SWISS was our go-to airline for travel to/from Switzerland. I felt that the hefty premium paid to fly with them was justifiable for comfort, courtesy, reliability, and amenities. Those days are gone.

We flew from San Francisco back to Zurich last August. After a time of great personal challenge in our family, I wanted to gift our 11 y.o. daughter a business-class experience. We had already paid nearly $5,000 for two round-trip Premium Economy seats, but upon checking in online, we were offered an upgrade to Business class for CHF 300 per ticket on our journey from SF to Munich/Munich to Zurich.

When I clicked on the 'fixed price upgrade' box, it showed an upgrade option from SFO>ZRH for CHF 300 per seat. That includes both legs, from SFO>MRH and MRH>ZRH. It did not offer an option to upgrade each leg individually. I selected the upgrade for both tickets and paid CHF 600. When it took me to next to seat selection, it showed both legs, SFO>MRH and MRH>ZRH, but SFO>MRH was greyed out, and only MRH>ZRH was available. I made those seat selections; however, the Bombardier CRJ900, a commuter jet, doesn't have a first-class or business-class cabin.

There is no way I would have booked an upgrade on a 31-minute flight (for a class doesn't even exist on that journey), let alone for CHF 300. None of the customer service representatives I spoke with afterward disputed this.

I called the airline the following morning and the customer service agent said to get our seat assignments at the check-in counter.

We did as we were told. Adding extra complexity (or insult to injury, as it turned out) was that we were ticketed on SWISS by flying Lufthansa, which rates 1.2 on Trustpilot (1 is the lowest score). I think our customer service rep. was a trainee, but both she and her trainer said to check in at the gate for seat assignments, as they couldn't see our upgrade from SF to Munich.

A Lufthansa customer service representative in Munich later confirmed that we were indeed ticketed in Business Class for the entire journey from SFO to ZRH, but that the information was on a second screen, and undertrained employees didn't know where to look for it.

At the gate, we spoke to six different representatives, who said we only had an upgrade on the Munich to Zurich leg: all agreed that that didn't make any sense. I asked the supervisor, Ms. Bayarmaa, where the accountability was. She said, ""There is no accountability here.""

The chief flight purser Frau Nagel commiserated with us and said the same thing happened to her when Lufthansa said, ""You didn't pay enough for an upgrade"" and refused to seat her in her Business Class. She took a detailed statement from us, put it in the voyage record, and said I would hear back from the airline shortly. I never did.

I took up my concerns with Gerald Schloegl, Managing Director of Miles & More GmbH and a VP at Lufthansa. He replied, ""first of all, I apology for the really bad customer experience. I will forward your request to the right internal contact person, so that your concern will be resolved as soon as possible.""

That person was Silvia Reiner, Consultant--Premium Feedback Services. Her replies were courteous but continued to claim erroneously that we had only paid for an upgrade from Munich to Zurich. Since we were involuntarily downgraded, I invoked our right under European Regulation No 261/2004, entitling us to a refund of 75% of the fare paid for all flights since the journey was longer than 3,500 km. Frau Reiner refused but offered a credit of CHF 400 as a courtesy.

Then both Herr Schloegl and Frau Reiner ghosted me. I will receive my remedy by filing our EU Regulation form for involuntary downgrade and receive our 75% refund.

As far as Swiss (and their partner Lufthansa), Ms. Bayarmaa was correct: there is no accountability here. At least I should be grateful for her candor. As for SWISS, they are a shadow of their former selves and I will take my business elsewhere. I suggest you do the same.",August 2023,"October 10, 2023",1.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0

Swiss charged me a penalty for a glitch in their app,Zurich,Chicago,International,"This is a complaint about Swiss charging me a penalty for a glitch in their own system. This is not a complaint about having to pay baggage fees, I understand that those are customary. But I find it pretty outrageous to be charged more, even though the Swiss agent agreed that the app was at fault. Please let me explain:

I checked in on the Swiss App the day prior to my Sept 28 flight from ZRH to ORD. 
During the process, I added one checked bag and printed the luggage tag at home.
At the airport, I dropped my bag with the assistance of a Swiss agent.
At no point was I asked to pay for the checked bag. This did not surprise me. I remembered having paid over $2,800 when I booked these flight back in June, but did not remember whether a checked bag was included or not.
When I noticed on the boarding passes in the Swiss app that our seat assignment had been changed and my wife and I were no longer seated together, I went to the Swiss agent at the gate. 
She advised me that the seat assignment on my Swiss app was incorrect, but still ok in the system. Then she proceeded to ask me to pay for my checked bag. This seemed weird to me since I had added the extra bag on the Swiss app and was not advised about a fee and was able to print the luggage tags without being asked to make a payment.
I thought this was strange, but agreed to pay for the checked bag after confirming that my fare did indeed not include a checked bag. The agent told me that the Swiss app should not have let me print luggage tags without asking for payment. Oh well, I understand that technology can be glitchy and I was willing to pay the fee that should have been charged when I added the bag. However, I was surprised to be charged the higher rate of CHF105 for paying at the airport instead of the CHF70 which it should have been according to the Swiss website when adding a checked bag online.

Really? Swiss is charging me a penalty for a glitch in their own system? The agent confirmed that I should have been prompted to pay before being able to print the luggage tags, but when I asked to be charged the online rate since I did add the checked bag online, she said she could not do this and I can complain about it if I wanted to. Not the service I had expected from Swiss. Very disappointing, less so because of the CHF35 difference, but because of the audacity to charge me for an acknowledged error in the Swiss app.

"Run, run, run from this airline.",Chicago,Zurich,International,"As others have noted, customer service is lacking in basic competence and ability to problem solve in an effective manner.

Swiss cancelled my original flight and re-booked me on a BA flight leaving the next day.  Well, when I got to the airport BA had no seat for me on the flight, Swiss had never actually finalized the re-booking. 

When I went to the Swiss agent at ORD for their assistance, the first thing she told me was ""you're a BA passenger now, I can't help you""

So here I am, now two days later, hoping to get on (yet another) re-booked flight for tomorrow.  I can only hope the third time will be the charm.

"Incredibly, unbelievably, strikingly inhumane",Bucharest,Canton of Geneva,Europe,"So....me and my friends were travelling from Bucharest to Geneve. After boarding on our first flight (at 6:35am) we waited until after 8am to fly off :) According to the information our pilots gave us ""the colleagues from the ground that were supposed to help us fly off...."" were nowhere to be found :) Forgot to mention the best part of it all (dear parents, may I have your attention): we were waiting for the beloved ground crew in the exotic temperatures of 30¬∞C and all the children on board were crying because of these lovely conditions. Of course the staff gave us water but I think that is the absolute bare minimum in the given situation. Aaaaanyway, 8:30am we were already flying and the beloved plane crew politely asks us to go to the beloved ground colleagues if we had any questions for our connecting flights (which a lot of us had).

"Don't ever, repeat EVER (!!), fly Swiss Air connecting through Zurich.",London,Cairo,International,"Original flight was delayed due to a discrepancy of 1 between the ground crew (LHR T2) and air crew (Swiss Air) passenger counts. An extremely protracted process accounting for the discrepancy could have been considerably shortened by an immediate match of boarded passengers to boarding cards and the seats we were all occupying. The departure delay of 2 hours (!!) on a flight which lasted considerably less caused many MANY passengers to miss their connecting flights from Zurich, including myself, missing my onward flight to Cairo. 

Ground crew, border control staff and security personnel  in Zurich were disinterested, in some cases unhelpful and in one case, extremely rude, all contributing to the profound stress experienced by every one of the many passengers who missed their connecting flights to many destinations

After locating 'Transfer Desk A' eventually, I stood for 90 minutes in line to be issued with a very small value food voucher, a Lufthansa flight ticket to Frankfurt and an onward connecting flight on Lufthansa to Cairo. Both of these flights were also delayed so I landed in Cairo some 22 hours after having checked in for the original flight from LHR Terminal 2. 

My suitcase which was checked in at LHR Terminal 2 has STILL not arrived, some 36 hours after having made my missing baggage claim shortly after arrival in Cairo. The local phone numbers (1 landline and 2 mobile numbers) to call with the claim reference I was given are not answered after repeated attempts.

Paying customers have every right to expect a considerably higher level of care, assistance and support from Swiss Air if and when their service is disrupted.

Firstly, when I attempted to cancel the flight, instead of receiving the assistance I expected, I was directed to a chatbot on their website. This automated system left me with more questions than answers and failed to address my concerns adequately.

The most disappointing part was the refund they offered ‚Äì a mere 35 EUR for a flight that originally cost me over 500 EUR. This refund not only felt like a slap in the face but also seemed completely unjust considering the original ticket's cost.

"Fly Swiss, just hope that all goes smoothly otherwise you are in the deep...",Zurich,Singapore,International,"Although the service itself was decent, this is the second time that I experience great inconvenience on a Swiss flight. The first one was years ago when the first leg of an Athens/Zurich/Singapore flight was cancelled and I was re-routed through Moscow airport with Aeroflot without being consulted. I ended up missing a day's meetings.

The most recent incident was last March when I arrived in Singapore and received a damaged suitcase. I filed a claim and was advised that the suitcase would be picked up from my hotel and repaired. I pointed out that Singapore was the first stop of a Far East trip with 6 stops, so my suitcase was badly needed in 4 days when I would take off again to continue.

The suitcase was picked up from the hotel 2 days later, only to be returned in 20 minutes advising that they did not have the neccessary parts to repair it. The local claims handling agency told me that they would not be further involved and I needed to sort this out with Swiss directly.

As I needed to continue my trip I was forced to buy a new suitcase and throw out the damaged one. I tried to find as close a match to my original suitace in size, make and quality. The replacement cost was SGD 329 or roughly 230 Euro. Having kept pictures I took the matter up upon my return with Swiss, filing a follow up claim. They re-directed me to another claims handling agency who, 2 months and numerous reminders later advised they would compensate me with 40 Euro! Alternatively they offered to pay for the repair cost but I advised them that the suitcase had been disposed as I could not carry it along on all my subsequent flighs. They then increased their offer to ‚Ç¨61.98.

Bottom line is that my bag arrived broken and Swiss was unable to either repair it or provide an alternative for me to continue my trip. I was forced to buy another suitcase and realise that a discount would be reasonable but 73% I believe is insulting. I was forced by Swiss' inability to provide alternatives to dispose of the broken bag and buy a new one so I find it unreasonable that I have to bear that cost.",March 2023,"September 3, 2023",2.0,,,,,,,,

These people are usually really great and I've been flying swiss due to family and friends who work for it my entire life with friends tickets. For the first time though I made a booking on my own on their website and experienced the most incredibly worst costumer service ever. My booking didn't go through correctly on the website and also not my payment. I contacted them by E-Mail/ phone many times. I even switched from German to english to see if I get a better costumer service but nothing helped. As in german someone even told me in the end, ""ok he can't help me, I should ask the Chatbot on the website!"" While some staff told me that there is nothing wrong with my booking and I just have to wait it's in process, but they don't know how long it will take. Others told me if it's not paid than there is no booking. Two of them offered me they can make a new booking but only for the current rate, which was more expensive by now. I obviously said no to that because 1. of all my other booking still existed and 2. they should for sure offer me the same price as it wasn't my issue to be solved and pay more. I tried and gave them my credit card information 2x but each time I received the wrong booking confirmation again and no payment taken off. I told them that not even a reservation appears on my credit card and thats not normal. My card wasn't the problem, I checked with the bank and everything and was always able to do bookings on other websites too. So it was clear, that the problem was their website or booking system. Yet no one was able to help. I gave them literally a month and each week I was trying to reach them for help. Therefore after an entire month, I had to make the decision to tell them to cancel all completely and I booked my flight with another company. Never again will I book with Swiss. Literally I had way better and faster costumer service on every single low-cost airlines I booked with. I never in my life experienced such a bad service.

I had heard positive things about Swiss long haul but that wasn‚Äôt my experience on this trip, mainly due to the seat on the long haul section (Boeing 777) which seemed very narrow, very hard with very narrow and hard arm rest. I was extremely uncomfortable after a very short time onboard due to how hard the seat was. The leg room was average and fine and was not a problem (I‚Äôm 6 foot). I had also read the food was good but again I found it below average in taste, quality and quantity. There was no offer of water from the crew during the flight other than meal times, in fact the crew just kept out of the way and spent most of the time chatting to each other at the back of the plane disinterested in the passengers. 

I was sold a very short connection in Zurich which turned out to be risky as the Manchester Zurich connecting flight is almost always late and in my case was over 1hr late with only a 50 min connection. The gate agent at Zurich was quite abrupt and rude which I couldn't understand as we literally ran to the plane it was the airlines fault we were late but he lectured me about being late and that if there hadn‚Äôt been so many of us on the late Manchester flight the Singapore flight would have gone without us (obviously happy in his work).

Now the perfect Swiss first flight,Sao Paulo,Zurich,International,"Greetings ) This is my 6th flight in Swiss first this year 2023. And I wish to tell, that, when you get proper team without prejudice, you receive just amazing service and everything. 

First of all, I wish to tell, that Swiss lounge First near E gates is the really best 1st class lounge in the world. You can drink Macallan, that appeared in it once again after corona-crysis, eat michelin-star quality Swiss deashes, spent some time in private hotel-style room with shower, and finally taste a lot  of different whiskies in whiskey-bar for Senator lounge nearby. 

When I visited this lounge first time in 2019 actually I was so full of everything, that I just could not consume anything on plane, I just falled asleep and that's all :) 

I visited ANA first class lounge in Japan and many other lounges, and definitely Swiss is the best. 

Overall all Swiss 1st class experience - lounge + plane is unforgettable experience, which you could not meet in simple Switzerland. When you step out the airport - life is grey and quite depressive there. But in Swiss first you can feel sparkling luxury Swiss life, like no other. 

In a plane - Swiss finally renewed it's WIFI access conditions. Now First class passengers get unlimited good internet for whole flight. 

Cuisine is also awesome. The main and signature dish of Swiss first is Salmon Balik. I can promise you, that you never tasted such kind of Salmon, not in Norway, not in Ireland or somewhere else. It is really really good and wonderful taste Salmon. Of course there is no regular caviar unfortunately, but you can get in in a 1st quarter of the each year. And portions are quite amazing. 

Other food is also good and well decorated. 

Diamond of drinks in Swiss first is currently perfect Remy Martin XO. When I travel with my wife, we often consume right one bottle for 2 persons through the flight.. It is really good, you can drink it like water actually. Of course, there could be better options like Extra age cognacs, but regarding price/quality ratio it is amazing option for travelling in Swiss first and your condition after consumption. 

When you meet proper team on board that understand your needs, flight just becomes awesome and pure pleasure. 

We had such a flight just 2 days ago. 

Despite the maybe 2nd hardest turbulences in my life during flight, the flight team made the flight just amazing, comfortable and absolutely without any remarks. 

One more thing I wish to mention. Live in Switzerland is much more expensive than in OAE for example or even in Japan. But Swiss team managed to make such a great service that just as good or even better in some aspects (like lounge experience for sure) than first classes of the other developed countries for the same ammount of money or even lower.

Dishonest Airline That's Blatantly Violating EU Law,Dublin,Zurich,Europe,"Swiss International Air is a dishonest airline that's blatantly violating EU consumer protection laws. 

I booked a ticket and subsequently needed to change it in full compliance with the ticket rules. Those rules carry a reasonable 60 EUR change fee plus the difference in fare. However, the airline would not honor their own published price for the new ticket. 

There was no functionality to change my ticket on their website, so I had to contact the call-center. They tried to sell me the new ticket a price that was considerably higher than the price offered on their own website. When I complained and informed them that they were violating EU law, they told me there was nothing I could do about it and, ultimately, hung up on me without the matter being resolved.

Can‚Äôt Rebook; Bad Website; Bad Service,Miami,Dubai,International,"It‚Äôs been many months since I booked through Kayak to get on Swiss Air. What a terrible experience. I could not imagine worse.

I had to rebook the flight.  I had every right to do so based on my ticket.  I contacted Swiss Air with plenty of time to switch my trip.

The Swiss Air website seemed to be allowing the rebooking.  It was a long process.  When I got to the last window after having set everything up, I hit submit.  The website said it was having a technical problem and to try again.

I tried maybe three more times.  Went from start to finish of a long process. Each time, the website gave me an error message and told me to start over.

I got on the chat function sometime in the midst of it.  It was cumbersome too.   was continually cut off.  The chat function wasn‚Äôt working after restarting three times.  Each time I had to start from scratch and fill out the information before I could get a chat rep.

Sometime during all this, I took to the phone. I tried calling four times.  I was disconnected with no call back twice.  I realized that they were hanging up on me at one point.

I won‚Äôt go through every weird thing that happened, but the strangest was that when I did get a representative on the phone, I had to go to the website and explain from the list of alternate flights available for rebooking what I wanted.  I would identify the flight, and the rep would tell me one of two things‚Äîeither the flight I was made to lookup was indeed not available or that it was seven hundred or so dollars to do so though I had the right to rebook and it quoted online, where I was made to look by the rep, a rebooking price of little over $100.

This is nuts.  I never was able to rebook after trying for 3.5 hours.  I am not in any way exaggerating that time.

So I never was able to cancel or rebook.  It turns out the flight to Dubai was over a full day late in departing because I was still getting flight details and updates on my phone.  There were no odd weather events or worker strikes.  No reason was given for the multiple delays.

Had I taken the flight, I would have missed the meeting that was originally scheduled.  I would have been in the air and not on the ground.

I‚Äôm very surprised this airline has a 3.5 rating.  Maybe the flight itself, once in the air finally, was a pleasant experience.  Maybe they always are and so they‚Äôve earned a 3.5 rating.

I can say the website is useless for rebooking.  The chat function is likewise.  The representatives on the phone are no help and cut you off.  I am mystified why the rep can‚Äôt help me rebook and quote me times, dates and prices without me first telling him or her what flights I want to rebook to from the website‚Äôs own listings.  I do not know why the website information didn‚Äôt match the prices and times the rep quoted me after selecting a flight from the website.

Inaccessible and discrimination for passangers with disabilities,Johannesburg,Zurich,International,"""I flew economy on Swiss airline in May from Johannesburg to Berlin with a layover in Zurich. It was my first time on Swiss airlines and I have to say it was my worst flight EVER.

When I arrived at the counter, I was told that they do not offer any assistance for visually impaired passengers. I told them that I had called and they said it was fine. The lady then proceeded to explain that they offer wheelchair assistance to ""actual disabled and older passengers"". I insisted that I called, no one told me and that I have a visual impairment, there's no way i can find my way. Rhe lady at the counter told me, ""sorry you are going to have to go by yourself because we don't offer that service on swiss airlines. A lady who aparantly escorts first class passengers overheard and said she'd be willing to take. Problem solved? No. When we walked she was telling me that they help disabled passengers in wheelchairs and that if anyone asks I must just sit in the wheelchair to which I responded that it's discriminatory to assume that a disability only means being a wheelchair user and it excludes a lot of people who need help. She insisted that it's not discriminatory or exclusionary because I can just sit in the wheelchair. The worst part was not this, but that when we got to security and then passport control, I was told that she cannot go with me and I'll have to do those parts myself, I couldn't find the passport control counter of where the they were calling me and everyone laughed at me and rhe man checking the passports scolded me. I somehow managed to go through and the lady who helped me before was on the other side telling me that ""I should just listen where to go next time"" and again she told me to sit in a wheelchair when we get to the gate and when I get to my destination. So we get to the boarding gate and no one asks me to get into a wheelchair, they assist me to the plane everything's good and she tells the airhostess that I'm visually impaired and need assistance to my seat. The hostess then take me to my seat without saying a word and seemed very annoyed. The seat seemed pretty fair and I thought the worst was over. After a few minutes the hostess comes back and tells me that my seat has been changed. When I asked why she just told me to go and gave me the new boarding pass. I asked where to go to which she responded that I just get up. I get up,not having a clue where to go or where this new seat is. I stand in the aisle for a while until someone helps me to my seat. The new seat, at the back against a wall in what seemed like an area where everyone else had huge extra leg room, I do not know if this was a different class or what but I was in a row that is the smallest row and the smallest legroom trapped against a wall with the seat in front of me coming so far back that I can't see on my screen and the chair is pressing down on my knees (I'm 1.65cms). I felt so claustrophobic and pressed against a wall. After a while in this environment I started to feel sick. I vomited in the bathroom 3 times and a few times with a hostess walking by, I asked for water. The first person ignored me and the other times they told me they'll bring it but never came back with water. By the time I reached Berlin, I was feeling dizzy, dehydrated and as sick as can be. Upon arriving in Berlin, a man from the meet and assist team told me to wait as he needed to help passengers with disabilites. I told him yes that's me I'm visually impaired and need assistance to arrivals. He then responded yes but the older people and people with disabilities get priority. I did not know how to respond and just waited. After about 40 minutes he comes back and starts giving me advice on how to cope at airports. The wonderful advice is that I should listen where to go. Annoyed and sick I decided to tell him that I can't listen signs and written content, there's no sound to a boarding gate number or the aisle numbers or where literally anything is. Sound will only help me not to walk into a wall maybe. 
Finally I get to arrivals to my friend and nearly passed out. Never ever again will I fly Swiss.""",May 2023,"August 7, 2023",1.0,,,,,,,,
Loved the whole experience,Miami,Venice,International,"From the moment we checked in at Miami airport until we got our bags in Venice, everything about Swiss Air was 5 star.

Jennifer escorted us from the MIA check-in desk to the Swiss lounge where she found us a place to sit before our boarding time.  Then another person came and got us and walked us to the gate to board.

On board, it was even better.  From Nadine the purser to Claudia Fuchs the FA to the captain coming by to say hello preflight, the Swiss team could not have been friendlier.

The food was delicious and they fed us so much we were stuffed before we went to sleep.  They made up our beds which were comfortable and soft.  The only complaint was it was a bit warm in the cabin.

On arrival into Zurich, someone collected the first class passengers on the jetway, escorted us to a waiting van and we were driven to private customs which took about 2 minutes to finish.  We were then escorted to the lounge to wait for our connecting flight to Venice.

Once in the lounge, we took a shower in the well appointed shower rooms.  It was lovely after a 9 hour flight.  We had a quick cocktail before heading to our gate for departure to Venice.

Worst customer service !,Brussels,Johannesburg,International,"I recently had an incredibly frustrating and disappointing experience with Swiss Airline, and I feel compelled to share my distressing encounter with others. Despite being a loyal customer and having booked a business class ticket, the treatment I received was far from satisfactory, leaving me deeply disappointed and dissatisfied.

My journey began on 01 July 2023, with my flight scheduled to depart. To my dismay, the flight was delayed for a 1 hour and 30 minutes. Swiss Airline cited an alleged ""unexpected flight safety shortcoming"" as the reason for the delay (and so the reason why to not give a compensation), but this vague explanation left me bewildered and questioning their integrity as the pilot was mentioning the delay since the morning. I sought clarity and requested concrete evidence regarding the purported safety issue, but my efforts were met with repetitive responses that failed to provide any substantial proof.

As if the delayed departure was not enough, the subsequent series of events plunged me into an even more distressing situation. The delay resulted in an agonizing 24-hour wait at Zurich airport, and despite being a business class ticket holder, I was treated as an afterthought. To my disbelief, no hotel rooms were made available (if they knew we were missing the connecting flight and no hotels in Brussels, why not leaving us in Brussels?), and all I received was a measly 20 CHF compensation for a full day's worth of sustenance. This treatment was a far cry from the premium service I had expected, leaving me feeling undervalued and disregarded as a customer.

The ordeal did not end there. Due to the overbooking of the following flight from Zurich, I was subjected to further inconvenience and chaos. The airline rerouted me through Frankfurt, compounding the delays and causing me to arrive late for crucial meetings in Johannesburg. The additional transportation costs and the disruption to my carefully planned itinerary were both frustrating and costly.

Throughout this harrowing experience, I attempted to engage with Swiss Airline multiple times, seeking fair resolution and transparency. Yet, to my dismay, their responses only reiterated the same unconvincing explanation of ""extraordinary circumstances,"" with no evidence to support their claims. Their lack of transparency and accountability in handling my concerns only added to my frustration.

I find it deeply disheartening and unacceptable that Swiss Airline seems to prioritize its interests over the well-being and satisfaction of its passengers. As a customer, I believe it is my right to receive adequate information regarding significant delays and the reasons behind them. The lack of communication and empathy demonstrated by Swiss Airline during this incident speaks volumes about their approach to customer service.

To those considering flying with Swiss Airline, I implore you to think twice before entrusting your travel needs to this airline. My experience has left me with little faith in their commitment to customer care and satisfaction. It is my hope that sharing this review will serve as a cautionary tale and prompt Swiss Airline to reflect on their practices and strive for genuine improvements in customer service.
Please keep in mind that this review reflects my personal experience, and your own encounters may vary. However, I firmly believe that open and honest feedback is essential for the growth and improvement of any industry, including aviation.
May your future journeys be more pleasant and stress-free than my regrettable experience with Swiss Airline.",July 2023,"August 4, 2023",1.0,,,,,,,,
Swiss air won't reimburse expenses,Dubrovnik,Ottawa,International,"Delays, delays, delays.... technical issues with the plane, unknown bag left near the boarding area, weather delays, then just a cancelled flight at midnight and no staff to provide hotel accommodation assistance, etc.  I asked the staff at the desk 5 times over 5 hours if our flight would be flying that night as I said I have to get home and would rather just rent a car and drive home.  Of course the rental companies were closed by midnight, so I took a cab back with a stranger to Ottawa for the last leg of my flight.  As I provided the stranger with 1/2 of the fare cash, and don't have a receipt Swiss air is unwilling to pay for my $180 share of the ride.  They say they would have paid for my hotel, expenses, beverages, etc., and had a plane for me 18 hours later, and would have paid for my expenses if I had receipts.  I said this would have far surpassed the $180 cab ride home, but of course they don't seem to care.

I guess people are just supposed to assume they can go to the Montreal Ritz Carleton, eat caviar all night, and get reimbursed?  Just don't expect to be compensated if you decide get a drive home at 12:30am, arrive at 3am and want to see your family in the morning that you haven't seen in 3 weeks.

Swiss Air We Dont Care,Singapore,Amsterdam,International,"Very happy with the flights.  No so happy when both my wife's and my bags did not arrive. We lodged the report as advised.  This is with a separate company as Swiss Air do not deal with customers for the first 5 days. We were told the bags likely missed the connecting flight from Zurich and would arrive the next flight.  That didn't happen. 24 hours after our arrival we found out, by me initiating contact, that my bag had been found but we would have to pick it up at the airport, at our cost, as it was too late to deliver. That was the first 2 examples of poor service.  We picked my bag up and saw the huge number of missing bags they had.  Some seemed to have contact details but we still in the lost area. How they managed to lose both our bags, to obviously different locations, is quite remarkable.
They provided a website to tell us the status of the lost bags.  Over the next few days we checked regularly but nothing changed.  It still showed my bag as awaiting pickup which was wrong.  Numbers that we were given to ring either didn't answer or were wrong. Customer support was useless, they only care about bookings. The best offer we had was to get a number in America to ring (we are Australians in Europe.) No use at all. Eventually we left it with our cruise director on the Viking ship we were on. They were chasing other bags as well. After a week we were told the bag was being flown to Frankfurt and would be sent to the ship from there. That never happened. I suspect it was sent, sat there and then returned. The next update was it was going to Munich. We had no further advice about it. After Viking eventually confirmed it was there they dispatched a driver to pick it up and bring it back to the closest port.  They then put it on a ship that would meet us in Vienna. After 14 days my wife got her bag, no thanks to Swiss air.
I lost track of the number of calls and emails we and Viking made trying to get the bag.  At on stage Viking spent over 4 hours on the phone trying to get answer. They we just totally unresponsive to nearly all calls and emails and the website updates were appalling and mostly non-existent. If not for Viking sending a car to Munich we would not have received the bag at all. We had our emails on our bag tags but that was no help.  How hard would it have been for someone, once the knew it was unclaimed, to open the tag flap, see the email and let us know where the bag was and find out where we needed it sent.
If you have got this far here are our tips
Photograph your suitcase because you will have to describe it if lost
Photograph the contents because you will have to describe that too
Get an electronic tracking tag
If they give you a number to call check it will be answered before you leave.

Yesterday flew into Zurich from Palma de Mallorca. Again delayed, already departed with a delay from Palma. Arrival in Zurich was a gigantic disaster, as an eledged medical emergency (more likely from what I obseved the passenger had eaten dood in bad state and too much of it), was managed so poorly that passengers were forced to be trapped in the plane for a further 30 mins for no reason - it would have been totally possible to let us het out without disturbing their over the top medical assistance.

Symply wonderful flights,Zurich,Chicago,International,"We were happy to enjoy Business Class on the Boeing 777 for this flight to Chicago. Very comfortable and with enough space and a large screen. We had already checked in online at home, including baggage tag, so we only have to drop off our suitcase. As Zurich airport is always busy in summer, we were at the airport in time. The security check is separate for business passengers and so we were through surprisingly quickly. We also used the automatic passport control at customs without having to queue, and we were immediately in Dock E. We had plenty of time to go to the observation deck, which is very nice. If everyone was properly prepared, packed their hand luggage correctly and also went forward at the security check, there would be no long queues. 
We departed a little later, but still landed on time. The flight was very relaxed with nice weather. The crew had a lot to do with because a full flight and special requests from some passengers. Nevertheless, they always remained very friendly. The fact that you can choose your main meal from 9 menus days before the flight is a real bonus. Unfortunately, this only applies to departures from Zurich, as well as for the regional specialties from Switzerland. Meals from Zurich departures flights are always much better then meals on return flights. 
We enjoyed this flight and also the return flight very much from beginning to end. There was absolutely no complaint.

think twice if you re choosing Swiss!,Warsaw,Hong Kong,International,"I have chosen economy premium flight from Warsaw vias Zurich to Hong-Kong. At the start, here was a flight delay in Warsaw, and i have noticed, that Swiss almost every day offer flight Waw-Zurich with huge delay, so this is nothing extraordinary. 
We missed out connection in Zurich. We had to walk very far to the Transfer desk and wait ca 1 hour on line to get a new flight for next day. it resulted in 24 hours delay, and completely ruined my plans  in HK. We were offered a voucher and transfer by shuttle to hotel but without our suitcases, just with hand luggage, where i had just one tshirt and my pills, no toiletries etc. 
next day we were provided with breakfast in the hotel, then had a day to kill. Zurich is not most interesting place in the worls, this day was additionally extremely hot, so we decided to spend some time on boat trip around the lake, then had some beer in the city and back to hotel for kind of lunch.
on evening again we have been in airport. 
plane to HK started with more than hour delay.
Althought chair in premium economy was ok, food and service was below expectations and service provided by competitors like Cathay Pacific or LOT Polish Airlines. Both of them are offering better food in premium economy (LOT especially is offering Asia inspired menu and better selection of wines). Food is Swiss was just average, breakfast was exactly the same as in economy. service was totally uneficient, it looked that crew is working for punishment or so ;-) 
Really, not so often you so so uninterested in providing good sewrvice staf like in Swiss.
When in HK, i have put a claim for compensation for delayed flight and a lost  one day accomodation in hotel Royal Garden in HK.  They promptly responded declining my request, and argument was, that delay of flight from Warsaw to Zurich was extraordinary, what was not true, because at least since 10.07.2023 to  26.07.2023, flights nr LX  1353 from Warsaw to Zurich NEVER left Warsaw on time, and always there have been delays. So, delays of this flight are permanent!
If Swiss is aware, that plane  from Warsaw to Zurich is always in delay, as a reliable airline, they should reschedule my flight before it started in Warsaw. There were erarlier flights from Warsaw to Zurich that day.
Finally because they have refused my claim at all, i turned case to Swiis Aviation Authority and to my colleague Swiss lawyer to start procedures.
Hope this airline will bancrupt again and never be re-launched.

Lost luggage!!!,Dublin,Canton of Geneva,Europe,"Never use Swiss Airlines! My luggage was lost in transit from Dublin to Geneva originally coming from Newark.This caused me to have to wait at the airport and miss the last train to my hotel in Geneva. All my clothes were in there, and I have all the receipts of the clothing and necessity items I needed to get while on my trip. This is unacceptable and it left with no clothes in a foreign city. It was an extreme inconvenience, and I was stuck missing things I had planned in my itinerary because I was going around Switzerland trying to find things for both the summer and the winter activities. I lugged a trashbag around Switzerland for days until I found a reasonably priced bag that I could use to travel home. My husbands clothes were also packed in my bag. His luggage had the sneakers and winter coats. So it not only affected me, but my husband as well. This ruined our one year wedding anniversary trip and caused unnecessary troubles. We had to do laundry on our vacation, which we never have to! Not only did I not have my luggage for the trip, it still hasn‚Äôt even shipped and it‚Äôs been over a week.

We had a smooth experience with the airline without any issues.

Unnecessary Stress,Zurich,Chicago,International,"I seldomly write negative reviews when it comes to any establishment. However, with Swiss Air, I am quite frustrated with their discrepancy and inconsistency when it comes to carry on baggage.  While my suitcase, I can understand a little bit more but my husband‚Äôs, his was easily within the requirement.

Once on board the aircraft we became extremely annoyed to find many of the overhead bins had plenty of space and contained bags similar in size and I imagine weight to ours. Interestingly enough,  some of business select class were allowed to carry on bags that were larger in size and were able to fit in the overhead bins with no issue. 

With being forced to check our bags, our tight connecting flight became even tighter with a delayed landing and waiting for our check bags to go back through customs and security.  We truly almost missed our flight because we were forced to check our carry on bags. Surprisingly, we had no problem carrying on to any of our other 3 flights.

Aside from the carry on issue, the plane was extremely tight for leg room. I will say the one positive was the friendly flight attendants. I had very high hopes of flying an international airline because many friends and family members have spoke highly, I am not impressed with them.

I am confident this airline is not the only one that has these absurd policies but here we go.  Family Vacation was booked in November to fly to Greece in July.  As the dates for our flight came closer I needed to change my departure date due to work.  I noticed that the name on my ticket is my common Alex and not the proper Alexander as on my passport.  I honestly did not feel this would/should be an issue.  Since I had time I called the Swiss Air customer care line to adjust. The agent said she was only authorized to add or remove 2 letters from my name, this would still leave me 3 letter short. I said ok what are my options to resolve this MINOR issue. Answer, cancel your ticket and rebook (in my case that meant receiving only the taxes back). Clearly not a good option. I said there must be something else.The agent said no that is it, I asked is this a law or something from the Air Authority.  Her response, no it is just company policy. 
 Wow, something that can be controlled by Swiss Air.  I asked for a supervisor or at least someone with more authority to help. I was put on hold for 45 mins to only have the line cut out. I called back a few times and oddly each time I had someone that seemed as thought they were in fact trying to help the line cut out. I was 1.5hrs into this. Finally I was given an email address to reach out to. I did this as well but no one came back to me without being prompted. I reached out again and then received help from a live agent that said Swiss Air document dpt approved the name correction. Success yes, hurray. No it was not, I was charged a name correction fee of $30, then some other fee of $150 and then the real kick in the teeth, I was forced to pay a fare difference. My total cost to change 5 letters of my first name was a whopping $1100 dollars. I find it beyond comprehension that this was the only solution.  It took over a week for me to get to this place and when the agent said is there anything else I can do for you. I said well can you offer something more for me such as a credit or upgrade just something. Her response was we can only book you the same ticket that you had before. In the end something really needs to change as it is ridiculous that an airline agent cannot help correct your name. Yes, it was an error in my part when booking sure, charge me for that part.

From start to finish, the entire journey was plagued with issues and setbacks. First and foremost, the customer service was abysmal. The staff seemed disinterested and unhelpful, displaying a lack of professionalism that I found extremely frustrating.

Furthermore, the flight itself was far from satisfactory. The seats were cramped and uncomfortable, leaving me feeling cramped and restless throughout the entire duration of the flight. The lack of legroom was particularly unbearable, making it nearly impossible to find a comfortable position to sit in. Additionally, the in-flight entertainment was severely lacking, with a limited selection of outdated movies and TV shows. It felt like a step back in time rather than a modern travel experience.

To make matters worse, the food served on board was tasteless and unappetizing. The meals lacked variety and were of subpar quality. I was left feeling unsatisfied and hungry, which only added to my overall dissatisfaction with the airline.

Lastly, the airline's punctuality was highly questionable. My flight experienced a significant delay, causing me to miss an important connection. This lack of punctuality and disregard for passengers' time is simply unacceptable.

All in all, my experience with SWISS airlines was marred by poor customer service, uncomfortable seating, lackluster entertainment options, unappetizing food, and significant delays. I would strongly advise against choosing this airline if you value a pleasant and hassle-free travel experience.

Staff at the counter ruined  the SWISS image for me,Antalya,Zurich,Europe,"SWISS

Herewith I would like to express my strong and serious disappointment with the Check in process with SWISS July 7th  for the flight # WK177 Antalya to Zurich .  Before my flights I have checked all the docs required  for me , my husband and the small dog with SWISS web site and called to the call center several times 
- what I faced at the check in at Antalya airport today  - the absolutely incompetent young and very stubborn lady at desk # 143 who kept us 45 minutes to check in ! What a shame on SWISS IMAGE !!! 
all documents rules and transits passengers rights need to be clear written in the instructions and (!) attention (!) well learned  by airline supporting  staff - that lady at desk 143 she was terrible in the way she treated us and she did not know anything , she was asking her next desk colleagues every single steps , she was calling all the number and many times ‚Ä¶till her radio‚Äùs get flat out of battery -:))) 
The queue behind  us was very angry and had to move to the other counters with more competent ( hope ) personnel- that was huge delay !!!  And after all it took her another 15 min to go to the office and to make photocopy of the pet‚Äôs passport and certification. Never seen in my life raging with my dog  for 7 years so much efficiently at the checking -in process . 

And to crown it all  she sticked only 2 out of 5 language pieces tags on my passport. 

Take a look at your staff - learn from TK or Lufthansa on the best practices in processes and  please  improve  . Why SWISS does not allow to pay extra language pieces and pets in cabin in advance on-line or by phone? What happened to the service you used to have before ?  Why I pay so much for the flights  and face that low level service at the entrance ?

Horrible... AVOID!,Newark,Brindisi,International,"After flying with over 15 different airlines and traveling to numerous countries around the world, I can confidently say that Swiss International Air Lines is the absolute worst airline I have ever flown with. They have deleted my return ticket because I asked for a date change without my permission and didn't even inform me. 
I called them a few days before my original return date to see if I could change my return flight to 2 days earlier than planned. they said yes and went ahead and changed my ticket as well as sent me a confirmation email with the new dates. a few hours later I received an email saying that my credit card used for rebooking charge didn't process. I gave them another call and this time the customer service rep said that I actually can't change my ticket and I would need to fly back during the original return date. 
a day before the original return flight I couldn't login to see my booking using the reference number so I called them again to learn that my return ticket was 'deleted'. They said because I asked for a change and it was not possible there were two booking under my name and they cancelled both. They robbed me off the return flight that I payed months in advanced. 
I was told by the customer service rep this time that I could rebook my deleted return flight with a penalty and the fare difference if I preferred... it is unbelievable but this is what they told me. When I got frustrated I was told by the customer service rep that maybe I should 'go away and think a little bit'... 
I ended but buying an entirely different one way ticket home that costed me over $1,000 in addition to the $1,900 roundtrip ticket that I already paid for with Swiss. 
They are rude and they literally steal your money in broad daylight and don't even try to fix their mistake... Worst airline, worst customer service.. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!",June 2023,"July 6, 2023",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Swissport service for the delayed luggage was terrible.,Los Angeles,Zurich,International,"I flew from LX to Zurich on UA622 and UA9807, operated by Swiss Airlines, on May 31, 2023. After waiting for a considerable amount of time at the carousel, my luggage failed to appear, leading me to suspect that it may have been lost or delayed. Consequently, I approached the Swissport service staff for assistance. Despite my initial wait, the staff advised me to continue waiting. However, when I approached them for a second time, the same staff member informed me that they were unable to locate my luggage. They instructed me to fill out an e-form and assured me that they would contact me once they had additional information.

However, a day passed without any phone calls from Swissport. Growing concerned, I took the initiative to call them myself on the second day. The staff member I spoke to once again confirmed that they were still unable to locate my luggage and asked me to remain patient. Regrettably, the third day arrived, and I still hadn't received any calls from Swissport. During this time, while waiting for their call, I took it upon myself to search online for more information. Fortunately, I managed to find the necessary details and locate my luggage independently.
It is disheartening to think that I had to personally find my own luggage instead of the Swissport staff fulfilling their promise to contact me. Despite being repeatedly assured that they would reach out, I never received any calls from them.
While traveling from town to town, I wanted to ensure that Swissport knew my intended destinations. Therefore, I contacted them once again to confirm if they had received my luggage in Switzerland and to update them with my new address. Fortunately, they confirmed that my luggage was indeed in their possession. However, I was informed that I needed to contact the carrier directly to update my address. Following their instructions, I promptly called the carrier but was directed to email them my new address. I complied and sent the email, but my concern grew when I repeatedly called the carrier numerous times to confirm if they had received my new address, only to have nobody answer the phone.

Feeling frustrated, I reached out to Swissport once more for assistance. To my surprise, they informed me that it was necessary to provide them with the updated address, not the carrier. This contradicted the initial information given by Swissport staff, causing further confusion and inconvenience. Despite the fact that I was relieved to have located my luggage with my own efforts, the overall experience was marred by the lack of coordination and inconsistent instructions provided by Swissport.
Later in the day, the driver called me, the only call I get from whole dam process, telling me that the luggage was delivered, but to the old address where I had already left. I had to wait an extra day without my luggage on the fourth day. 

On the fifth day, I made another early morning call to the carrier to ensure they had received my new address and to coordinate with the landlord for access to my apartment. I was informed that my luggage was en route to Zermatt, and I stayed in regular contact with the landlord for any updates. However, despite the expected delivery time provided by the landlord, I received no calls from the driver, and the promised time came and went without my luggage being delivered. Frustrated and running out of patience, I decided to check downstairs myself. To my surprise, I found my luggage left unattended in a public area. It was only then, on the fifth day, that I finally retrieved my belongings. The entire experience was a nightmare.

The level of service provided by Swissport and their carrier was abysmal. They showed no regard for the inconvenience they caused their customers. There were no updates provided, no notification when the luggage was delivered, and a lack of communication throughout the entire ordeal. I intend to share this terrible experience with my friends and family, cautioning them to think twice before choosing Swiss as their travel option.",May 2023,"July 3, 2023",1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0

They have no clue about how to handle difficult situation per customer. There is no transparency within the company and no clear communication between Swiss Air and Lufthansa.

SWISS simply DONT LIKE CYCLISTS WITH BIKES,London,Canton of Geneva,Europe,"I pre booked a second piece of luggage as I was bringing a bike.

The ticket agent at the airport registered it for me, but operations would not load it as there was already 3 bikes checked in (three being the maximum capacity...how can that be?). I spoke on the phone for 22 minutes with a Lina at Swiss customer services looking for a solution. The best she could offer, now after the flight had closed, was telling me to contact the cargo departure and book the bike separately. I then had to rebook my flight and travel on the 17.15 flight, paying a fare change fee of AED 561.22 and delaying our travel by 10 hours.

Got an email at the 11th hour saying flight canceled then a follow up saying rebooked China airlines via Shanghai.

China requires a visa even for transit on the same airline which I didn‚Äôt have or even know about it never used to be a requirement and Swiss made no mention of it. So somewhat expectedly my passport was taken at Shanghai by immigration and I was to a room with no idea what would happen next. After a long anxious wait I was allowed to continue to Singapore without explanation and somewhat traumatised. After my trip was over I got a reply to my email to Swiss merely confirming my Air China flight and in no way addressing my concern.

Horrible Experience,Zurich,Frankfurt,Europe,"This was one of the worst experiences ever to book a Swiss airways flight. I travelled with my family to Switzerland in June 2023 and when we booked a return flight from Zurich to Delhi, we got connecting flights on a single PNR :
1) Zurich to Frankfurt (Swiss airways), 19:05 Departure, 20:15 Arrival
2) Frankfurt to Delhi (Air India), 21:15 Departure, 08:30 (+1) Arrival

The problems are many with this combination:
1) Swiss Airways doesn't allow more than one checkin luggage per person (even when they are within weight limits)

2) Swiss airways leaves you at terminal 1 but gate A while Air India departs from Terminal 1 only but Gate B. The distance from Gate A to Gate B is too large and if you are travelling with family with aged parents, let me guarantee you that you won't be able to catch the Air Inia flight. 

3) Since there is hardly anytime between 2 flights, there is no scope for delay.. however our Swiss flight departed 25mins late, and hence we arrived at 20:40 in Frankfurt.. imagine our situation as we were travelling with parents

4) I paid extra money to get the front row seats so that we will be the first one to exit from Swiss flight. But just 2 hours before the flight, we got the message that  the carrier has been changed. Now it's a new flight and we were assigned seats in the middle. Wow!!! Then why did we pay for the front seats?

I called specifically to get window seats and they were confirmed but when we got our boarding passes someone changed it so we were all seated in the middle row. Yay. 
The seats were placed so close together that my boyfriend who is a very average height couldn't even squeeze his backpack between his legs to put under the seat, and even that was almost impossible to do because there was no under seat room. I'm 5'4"" (about 165cm) and even I had a hard time sitting comfortably in the seat. On the positive it did have a good headrest so that helped during the little bits we were able to get shut eye. 
Food was terrible. I was served pasta and it was soggy and overcooked, it barely had any sauce, nor any flavour. The bread and butter were ok and the dessert was also gross. The only thing that was actually decent was the breakfast croissant. My boyfriend said his beef stew was pretty ok so if you're given that choice avoid the pasta. 
Another thing that's fun about flying on the Swiss airlines is that they wake you up on a red eye when they serve food so that the person behind you can eat but the lady was rather rude about it. As if my 11 year old daughter flying to Europe for the first time is supposed to know these things... so getting back to sleep was fun. Not really. We were trying to get sleep because of a 620am arrival, which meant barely any sleep.

This kind of last-minute alteration is unacceptable and demonstrates a complete disregard for passengers' time and convenience.

Moreover, when I raised my concerns and lodged a complaint regarding the unnotified flight time change, the response from Swiss Airline's customer service team was deeply unsatisfactory. They tried to pass off the delay as an extraordinary circumstance beyond their control due to air traffic control restrictions. While I understand that such circumstances can occur, it is the responsibility of the airline to promptly communicate any changes or delays and provide suitable alternatives or assistance to affected passengers.

Oh Dear - Cabin Crew need much improvement in service,Zurich,Boston,International,"Have been flying around the world Business Class with Star Alliance for more than a decade. 
I don't know if the cabin crew were trainees but the service was well below par.
It was bizarre.
Meals were haphazardly served, with some receiving their meals and drinks , while others were still waiting.

We asked for coffee and after 20 minutes I went up to the galley where the flight attendants were standing, chatting, eating snacks. 
I asked about our coffee and was told the order had been ""sent up"" (to where?) and they didn't know - it was coming!

So back in our seats, some time later, asked for a drink of coke. On her way back to the galley, she took an order from another passenger, never to appear again.
 I could see her standing in the other aisle at the galley drinking and eating.

So, I tried again and called the attendant - I never do this.
Along she came, a different one and I asked for a drink - Of course, she said and then like the others disappeared back into the galley, to never appear again.

How hard is it to serve drinks and meals?
They had to have been trainees with no supervision because they could not be this incompetent.

The check in counter should be more educated people in charge. In Manchester airport there was an Indian looking lady looks very uneducated, rude and unprofessional. As check in is the gate for consumers to enter their journey, the check in process should be smooth and delicate so there will be no grudges during the on board experience. Because I got bad experience in check in process, it became very uncomfortable for me to continue the journey.

THEY DO NOT REPLY TO EMAILS.  So the customer is literally talking to a wall with no hope of ever interacting with a Swiss Air person.  The only Swiss Air employee that you can reach on the phone are reservation agents that will not discuss any customer service issues.

Brussels-Johannesburg 24 hrs delay; SWISS not respecting EU261 reimbursement,Brussels,Johannesburg,International,"Flew from Brussels to Zurich with Swiss LX789 February 26th, 2023.
Flight was delayed due to preceding delay on arrival in Zurich from where it had to depart (was told by the lady at the gate in Brussels). Flight was delayed two more times after it was mentioned that airplane had departed Zurich (very strange as only further delay can happen when airplane is kept in holding pattern just before arriving in Brussels!).
Due to the accumulative delay chances were slim that i would catch my connecting flight LX282 from Zurich to Johannesburg but the lady at the gate convinced me to take the flight anyway.
As expected, i missed my connecting flight and there was no other option than to take the next scheduled LX282 flight 24 hrs later. Missed one day of meetings and conference due to this.
Have been mailing and calling with SWISS customer support for several months and SWISS has been doing everything to avoid compensation. Latest vague feedback was, that delay was due to operational circumstances and therefore not  in their control. Have asked copies of airplane logs which would prove the exact reason of the delay (operational delay can be anything and are no extraordinairy circumstances). SWISS refused to provide this proof but only would supply this if it was forced in a court case. Have now opened a case with my legal insurance company to get to the bottom of this.

EasyJet is better,London,Zurich,Europe,"Haven‚Äôt flown with Swiss for a while and after finding myself unexpectedly on Swiss again because I happened to need to fly from Heathrow, I remember why. A desperate, grubby experience with an airline pretending to offer a full scheduled service but in reality cramming economy passengers in with less legroom than EasyJet and offering a schedule plagued with delays. 

The airline no longer recognizes my Miles & More card so I‚Äôm in group 5 getting on. By this stage my fellow passengers are being denied their one allowed cabin bag and the airline staff are desperately weighing bags to give them a justification to take cases away from anyone with the temerity to have one weighing 8.0001 kg or more.

The onboard staff on my flight were grim-faced and unhelpful, refusing to help an old woman struggling to get her bag in the overhead compartment. To another, who asked for help, they were curtly told to do it themselves. I know that‚Äôs probably some airline regulation, but really? 

The thing I can‚Äôt bear about Swiss is the incompatibility between their prices and their services. At least EasyJet doesn‚Äôt pretend to offer anything but a no frills service. The Swiss service is no frills in economy but you still pay a very full fare - fine if someone else is paying but if, like me, you pay your own fares then you have to admit there are better alternatives.",May 2023,"May 21, 2023",1.0,,,,,,,,

Terrible experience in business class,Zurich,New York City,International,"Mar 20th 2023, I boarded LX 14, from Zurich to JFK, everything was fine till about 2 hours in to the flight.  Had a lovely flight attendant serving me and I had 3 drinks then ate my dinner and had two more drinks....then I have never felt such prejudice from a flight attendant.  This man came up and told me that business class flights of 9 hours are capped at 3 to 5 drinks.  I have flown almost every major airline and always in business, I fly about 50 or more flights a year.  Is this Swiss Air policy I asked and he said yes it is, so I asked even though you can clearly see me speaking calmly and the fact that I am completely sober which I always am and I have never had one issue on a flight.  So, is this policy and where is it written??  I did not want to bring up the race topic as he was very friendly with all the swiss speaking people and non colored customers.  From that moment on I did not get offered anything, you are talking about 6 hours left in the air.  Even the second meal offering was not mentioned and no one even stopped at my seat.  When I got off the plane 2 gentleman came up to me and said ""I can't believe that happened to you and how they cut you off after hardly any drinks""  and then they both had the same experience with the terrible service and both were shocked that a second meal was not even offered and that hardly anyone checked on us.  I got both their names in case I have to get this out to the media.  One is ex-government but broke his arm skiing so could not drink and said he would have lost it if he was told there is a 3 to 5 drink max per 9 hour flight.  Also, I wanted their names incase someone questioned if I showed an ounce of intoxication which I can tell you is impossible....In Canada we can drink 2 drinks an hour and still drive so saying 5 drinks in 3 hours with a meal is a max is unacceptable considering I paid for this service.  I own many corporations and understand employees can not be trusted and always like to give management a chance to rectify an employees terrible actions. I have a picture of this flight attendant he was the head one as he was in first class when we were landing and I have a video of how nice he is as he touched shoulders of the first class customers and a picture of him as well.  I am a 44 year old successful Arab/African man and the way I was treated definitely made me feel prejudice and frankly it was embarrassing for someone like me who is semi-retired and travels the world on vacation about 200 to 250 days a year.

Undoubtedly the worst customer support I have ever experienced,Dublin,Bangkok,International,"Myself and my husband booked non refundable flights for our honeymoon. We found out due to unexpected medical reasoning we were unable to travel at that time. We called Swiss Air to speak about possibly rebooking and were told that wouldn‚Äôt be a problem and to call back with new dates. We rebooked our accommodation and when we called bask with new dates we were told we could no longer change our flights. This resulted in several calls over many weeks to Swiss Air trying to get clarification and escalate this given we had a doctors note. The experience was my worst ever customer experience before for the reasons below:
1. When calling Swiss Air, after waiting some time and when you finally connect with an agent, the phone disconnects after 5-10 minutes. This happens every time if you are on the line for over a few minutes. This means when speaking with customer service and explaining your case, the call will suddenly disconnect and you have no way of contacting the same person again. This resulted in hours and days of trying several agents and constantly getting disconnected and ultimately getting no where with a request. My communication went on for 3 months in mid 2023 so there is no way this is a once off. They are aware of the problem and are not fixing it. 
2. Each agent had inconsistencies with their narrative and solution. We were promised one thing from one agent and this changed many times depending on what agent we spoke with. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be a clear playbook of rules and guidance. This was extremely frustrating being promised one thing and then this changing several times over several calls. There was no consistency or accountability whatsoever. 
3. When we finally got an email address to send our medical note for them to look into (this took 9 separate calls with a different agent every time), no one responded. I followed up three times over 6 weeks and there was no response. 

The huge and seemingly intentional issue with their phone lines, lack of consistency and accountability in their communication service and general offerings and escalation process as well as the compete disregard and ignorance of our medical letter and emails easily makes this the worst customer experience we have ever experienced and unfortunately ruined our honeymoon. This was very disappointing and I highly recommend avoiding Swiss Air at all costs.",May 2023,"May 8, 2023",1.0,,,,,,,,
Lost luggage and Zero customer service from Swiss Airline,Zurich,Edinburgh,Europe,"When we arrived at the Edinburgh Airport, from Zurich, one bag out of three was missing. The baggage claim office at the airport was closed, also a note at the window rereferred to the airline as the the responsible part for the baggage. 

So we decided to fill out the Swiss online  ""To Delayed Baggage Service"" form at home.

But the online form didn't work and we got following message: 
""We are sorry but you must report your delayed baggage to the last airline you travelled with. Please contact the baggage tracing office of the respective airline at the airport to report your delayed baggage.""

So we called Swiss Customer service to get some support:

1st Call: You need to report the lost baggage at the airport. After explaining that I cannot and also that the online form doesn't work, they gave me a number from Cita - 08000260142, the baggage handling company. Cita referred me back to the Airline as they aren't responsible.

2nd Call:  they hung-up on me after explaining them that we are in a deadlock situation as we cannot contact anybody at the airport or fill out the Swiss online form, and that I need Swiss Air to provide me a solution.

3rd Call: they suggested to give me the US baggage centre number, but it's closed now the lady said. She couldn't give me any number in Europe.

4th Call: Different person. I asked for the baggage centre number in Europe and I got one

5th Call: the number didn't work. The last digit was wrong, so I called again.

6th Call: I explained them that I called the baggage centre but they cannot help me without the reference number of the baggage claim. But I will only receive the reference number after successfully filing a baggage claim  online or at the airport, both ways don't work for me. 

7th Call: New strategy! I asked Swiss customer service adviser to guide me through the website on the fill out ""To Delayed Baggage Service"" form too. The adviser had the same issue.

They found my luggage after 4 days and then I contacted them with the receipts of my expenses which according to the law is my right to get reimbursed as it was their mistake. They replied me to contact the Latam Airlines which was the last airline I have traveled with because it wasn't their responsibility and they declared my case as closed. Their customer service was absolutely disappointed and if I could rate them under 1 star I certainly would. After that, I decided to contact Latam as they mentioned it and for my surprise and disappointment once again, the Latam said it's not their responsibility but Swiss. They play together against the customers. I think that's the way it works so I'm leaving here my honest review as an warning for you to think twice before booking with them. If something happens to your luggage I can assure you they will do nothing for helping you with the costs of your loss. That was my first and my last experience with them. I hope I will never travel with them again and I will never recommend them to anyone.",April 2023,"May 6, 2023",1.0,,,,,,,,

"""This is not a discussion"", they said to me.",Belgrade,Zurich,Europe,"It was a very unpleasant experience at the gate.

If we don't comply apparently the plane cannot take off. The announcement was made in Serbian so I had no idea.  As we were standing in the front, my husband offered up our bags for check-in and when I asked the staff why us and not others, she simply pointed me to ask the Swiss Air staff. I asked him and he said there was not enough space and if I didn't cooperate, we will not go to Z√ºrich that day.  I asked him who chose the bags and he pointed to the ground staff who didn't bother looking at me when I talked to her.

Finally, after all the discussions and unhappiness, I saw that only about 8 bags were taken while the rest of the passengers boarded with their bags.  

When I boarded the flight, I asked the staff why was my bag taken and the other 95% not, he said that because the bags were over 8kg and that he checked. I told him mine wasn't and that he didn't check mine. He simply told me off by saying that if we have this discussion, we won't go to Z√ºrich today. Was that a threat?

Saves you standing in long line-ups too. You will hear some really creative excuses or get shrugs if you ask why online does not work. The check-in staff are much less under pressure then too.
 In the plane, don't bother pressing the button to call for a flight attendant. That button was there when the plane was built, before economy really meant economy.

No food after being ordered with bad attitude about it,London,Port Elizabeth,International,"Absolutely terrible flight. I'm so frustrated and livid. I specifically called into Swiss Airlines the 9am the morning of our 22:40pm flight to ask for vegan meals for both my son and I. Time for good on the flight and the crew have no note of it. So one crew member asks me what is the difference with vegetarian and vegan, I then explain no dairy, eggs or honey. She comes back with the below for my 7 year old son and myself who is pregnant, to share. No cutlery, ice cold, and it's not vegan it's got cheese all on the top which makes me think if they can give me that as a 'vegan' meal then it's probably cooked with butter too. This they apparently scrapped together from first and business class. So I told him, now more frustrated and starving so they took it away. My son had an apple and banana for dinner, I had a pear and a kiwi fruit and a small quinoa salad they salvaged from somewhere.

Breakfast time hits, as they coming past serving everyone, the young gentlemen says they will look what's left over in first and business class when they don't serving. We've just landed, about to get off the plane and no one returned, not even with a piece of fruit for breakfast for us.

The attitude given was if I was an issue for them and its not their problem. I was just told, well sorry I have no note. So I said we'll that's a company problem, not mine cos I specifically phoned in to make sure we have food.

The toilet was somewhat smaller than on other airlines.  The cabin crew were pleasant and professional enough although the female cabin crew definitely looked like they would rather be elsewhere!

Worst Customer Service,Zurich,Chicago,International,"Swiss used to be a top level airline many years ago. However in the last few years their customer service has declined significantly. You just scan through the feedbacks here on TripAdvisor and see how many people complain.
For my flight booking, they made a mistake, which can happen. But when I called their priority line, they just said they cannot do anything. No apology, nothing. Flying Business Class and being a Senator member I would expect a bit more client orientation. It is very simple, just some nice words of apology would make the difference.

Class flight start to finish,Manchester,Dubai,International,"From booking to actual flight excellent service from start to finish. Originally booked Business Class at half the cost of Emirates and BA. Then upgraded return very cheaply, finally upgrading outward trip to First via the bidding process. My tip only bid what you can afford. On their bid grading it told me was fair not good or excellent but still won. So we ended up in row 1 for not too much money.

First part was using Helvetic from Manchester. Our Embraer 195 was very comfortable. Business class row 3 gave us 2 seats each. The food was a strange mix of vegetable omelette plus cheese and yoghurt but very tasty. Cabin crew very attentive and friendly. We departed 30 late arriving 20 late in Zurich.
Then the plus of First kicked in. Met by staff with private mini bus just for us as Helvetic flight arrived opposite side of airfield to the E gates for Dubai. Escorted to the departure level. As we were a little late straight to the gate where we were group 1 to board. First on the aircraft. Everything you do is VIP.

Onto the Dubai flight a Boing 330. Turn left and it‚Äôs your what seems like a private jet. Huge seats, large area of personal space. Massive tv screen. Top class champagne and warm nuts soon as seated. Personal service by the cabin staff throughout was top notch. On realising it was my wife‚Äôs birthday she received a gift and a card signed by all including the pilots.

Horrible Service - Avoid at all costs!,Chicago,Zurich,International,"This was our first and last time flying Swiss Air. 
The service on both of our flights was horrible and both phone agents and check-in agents were very unsure of basic procedures like seat assignments and checking bags.  The water was not working in one of the lavatories so no way to wash your hands unless you went to another one.  The breakfast we received consisted of yogurt and a small roll.  The seats in the economy cabin recline so far back that if the person in front of your decides to recline their seat you literally have their setback in your lap and face!  On our flight back from Zurich to Chicago after lunch was served the flight attendants closed the curtains at the back of the cabin and we were told we could not use the two back lavatories or go to the back to stand and stretch.  As a result the entire economy class was forced to use only two lavatories located at the front of economy class.  We figured out that the flight attendants were on break so they did not want anyone coming to the back of the cabin,  This lasted for well over an hour.  Only having two lavatories for an entire full economy class section is ridiculous.  The flight attendants only come back after a meal to collect refuse.  There was a cocktail napkin on the floor in the aisle and I watched flight attendants pass by for over two hours without bothering to pick it up.  
 My spouse and I had to pay extra for reserved seats just to be able to even sit together.  Was told no more $35 seats were available so had to pay $57 per seat.  The seating chart online showed many available seats in economy class.  When I called a few days before our flight the agent said we were booked in two middle seats for one of our flights, not the aisle and window seats that were originally confirmed.  The agent said she would move us back to or original seats (aisle and window) and send an email confirm.  We never received the email so had to call back again and found out we were still in 2 middle seats.  At the airport it took 25 minutes to check in with an agent due to the fact we had an extra bag we had to pay for and the agent could not figure out how to do this as we were part of a group.  The same thing happened on our flight back home.  Checking an extra bag is $100.  On our return flight the check-in agent told us there electronic payment system was not working so she had to call in our credit card number over the phone.  This took a long time and since the security line was long were barely made our flight.  
Our two friends had also booked economy class seats but they were crammed into middle seats in the last row of the business class section,  The last two rows of the business class section were economy class seats yet almost all of the business class seats were empty.  So they had the delight of watching the few business class customers receive a much nicer meal.  At one point during our flight my friend and I went to the back of the plane to stand and stretch.  A flight attendant quickly told us we ""could not congregate"" since the flight was heading to the United States and we were told to return to our seats.  On a flight that is over 9 nines long it is quite unacceptable not to permit someone to stand and stretch for a few minutes.  Avoid flying Swiss Air at all costs!

Horrible service on board.,Tokyo,Zurich,International,"After 3h consumption of Remy Martix XO really good cognac with my wife in 1st class, we were declined of further alcohol serving, without any reasons, our condition was perfect, and behaviour as well. Just no reasons. 

the way steward team acted to us, lead to total misunderstanding, horror atmosphere and totally discomfort, 

I paid tenth of thousand EUR + for tickets, and for my money filled myself in as a fool, gaining red eyes . 

flight for me is a certain ceremony, which I appreciate and respect, for example I don't need any alcohol after sleep or before ending etc. 

For me this ceremony was totally broken during the mentioned flight, without any reason, or any sign from my side! Just based on  baseless prejudices and offensive assumptions

If Swiss have some official limit of consumption of alcohol in first class, Swiss should publish it officially on a website, what are criterias, based on weight and passenger gender? 

or if Swiss don't have, and the criteria is good passenger condition - let 1st class passengers go in a straight line or spell alphabet, like police in the USA do?

I filled like a 1st class hostage on board, I filled like a boy, or student, that reached 1st class cabin accidentally, although this is my 15th flight in 1st class with Star Alliance... 

it's all very disgusting and disgusting, does not correspond to any level, I don't know what to compare with

The most wrecked situation became surrealistic, when a really drunk passenger from another 1st class seat started yelling standing over our seats, and woke my wife from sleep and the team did nothing without accenting the situation...

My husband and I landed in Ireland 4 days ago and were told they lost our luggage. We were told the first night that we would receive our luggage and a confirmation email would be sent to us the next day, which never happened. 
 
On day two we were told it would be ""expedited"" to our hotel at 10 pm, and again it did not happen. The next day we were told whoever we spoke to was misinformed and you do not have an expedite option. We were then given multiple phone numbers which were either out of service or invalid. 
 
Today, we were finally contacted by one of your Couriers via a man named Eduardo and informed our luggage would be out for delivery today. We left our vacation spot with family to drive home, and it has been 5 hours and no luggage has arrived.
 
Now, none of the couriers are answering their phones and we still have no luggage. It is 9pm. This has negatively impacted our trip, time with family, caused us to spend excess money to buy utilities we packed in our luggage and it is completely unacceptable.

Shouldn't be your first choice airline,Barcelona,San Francisco,International,"Previous long haul flights I've taken luftansa. Swiss is owned by luftansa so you would think similar service. The planes are similar interior, basic nothing fancy but luftansa is much more comfortable. The swiss flight from BCN to Zurich was smooth and no problems other than it was extremely windy during landing but the pilot did a great job. 

At the gate once in Zurich there was much miscommunication about what they wanted us to get stamped prior to boarding, multiple passengers were confused by their lack of communication. 

Previously I paid to upgrade my seats for my flight from Zurich to SFO once at check in they printed our tickets and the seats were separated and different than my original ones, I informed the front desk employee who seemed extremely overwhelmed she fixed it but upon boarding I realized the seats were still separated. Lucky no one was sitting next to me so my spouse could sit with me for our 12 hour flight. 

During the flight the seats were much less comfortable than other airlines I've been on. The wifi was not unlimited and even for $60 still not unlimited is ridiculous. Food was basic chicken or pasta. The flight attendant for our section, he was very impatient with everyone and rude commentary.

Awful customer service experience and unresolved issue,Chicago,Cairo,International,"I originally purchased business class tickets through United Airlines on September 25, 2022 for an international trip from Chicago to Cairo and back. After checking the confirmation, I saw that we were assigned to economy class for the Zurich to Cairo flight operated by Swiss (LX238 on Friday, March 10, 2023 departing Zurich at 12:25pm and arriving in Cairo at 5:20pm). When I contacted United, they explained that the booking was a mixed cabin booking

So, I purchased upgraded seats to business class for Flight LX238 directly through Swiss Airlines on January 14, 2023 for $460 per passenger; I have confirmation documents of the upgrade purchases, I was able to pick seats in business class, and have already been charged by Swiss for these upgrades. Since then, I have called Swiss many times to confirm the upgrade, was repeatedly told by Swiss it was confirmed, and the upgrades were reflected on both the Swiss and United Portals. 

I wanted to make sure everything was set for our flights, so I logged into the United Portal on 2/28/23 and saw that the Zurich to Cairo flight was no longer listed on my portal; I checked through the Swiss Portal and saw that the flight was not on that itinerary either. 

I called the Swiss reservations number at 833-626-0737 and spoke to the reservation agent Rose; she said the flight was removed from our itinerary because the flight time changed from Zurich to Cairo, so she reissued the Zurich to Cairo ticket but booked us back into economy class - the flight number, time and aircraft was the same exact as when we purchased the upgrade. When I explained to Rose that I purchased upgrades to business class, she said she could not help us and to contact Swiss technical support. I asked to speak to the manager/supervisor and was told that the supervisor is not available at this time and to call back to speak to a manager and I can instead email customer.relations@swiss.com

I called Swiss technical support at 855-839-4499 and spoke to support team member Zain. He told us he is able to see confirmation of the upgrade purchases but he cannot change the ticket class because this can only be done by a reservation agent. Zain was able to make a note/memo in the reservation regarding the upgrade so that when an agent opened the reservation, they could see the purchase for the upgrade and told me to call the reservation agent again to have them manually associate the upgrade to the ticket. 

I called the Swiss reservation number again, and this time was connected with reservation agent JoJo who told me that United needs to reissue the ticket and upgrade so I would have to contact United. I asked to speak to manager, but was told they are not in. 

I called United and spoke to agent JoAnne, who told me that Swiss did not process the upgrade and left the ticket unsynced. Agent JoAnn from United confirmed all legs of our flights and connected us to Swiss in order to get our upgrade for the Zurich to Cairo flight. 

This time around, we spoke to agent Tamra from Swiss; Tamara told us that she cannot issue the upgrade (from Zurich to Cairo) because the flight from Chicago to Zurich has been changed and we are not confirmed on it, so she sent me back to United.  

I spoke to United agent Mike, who says we are indeed confirmed on UA Flight 3 departing from Chicago at 3:55pm on March 9 and both he and I can see this confirmed on the United Portal and Swiss Portal. He told me that Swiss has to process the upgrade for the Zurich to Cairo flight as this flight is operated by Swiss. 

I called Swiss back again, and spoke to agent Ray. This agent told me that the Zurich to Cairo aircraft was changed so we were booked onto the different aircraft but into economy class, and that in order to upgrade to business class, I would have to pay an additional $540 per passenger. I asked if I could apply the payment I already made of $460 per passenger and pay the difference of $80 per passenger, but she said no. When asked about getting a refund on the original upgrade I purchased, I was told it would cancel our entire trip so I can't request a refund until after the trip is completed. I asked if I could at least choose seats for economy class, and Ray told me I have to pay to pick seats. When I asked to speak to a manager or supervisor, Ray refused to allow me to speak to them saying that the manager cannot help. Ultimately, I paid the fee to pick seats in economy class  --- this was already in addition to the $460 per passenger I paid back on January 14, 2023 for business class. Only after I paid to pick our seats in economy class did Ray say she can now connect me to a manager, put me on a brief hold and then said the manager is not picking up the phone. Looking at this supposed aircraft change - it‚Äôs the same exact aircraft as before. 

The whole reason I purchased business class tickets is because I am 22 weeks pregnant and I wanted to be comfortable and have space given how long the flights are. Had I not checked the portals, we would have not known that the flight was even removed from our itinerary --- what would have happened, were we just expected to land in Zurich and then be told sorry we don't have you booked for the next leg of your journey? Then, when I tried to get my upgrade honored, I was told 4 different things by 4 different Swiss agents, I was not able to get my upgrade honored, and instead had to pay an additional fee on top of the upgrade I already paid for business all to just pick a seat in economy class. You can imagine how extremely frustrating this entire experience has been. 

Obviously there were errors made: flight was removed from our itinerary with out any notification, when I called to ask I was told it was because the ‚Äútime changed‚Äù and was reissued tickets for economy class by your agents instead of business, then was told it was because we were ‚Äúnot confirmed on the original departing flight,‚Äù and then it wad the ‚Äúaircraft changed‚Äù and would have to pay again to purchase a new business class upgrade. None of these errors were on my end - and now I am being left to deal with the issue through no fault of my own, with little or no valuable help from your agents or any reasonable solution. This needs to be fixed.

I also emailed Swiss at the email address I was provided but received a return email ""address not found.""

Well, when United scanned my passport for check-in, I was rejected. The reason being my passport name did not match my ticketed name from Swiss. Swiss ran the salutations into my name making ""Richard"" into ""Richardmrdr"". I called United who said Swiss needed to fix the error, or I would not be issued a boarding pass. I appealed to TSA who told me the ticked name and the passport name must match exactly. ""Richard"" does not match ""Richardmrdr"". United was unable to make the name change because the reservation came from Swiss. Swiss said there should not be a problem...and I quote... ""we will let you on our plane."" Of course, but I have to get through security and United ticketing in Denver, before I can get on your damn plane in Zurich! don't I? After additional hours on the phone with Swiss they determined they simply could not make the change. I would have to go to the Swiss office at the airport, but DIA does not have a Swiss office. The Lufthansa agent at the airport was not at all helpful, in fact he was quite rude. So, the change could not be made by him either. My flight was from DEN  to HRG.

The wines were an absolute budget selection and not a crumb of cheese in sight...quite a miserable offering to be honest.
Food on board...The selection and catering was awful. I actually left my flight hungry on the return sector from Zurich, because I found the food on offer to be sub standard. 
Business class seating on the European sector...this product is no better than economy class, even a premium economy seat would be better.
Having to pay extra for a single seat selection in the business cabin is laughable and with extra seats and rows crammed in the business cabin is overcrowded.

The embassy rep looked at his papers, said ""this is bs"" to each and every page, questioned why he was going, asked him how much money he had (he had to show him credit cards), mocked him when he said the USA visa had been taking 2 years because immigration is running slow, told him there must be some issue, asked him why his checkin bag was 16kg instead of 23kg, then said ""I don't believe your story"" and said ""leave the airport"". My fiance begged him to allow him to produce any document that may convince him like a letter from my USA-based attorney, etc. He said he wasn't interested in talking and that I was not allowed to travel. 

They proceeded to threaten me with banning him from traveling again to any country unless I exited the airport.

THIS IS THE VILEST, DISCRIMINATORY, HORRENDOUS treatment him and I have ever received!!!!!. We are both distraught, crying on the phone, we lost thousands of dollars in bookings and Swiss Airlines says they DON'T TAKE RESPONSIBILITY for it.

While Swiss is more favorite non-U.S. carrier, both flights were awful relative to aircraft and service. A few highlights:

Seats are very uncomfortable. They do not lie flat. Cushions are weak.  Controls are limited and placed near where you easily press one by accident. Storage near or under seats is very limited, hard to find a place for shoes or a purse nearby. 

The SIN-ZRH plane was not very clean and smelled. The other aircraft seemed very new, and was clean, but my seat did not adjust downward as much as my companion; poor construction and quality checking. Washrooms were like in Economy.

Meals and beverages reflected cost-cutting, and I‚Äôve flown Swiss business for decades. Cheap new plastic trays are used, limited refills were offered, galley snacks on these long-flights were popcorn or crisps in small bags and a few small candy bars. Wines and liquors appeared downgraded, as were the menus. Meat was tough, and sides had to elan. Deserts were ordinary. 

Service was abysmal. First meal on a 10 hour flight was served three hours after departure. My companion ordered sherbet from a menu, was given ice cream even though both were on the menu. When asked to exchange, she was told there was no sherbet. I was served 10 minutes  later and received from a different attendant sherbet, and I asked for ice cream. This server told me there was no ice cream. Someone lied orbwasnlazy to care. And two people sitting together in center seats were served a long time apart.

Cabin crew was not friendly, but the ZRH ground crew wins a bad conduct prize. The gate attendant turned to a colleague, rolled her eyes and said softly to her colleague ‚ÄúAmericans‚Äù.",February 2023,"February 20, 2023",1.0,,,,,,,,

Terrible customer service for flight rebooking,Singapore,Zurich,International,"My flight back to Singapore got delayed so I needed to change my flight with Swiss Air from Singapore to Zurich. The website showed $460 for rebooking but did not allow me to proceed. I had to call customer service - took me 12 phone calls on international roaming over 5 hours to change a simple flight. They wanted to charge me 5-6 times the amount quoted and kept hanging up the call. My last call was 55 mins simply to push back the flight by a few hours. Despite telling the staff I‚Äôm on international call, she pit me on hold 15-20 mins at a time, i could hear her chatting and laughing to colleagues when I was on hold (she forgot to put the hold music on). I ended paying nearly $1000 on roaming fee, more than double what the original rebooking fee would have been, and wasted 5 hours as even when they said it has been sorted, no confirmation cane through for me to call back and found out nothing has been booked. I wrote to them afterwards to submit a formal complaint and was told they believe my issue had already been dealt with satisfactorily. Absolutely the worst experience I have ever received. Shame it is a national carrier with no sense of pride not service. I cannot imagine how many people who had had to bear a new flight cost in phone bill for their service (or lack thereof) not mentioning the various attempts to increase pricing any where from $900 to $3000 on rebooking fare difference depending on who I talk to.

Swiss had effectively charged double the original price. At no time was the full and true total displayed on check out.

A quick call to the local Swiss support line confirmed that the price was double and no way they would accept any responsibility nor refund any difference for the tickets.

Terrible after flight service -- missing baby stroller,Copenhagen,Cape Town Central,International,"After departing from Copenhagen we were strangely instructed by the Swiss Air check-in staff to check our baby stroller in the oversized luggage area. This was strange as when we flew to Copenhagen with Lufthansa, we were allowed to check our stroller in as sky check luggage. 
Upon arriving in Cape Town after our trip, we only received the bottom part of our stroller and for some reason the top part had been dismantled and not shipped. We reported this immediately to the baggage claims thinking the part should return within a week or two. It has now been 58 days with no resolution. Multiple emails, phone calls and  automatic bot replies with no concrete information or date of return.

Not anywhere close to expectations,Zurich,New Delhi,International,"One has travelled with Swiss to many destinations in Europe from India in the pre-pandemic times. Their flights used to be marked by the usual and expected Swiss efficiency and quality of service. Unfortunately, however, unless urgent steps are taken by the airline, the same may no longer be true. 

Travelling  from Zurich to Delhi on LX 146 at the end of January 2023 was not the same experience. Many counts of disappointment were present ‚Äî shared by some of the co-passengers whom one spoke to. 

The departure gate itself was a forewarning of the fight. There was mismanagement for visa verification (not sure why that practice has been put into place) with insistence on a stamp-able paper boarding pass. Many (most?) in Europe no longer print a boarding pass but carry one on their mobiles, who were required to rush and get a printed one. Aside from this, one noticed at least 3 instances of queue jumping by some privileged passengers at the instance of the airline staff (that is when separate counters existed for the higher classes of travel!). 

Boarding was the usual confusion but the aircraft was not the expected usual from Swiss. A330-300 deployed on the route was a disappointment, and is desperately in need of upgradation. The seats are cramped and uncomfortable; back support almost non-existent. Even the blanket supplied appeared to be sorely in need of replacement. 

The reappearance of at least a decade-old entertainment system did not inspire feeling of nostalgia but despair. The earphones jack worked only for one ear, no matter how much one tried to make it work and the sound was extremely poor and tinny. The touchscreen was only touch in name and browsing the list of videos was an exercise in patience, besides the display being hazy. The ‚Äòairshow‚Äô was extremely dated and inadequate.

Food was another disappointment ‚Äî none of the things provided were tasty or adequate, be it chicken, mashed potatoes, green beans, rice or the brownie. Each of these items was unpalatable and tasteless. Same goes for the before-landing snack. Only exception was the pre-packed Gruyere cheese! 

The only redeeming feature of the flight was the crew who valiantly tried to make best of a bad situation. However, not being superhuman, all their effort was let down by the management of the airline. 

Swiss does need to answer a simple question: why is one of the busiest routes (and therefore, profitable since all flights are fully booked at a steep price) treated so shabbily?

Great was the fact that you could take 2 suitcases weighing  23 kg each.

My experience was different from most of these reviews,Newark,Dubai,International,"I have to admit I was a bit nervous for this trip after reading the reviews on here, but everything went perfectly, especially for the cost.  I booked flights for my husband and I to fly from Newark, NJ to Dubai with a layover in Zurich each way on United's website and 3 of the 4 legs were on Swiss International. The tickets were less than $600 each round trip,  so 2 tickets were less than one ticket on Emirates or Qatar for the same dates. I've traveled extensively in Switzerland (though usually fly over there from the states on American)  and found the same high level of service and efficiency on Swiss International Airlines that I see in the country. The staff was friendly and helpful, food was delicious and plentiful, seats and the TV were what you would expect for economy. All of our flights were on time and I was nervous about having just over an hour to connect in Zurich on the way over but it was no problem at all- we got to the gate with time to spare.

Then, the seats do not recline. It's like a shell seat thus when your cushion recline, you are pushed forward and your extra legroom is non existent. Whoever designs this type of PE seats obviously has no reality check. 
The seat cushion was thin and it was very uncomfortable. I've flown on PE before with other airlines... Air New Zealand has the best PE seats but awful business class seats. 
Overall, it's better to sit in economy, in the front with extra leg rooms rather than paying for this PE seat which cost more than double of the economy seat.

And if you are a big person, you would have a problem getting in and out of your seat. Just a poor seat layout. If I have to fly with Swiss Air again, I would choose to sit with a stranger, in the middle row, thus I would have aisle access. Bottom line is don't waste your money on these ""Throne"" seats.

Luggage destroyed and no compensation,Valletta,Prague,Europe,"I flew with Swiss Air back in November from Malta to Prague with layover in Zurich.

In Malta I checked-in two bags and when I arrived to Prague I couldn't believe what I saw. One of the luggages was completely destroyed with damage in several sides, missing wheels. You need to treat a luggage with tremendous disregard to break it this way, which Swiss Air managed to do.

First thing I did was taking pictures and sending the information to the airline, asking for compensation of the luggage. Instead of taking care of the issue, Swiss Air redirected the conversation to a third party called ""Dolfi1920"", which I'm still yet to understand who they are. Then, an interrogation started, demanding detailed information about the luggage, specific measures. I told them, I'm on vacation, I don't have a tape to measure and for sure I'm not spending money to buy one, especially since I already had to buy a new luggage. 

After some emails back and forth, they finally move the process and asked for my bank details to proceed with the refund. However, in any moment they specified how much is the compensation, so I can either receive 1 cent or 1 million, it's up to them. This information was received December 2nd saying that I would get my money. In the first email they mentioned that I would get it up to 14 days, however, on a second one they said it would be up to 30 days. Nevertheless, more than 30 days have passed and no sign of the money.

It's pathetic how the airline destroys a luggage and still makes a person feel like they are begging for something they are entitled too.

The fight attendants reassured us all that they had notified our flights that we would be running late. That was a complete lie. We took off running as soon as we got in to our connecting airport because they led us to believe we had hope.

Swiss efficiency is a myth,Oslo,Zurich,Europe,"Swiss air happens to be truly the most appalling airline.

Here is a short summary, and in no way comprehensive, of the ways Swiss air has failed me. I care not for the seats, aircrafts, service or the dumb little chocolates, it is their complete disregard for time that their gravest offence. For a nation that prides itself on their time keeping and obsession with it (one is regularly reminded of their own mortality in Zurich each hour, due the clocks which outnumber residents), they certainly did not get that memo. I have had a flight cancelled at the gate, 5 mins prior to take off. I was refused check in for a flight to the US despite a confirmed esta in hand which was very valid. They have on, not one,  but two occasions charged me twice for a flight which I booked just the one time. They then took close to two months to return the money - on both instances. And now. I am sitting on a plane that is not moving. I arrived at the gate to board. Again, funnily timed (at least they have a sense of humour about time, if they‚Äôre not great at keeping it), they delayed flight right during boarding, citing ‚Äòneeds for staff rest‚Äô. Why? What have they been doing? Are these things not properly scheduled? Should I be terrified to be on this plane?

additional costs because of lack of informatio,Zurich,Chicago,International,"I have always been a loyal fan and guest of Swiss and have always been more than satisfied with their service. Unfortunately, my experience with my last booking to the US clearly clouded my opinion. As always, I booked my flight to Chicago via the Swiss Smartphone App on August 30, 2022 to visit my fianc√©. I wanted to take the opportunity right away to bring our two cats over. I knew that this is easily possible with Swiss and that I simply had to call the hotline after booking to reserve the places for the cats in the luggage compartment. When I received the booking confirmation, I found that the flight was operated by United Airlines, which was unfortunately hardly visible in the app. However, I figured if Swiss partners with United Airlines, the policies and services will be the same. I then called United Airlines to reserve the space for the cats in the luggage compartment. I was quite disappointed to find out that United Airlines no longer takes cats in the luggage compartment. My disappointment was enormous because I had booked a flight that is of no use to me. I then called the Swiss hotline and I had to book a new outbound flight with Swiss with additional rebooking costs of around CHF 270.-. About a week later I call again to make sure the cats are booked and they tell me they are on the Chicago to Zurich flight, which was wrong! After several calls i finally managed it to have them booked on the flight from Zurich to Chicago and not vice versa. The day before departure I went to the pet store to buy a suitable transport box for the cats and called the Swiss Hotline from the shop to make sure I was buying the right transport box. The person on the hotline assured me that soft transport boxes with a steel frame are also permitted for cats. So I chose a model for CHF 120.-. When I checked in the next day at Zurich Airport, I was told that these boxes were not permitted and I had to buy a new one for CHF 140.00 on the spot and had no other choice than trow the other one away. I had additional costs totaling CHF 530 for this trip, which I could have avoided if Swiss had communicated correctly and the informations on the app were more visible. Afterwards I have filed a complaint and i got a short and unpersonal answer back that they can't see anny mistake from their side. Partnerships with other airlines are legitimate, but it must be clearly stated that the policies and services are not the same. every time I called the hotline, I agreed to be recorded, so they should be able to find out about their misinformation, shouldn't they?",October 2022,"December 9, 2022",1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

"Rude, grumpy purser and flight attendants, damaged baggage with no resourse so far",Zurich,Boston,International,"LX 52 from ZRH to BOS on Nov 21 in business class proved to be nightmarish, to say the least. You arrive at the Gate after passport and security controls in order to board, and then get told you have to go somewhere else to have your passport
authenticated once again!That was a joke, because the women stamped our boarding cards, before opening our passports. 
When I tried to discuss this with the purser on board, questioning this unnecessary bureaucracy, his initial glib reply was, ""Well, this happens in the US as well, do you want me to show my passport to prove this to you? I emphasized that this wasn't the passport stamp, but this additional step of stamping boarding cards. His next glib reply was,"" Well now you have your seat!"". I am not sure what he meant by that, but he walked off to grumble to other flight attendants about our conversation. The service went downhill after that, and apart from one younger male flight attendant who was courteous, the ones with seemingly longer tenure were just grumpy right through the flight. If they said anything to you, they made no eye contact, instead angling their faces about 90 degrees away, appearing that they were talking to the air. They only seemed courteous when communicating with some members of a SWISS ski/winter sports team who had been upgraded and seemed to break all rules, including the need to be seated when the flight was about to land, in order to continue conversations with these
sports persons.
Although our bags were stamped priority, the sports team's ski equipment made it out on the carousel much more quickly and when our bags arrived, they were damaged. There were no SWISS reps to take in any complaints on site; in fact, the
same in-flight team (who typically make it to the exit to catch their hotel shuttle) were just hanging out with the sports team, blocking passage for regular flight passengers to leave the airport. When I tried calling the SWISS customer service line to discuss how we could resolve these issues 1 833 626 0727, the line once spontaneously ended, and the second time it was picked up by someone called Belinda from Lufthansa. She was equally surprised as I was, as to how a call to SWISS reached Lufthansa and made some vague comments about calls looping over to Lufthansa if SWISS wasn't available
Finally, I was able to reach a tech support team in South Africa (Tom) who advised how I could fill in an online application. I also attached photos of the damage.
More than two weeks have passed, and I have not received any outreach from SWISS. SWISS is not a low-cost airline, and I think that, for all the discomfort that we endured, their customer service could be a lot better.",November 2022,"December 1, 2022",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,1.0

I re-checked my booking 3 weeks before my trip to add one more luggage. Guess what, I have no luggage booked. so I tried booking online, if I say almost impossible. would you Believe me? yea, I ended up up calling swiss air international. the service personell on the other side (mumbling) tells me I can only book luggage from Stockholm, to Bryssels. I have to book from Bryssels to Uganda and pay the fantastic sum of (65 EURx2 1500 kr) and Bryssels -Stockholm 85 EURx 1700"") total price for luggage 3200 kr my ticket Stockholm- Uganda cost 8000 kr because I booked so early, but it seems the end price will be 11200 kr or more..  would in fact not go on the trip.. I will re-book my ticket, pay almost the same amount and it will coast 11200 kr. 
So I decided to spend 2 days in Doha including hotel. 
So, Before you book your ticket by using swissair booking services on line,  remember, if you have to change flight.

Not even the shadow of Swissair...... low value for money,Bangkok,Zurich,International,"I've flown Swissair, and then Swiss since my childhood. Although they aren't the same company, it seems to they no longer even have the Swiss service edge either (could it be the German ownership?). Flying back from Asia in Business after a months of low cost airlines around the region should have felt like pure bliss. It wasn't much of a step up.

Half the staff were friendly and helpful, the other half seemed to have checked in their smiles with their luggage. After being spoken to in German (which I don't understand) 3 times by the same stewardess, she finally used English (although I had spoken to her in French) - looking exasperated.

The seats were narrow - my shoulders were compressed by the edges when in the ""bed"" position and although I'm not small, I'm by no means the biggest person out there. The seat itself was rather hard, not much more comfortable than some of the low-cost options we'd flown in the previous few weeks.

The entertainment selection was haphazard heavily leaning towards movies more than 20yrs old and didn't change between our flight to Asia mid October and return one month later.

The food was really not impressive. The vegetarian dish my wife had was tasteless, and the beef I had was chewy. The ""selection of Swiss and International Cheese"" (see  menu picture) was 1 small slice of mass production swiss hard cheese, and 1 small slice of mass produced french soft cheese. On the 11.5h flight there was only 1 meal served, however there was the option to order a few ""Bistrot"" items for those who were hungry. What we didn't know was that you could only order 1 of these items - which we found out 2h before landing when we asked for a burger (which came with the smallest excuse for a leaf of lettuce I have ever seen) after having had the pomelo salad (see pictures) - which was refused.

Paying a full-fare business class ticket on Swiss was clearly a bad idea, money would have been much better spent on a 5-star hotel the night before flying and a limousine drive home from the airport.

Mixed - but mostly good - bag,Lisbon,Zurich,Europe,"First things first: it does seem like Swiss has had a drop in quality of their service. Growing up I flew with them a lot and they were synonymous with quality, even for their Economy customers.

One big blow to their quality and reputation is their choice to partner with some questionable companies, like TAP Air Portugal - which has a deservedly terrible reputation. In codeshare flights, this causes a lot of trouble for their customers - which happened to my parents this weekend.

The Lisbon-Zurich leg of their flight was cancelled last minute by TAP, and then we all spent 24 hours chasing everybody and their sister's dog up to get a resolution as they were stranded in Lisbon. Both at their desks at the airport and on their helplines, one kept passing us to the other, neither actually doing something to help two over-60s get out of a foreign country they were stranded in!

In what we found a shocking move for Swiss, they hung up on us several times, and also didn't seem to make any notes on our case - meaning we had to do the whole spiel from the top every time we called back.

Finally, we got a hold of a fantastic customer service agent called Tony, who actually stayed on the line for an entire hour, and managed to find my parents tickets for the next day - hurray! He saved us from endless circles ad infinitum, and truly did his job description justice. 

The other agents, while polite, didn't seem all too bothered, and put us on hold - at which point the call disconnected every time. 

So, tentatively 4 stars because I do think Swiss/Lufthansa overall is still a good company, but that's mainly based on Tony saving us from endless trouble. In addition, in my own flight a couple of months ago, they were punctual, polite and helpful - I couldn't walk due to an accident, and was taken great care of.

 Minus points for their insistence on working with that blasted TAP, though. Please rethink whom you do business with - you *are* partially responsible for the terrible treatment your customers get from your partners.",November 2022,"November 6, 2022",4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0
Delayed Baggage,Athens,Newark,International,"Our Swiss flight was from Athens - Zurich - Newark with a 50 min layover at Zurich airport. Me and my husband each had 1 personal item and 1 carry on as per the airline regulations.  Also, we were aware that there has been baggage chaos since the summer due to lack of staff etc. etc and hence we decided to travel light. Absolutely NO CHECK-IN baggage, only so that we dont have to wait for our luggage or any issues with lost bag etc.  At Athens Airport, the airline staff looking at our personal item requested us to check-in our small carry on items saying the flight is full and there wont be space for our bags.  My husband explained to them that hes a Star-Alliance Gold Member and we are boarding Group 1 and we would not like to check-in our bags.  Also, very politely he told them that we have a short international connection to Newark, USA and the bag will not rch Newark airport.  We dont want to go thru the hassle of complain n then wait for the bag.  To this, the airline staff were rude in saying ""Doesnt Matter, you have to check-in your baggage"".  While this was happening, we saw many other passengers with similar or bigger bags in Group 3,4 or 5 having no issues.  Finally my husband agreed and sent his bag for check-in and they put a ""PRIORITY"" tag on the baggage. They insisted on putting my bag (7.8kgs and absolutely fitting into the carry-on baggage regulations) also into check-in which me n my husband strongly refused.  Now with all this our fears came true.  We landed at Newark airport with no sign of our bag and no Swiss representative or counter in sight. Finally found a lady with some pamphlet saying we need to complain online on some Lufthansa website for the lost baggage.  This is exactly what we were fearing and though we had put in all our efforts so that we dont have to be a part of this luggage chaos, we are now a part of it.   Thanks to the rude airline staff who, in the last moment, converted our carry-on baggage to check-in baggage and lost our bag.

Don't fly with them if you are flying with a pet,Miami,Zurich,International,"BE AWARE!!!! This was my worst experience flying cross Atlantic in my 25 years flying Europe-USA. The customer service was already problematic after booking my flight. I had extra bags that I had to pay for which I had no problem. I called customer service on 1-800... number to book extra bags and to pay for them. They took my credit card information but I did not receive payment confirmation and my credit card was not charged. I was calling for 3 weeks trying to pay and always the same problem. A day before my departure I called again and all the customer service representative was able to do was to confirm the number of extra bags. He told me to pay for the extra bags at the airport where the cost was $120 higher for 3 bags than if I paid over the phone which I was trying for 3 weeks.
The worst experience happened during the flight. I flew with my 5.2 lbs dog. I prepared myself with the right size of bag for my dog, read all the instructions and requirements on swissair.com which said basically that the bag with the pet had to be stored under the seat during take-off, landing and turbulences. I followed the instructions I read but very rude stewardesses on the flight who informed me that the bag had to be stored under the seat the whole flight in very reprimanding way after they saw the bag in my lap. My dog is not barking or crying as long as she is with me. She caused no disturbance in any way yet the stewardesses were reprimanding me all the time and even had me changed the seats. When I could not tolerate their rudeness I asked to be upgraded which I wanted to pay for and I was refused of that as well. It was the worst customer service you could imagine which I had to deal with for 9 hours. I will not fly with Swiss Air ever again. When I complained about their customer service and requested to be refunded for the extra charge for the bags they told me there was nothing they would pay me back. They even didn't apologise for the staff being so rude during the flight. If you can, avoid them.",September 2022,"November 2, 2022",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,2.0
Being ripped off,Canton of Geneva,London,Europe,"In September this 2022 purchased a return ticket from London Heathrow to Geneva. My wife who has vascular dementia  was due to go into a respite home the day before my departure,  whilst I was traveling for my 80th birthday with my family in Geneva.
However a problem arised with my wife's move and I had to alter the date of departure. when I tried to do this online myself, there was an administration fee on top of the new flight cast of ¬£70 Which in itself is sheer roberry as I am the one who spent the time online to arrange for this change therefore costing nothing to Swiss as administration.  I found another flight from Swiss departing on the day i needed for ¬£114 and I decided to take this flight and not bother to use the ongoing part of the return flight paid for and avoid the ¬£70 ""administration fee"". No problem so far and flew to Geneva and expected to use the return part of my original ticket to return to London at THE DATE AND TIME of my ticket.
However, to my great surprise, when I went to collect my boarding pass for my return flight, I was told that because I did not take the ongoing flight the return one was automatically cancelled and would therefor have to purchase another ticket at a cost of over ¬£400 (450swiss francs). As I had no choice and no access to the internet to try to find another flight with Easyjet on that day I had to purchase this ticket at that price. It appears this is quite normal to lose the return part of a ticket if you do not use the ongoing part. I have since tried to find Where that information was on the ticket conditions and found nothing to indicate this. I therefore consider that Swiss has breach a contract as I did not make any change to my ticket other than not taking the initial flight.
I am Swiss and leave in England and thought I would try to fly with Swiss to support my national airline.

Once was okay,Miami,Zurich,International,"We flew on Swiss from MIA to ZRH. We were expecting the worst from having read so many of these reviews. Our problem is very small compared to what others have expressed. The flight from Miami was 45 minutes late, yet we arrived 20 minutes early in Zurich. Same on the return. Very good pilots! They know how to make up time. 

We booked premium economy seats and had boarding group 3. The ground crew at MIA set up 4 lines and group 3 was mixed with group 4. On AA with PE seats we get to board right after business class. The crew at Zurich airport was even worse. The ground crew called everyone in economy. No lines formed, just push your way to the front. You would think the plane was going to take off without these people that they were so desperate to get on. It was ridiculous. Very disorganized. 

The PE seats were not comfortable at all. This new idea of having the seat slide down was horrible. You could see a lot of people having a problem with it and finally gave up. I didn't even try. The seats were hard with no cushion whatsoever. The selection on the tv's was not good at all. The music options were even worse.

The flight attendants were nice. They did not come around for quite a while after meals were served. But after reading so many of their reviews, I guess that's what they're being trained to do.

We liked the food and the drink options. No problem there. The chocolates that were handed out were delicious. 

Overall we had a good experience, but we don't plan to fly with Swiss again, we prefer to pay for PE seats and fly on AA next time.",October 2022,"October 28, 2022",3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,1.0,4.0

The seats I paid extra to reserve had other passengers already sitting there and we were told to wait in the back until boarding is complete to find us seats.  The seats in economy are the most uncomfortable I have ever experienced.  It felt like sitting on a bench for 10 hours.  Also they are not sturdy as the passenger in front's movement in front while the seat was reclined kept the seat bouncing onto us.  The meal options were limited to vegetarian as meat ran out quick.

"Flight Canceled, Confused and Dazed",Boston,Zurich,International,"Our flight was canceled from Boston to Zurich on our trip to Prague. We were informed only after the gate agents noticed passengers looking and pointing at the info board. They had started boarding families with children and called for no other passenger classes. We were all directed back to the service counter. 

There we were told they would try to get hotels but that we were on our own for rebooking the flight and any connecting flights. I was upset as we were traveling with our daughter's pup. I had no idea if there would be room for her. It turned out our flight was rebooked automatically and I was notified by email. I didn't check my emails as I was told we had to rebook ourselves. 

By that time I was waiting to speak to an agent about the dog. She offered to rebook for me. Get this. She couldn't see that ourflight was already booked for 10/19 and booked us on 10/20. She was pleasant considering the circumstances. When I checked email at home I saw the 10/19 flight. I called Customer Service and was told the flight was 10/19. I checked the app to check in and it listed 10/20. A call on the morning of 10/19 made it clear we weren't leaving until 10/20 and I couldn't rebook my return until I got to the airport. I couldn't even get seats assigned!!

I am not happy. I'm furious. This was poorly handled. When the gate agents found out flights had been rebooked automatically they should have sent one of them down to let passengers know and to hang tight.

It‚Äôs appalling how you still have clients being so incompetent. The LEAST you must do is to pay our taxi transfer and food expenses ‚Äî but it does not include our stress, anxiety, and energy wasted. My friend has asthma and suffers from panic attacks and vertigo so it was VERY traumatic for her having to rush so much in order to catch an impossible connection. It all started from 2021:

- Countless hours wasted waiting to speak with agent over the phone to be often disconnected 
- Cancelled flight without previous warnings and after speaking with agent and confirming the new flight details
- Provided much higher fees for re rescheduling the cancelled flight
- Charged the wrong credit card
- Changed flight connection from GRU to CWB and refused to acknowledge flight choice over email
- Called to choose 07:30 option but agent said that the 07:15 had already been chosen, which we didn‚Äôt manage to arrive at the gate on time to catch it, of course!
- Agent at Zurich airport gave wrong information saying that we wouldn‚Äôt need to get our suitcases at GRU, but only in CWB
- Had to pay R$206 for a taxi from GRU to CGH  for taking an earlier flight connection at 12pm otherwise we would have to wait until 15:40.
- Agents kept trying to weight and check in my hand luggage despite it being within the allowed weight and dimensions
- My friend booked return flight and the connection was 2h apart leaving from different airports. When she called to change the flight after realising that they were not leaving from the same airport, the agent mocked her saying that Swiss wouldn‚Äôt have given this option if it wasn‚Äôt manageable ‚Äî note: just to transfer from CGH to GRU takes around 1h30min by cab  ‚Äî and not only did she have to pay a fee for canceling the impossible flight, but also had to pay an extra free for rebooking one leaving from GRU!

They came around several times with water and had bottles at the rear galley. We got up a few times and went back to get water and soda.

The lavatory was clean and had nice hand lotion and face mist spray. Don't see that on domestic carriers. 

 The entertainment was good but I found the screens and interface a bit slow and old compared to other economy flights I have been on.  The 2-pin headphone interface.  All in all it was a pretty easy flight with no hassles and good service for what we were in.

Flying first class and being treated with rudeness and incompetence,Zurich,Los Angeles,International,"My flight on Oct 5th was a nightmare from beginning to end.  At Lisbon airport I waited 1 hour for the Swiss counter to open with several other people.  Not a representative around for any information.  Finally someone wen downstairs and found that the checkin was with TAP a coshare with Swiss.  This was not on my booking and I would have missed the flight if Someone had not gone downstairs to check.  The flight to Zurich was delayed and the nice crew on TAP sent notice that I would be late with very little time to make my connection to LAX.  There was no one at the gate when I arrived, and I had to run a very long way to the tram which goes to Gates E with a broken kneecap.  I then had another excruciating long run to gate E26 where I saw the plane had not departed.  I was met with rude unsmiling gate agents who behaved as if it was my fault that their plane was delayed from Lisbon.  The agent refused to let me board saying that she had no booking for me on the flight!  She insisted that I was booked on Lufthansa the day before and she couldn't do anything.  I was in tears by then and she kept searching and at one point told me not to bother her.  I managed to pull up my booking on my iPhone and only then did she manage to find that I was indeed booked on the flight.  The Lufthansa booking was an old booking of more than a month!  I managed not to yell or cause a scene as I was sure they would not allow me to board.  No apology from this person and absolutely sour faces from all 3 agents.

Very bad airline,Zurich,Mumbai,International,"Good afternoon.
As an experienced traveler, flying across continents with diverse flight companies (KLM, Air France, Emirates etc.) I can only be highly disappointed by the travel quality with Swiss. Hereby a list of reasons for my complaint:

1. In spite of it not being priorly communicated, a face mask was required on the flight, which I can understand if it's a country requirement, but how inconsiderate having a flight attendant distributing face masks with no gloves and her finger directly placed on the part of the mask that is placed on the mouth and nose. This is a very improper use of the face mask.

2. The pillows and blankets found on the flight were unpacked and unsealed, which leads me to the very strong believe that they were not fresh. This is disgusting and hygienically hazardous.

3. On an 8 hours flight (departing at 1PM) only one meal provided and a small snack is absolutely insufficient. People were hungry on board.

3. A design flow of my folding table made impossible for me to put the tray or any class without it directly slipping towards my legs.

4. The entertainment screens were CONSTANTLY lagging and getting stuck, making it impossible to watch anything.

5. The very much advertised wifi on board never worked on this flight.

6. The airplane seats are the narrowest economy seats of all companies I've ever flew with.",October 2022,"October 8, 2022",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0

They deserve 0 stars. THE WORST!,Los Angeles,Zurich,International,"I don't even know where to begin with the nightmare that is Swiss Air / Lufthansa.

No one informed me when I booked wheelchair assistance for my mom at the time of booking our ticket, that she could not sit in the row with extra legroom AND receive wheelchair assistance through the airport. The Swiss Air employees at LAX REFUSED her wheelchair assistance, so my 82 year old mom who had back surgery earlier this year, had to WALK all the way through LAX to our gate. Despicable!! 

Swiss Air sent me 3 emails during our trip, changing our seats each time, due to ""equipment changes."" We purchased our tickets 3 months in advance, in order to ensure that we had one aisle and one window seat with extra legroom for each flight, due to her history of blood clots in the legs. And without any thought, they removed us from our seats and stuck us in middle seats with no legroom. 

I spent approximately 3+ hours on the phone, of which I was disconnected 5 times (yes, FIVE TIMES). Swiss Air told me they could NOT help me with my seats and that I would have to deal with Lufthansa. I called Lufthansa and they said they would NOT help me because I purchased the tickets on Swiss Air so I would have to deal with Swiss Air. A continuous loop of BS and unaccountability. NO ONE would help us with our ever-changing seat assignments. We even asked if we could change flights for our return back to LAX, and they said the fare difference would be $1350 PER TICKET.

The day before our return flight back to Los Angeles, we received yet another email stating that my mom had NO SEAT on the flight, AT ALL. When I called, I was subjected to one RUDE Swiss Air rep after another, all saying ""sorry for the inconvenience, but there is nothing they can do"" and that we would have to wait until we got to the airport in Milan. Swiss Air ALSO said that extra legroom fees are NONREFUNDABLE and they would NOT be able to refund the money from the seats that we originally purchased and were REPEATEDLY STOLEN from us. 

So let me get this straight. We paid WAYYYY too much money in the first place to purchase our original tickets 3 months in advance on through Swiss Air's website, paying extra for each segment in order to have extra legroom. Then Swiss Air changes our seat assignments 3 times, each time to a middle seat with NO EXTRA LEGROOM. Then you take my mom's seat away ENTIRELY ANDDDDD you tell us that we will not be able to get a refund for the extra legroom seat that we purchased. And to top it off, Swiss Air tells us we HAVE to go through Lufthansa and Lufthansa tells us we HAVE to go through Swiss Air. 

I was so disgusted with both Swiss Air AND Lufthansa (who owns Swiss Air) that we finally gave up and purchased one-way tickets home on Emirates Air, which was the airlines we SHOULD have flown to begin with. I will NEVER, and I mean NEVER fly Lufthansa or Swiss Air EVER again.

What they did is CRIMINAL and no one gives a you know what. We have no recourse, no where to go. Just a lot of lost money. They stole my precious vacation time and caused me an INCREDIBLE amount of stress and anguish, NOT TO MENTION, REFUSING TO PROVIDE WHEELCHAIR ASSISTANCE FOR MY ELDERLY MOBILITY-IMPAIRED MOTHER.

They don‚Äôt pay attention to the meal preparation. Though you can choose one main course from 3 , but many guests on the bottom  rows got no choice but can only choose the left ones. Poor preparation and prediction about meal selection.

Travel complaint,Copenhagen,Zurich,Europe,"Of the 60+ different airline carriers I have flown over the years of travelling, Swiss was the worst - and that is to say there is a lot of competition for worst experience including Royal Nepal airlines who at one point had all planes (4 total) grounded in foreign countries while awaiting a technician to come from Brunei to service them.    My family (4 of us) travelled from Copenhagen to Zurich and all 5 bags were lost, 4 for 1 week and 1 bag for 5 weeks.  In addition, our car seats for our young children were lost - Swiss was unable or unwilling to provide replacement seats at the Zurich airport and we had to travel with the children without seatbelts from the airport - against Swiss law.   Swiss was the last carrier we took -a claim was filed on July 5 and six email exchanges later, we still have not received our compensation.  At first Swiss denied it was there responsibility, then subsequently has been giving us the run around - wait several weeks before responding,  then ask a question that they already previously asked us.  Our only resort was to file a claim with our home country transportation authority - as Swiss was clearly in violation of the Montreal convention.  It is still astonishing how poorly they have handled this.    I would highly discourage anyone from taking this airline - especially with children and certainly if there is any expectation with decent customer service.",June 2022,"October 5, 2022",1.0,,,,1.0,1.0,,,1.0

Customer service when baggage was missing was poor,Singapore,London,International,"The flight itself was pretty good. Service was average but the airplanes were clean and looked relatively new. 

The issue I had was with the customer service when my baggage was missing in London City Airport. My suitcase had not arrived when I landed and I had to fill in a form and was then given a piece of paper with information such as a link to track my baggage, the reference number and a contact number. 

However, when I called the contact number provided, I was told that was not the right number and to call a different number (note that this happened multiple times and almost every time, the person I spoke to gave me a new different number to call). Note most of these different numbers didn‚Äôt help eg. one person said it was Lufthansa only, someone else said they were not baggage-related, someone said to call the airport, someone gave me yet another number. The link to track the baggage just has 3 options - whether the bag has been located, receipt of bag at the airport, delivery/collection. Hence, you don‚Äôt get given any idea of exactly where your bag is or how long it might potentially take for it to arrive at your destination airport. 

The only Swiss Air person I spoke to on the phone who was able to give me an actual response (rather than telling me to contact a different number) just told me that it i s still being located and I should just wait. When we called Singapore Airport, they were thankfully able to tell us right away exactly which flight it was on and when it would arrive in London. 

Why was this made so complicated by Swiss Air and why were they not able to share this with us? Surely a lot of distress could have been avoided by providing the information. I have also had to spend a lot of money to travel to and fro from the airport twice more (once to check about the suitcase as my calls were not helping me understand where my suitcase was and once to get my suitcase myself when it arrived as the staff at London City airport said it would take another 1-2 days for them to send it to me otherwise). The service has really been very disappointing and it would be great if you can provide greater support to customers in future if someone‚Äôs baggage has gone missing. My suitcase did arrive on the same day so I truly appreciate that it was all resolved relatively quickly (and I did get an email 2 hours after the flight with my bag arrived at the airport) but the issue was just that it was really hard finding someone who was able to assure me that they would find the bag and also let me know when I was likely to receive it.",October 2022,"October 4, 2022",1.0,,,,,,,,

They even admitted that I was provided wrong information but said 'the operator has been disciplined, however we will not give you any more of your money back'. They ignored emails, letters and phone calls. Did not care. I spoke to friends and this seems to be a common occurrence with Swiss Arline's. I had wrong info given by Easyjet in the past and received a voucher instantly.

I called and they were no help.

Awful experience and I'm so glad the other legs of our flights is United. I will never fly Swiss again and I haven't even gotten to the airport. Watch our flight get cancelled with no recourse now - knock on wood. 

If you were a great airline, you would make it right with each of your customers. Instead, it's just, ""oh well, deal with it"" and I expected so much more from a European airline. We're from America and we're supposed to be the ones with the terrible customer service horror stories. Get your website updated to the 23rd century because it's like you're in 1990.

Disgusting  booking payment system and lying customer service operatives,London,Male,International,"We fly as a family of 4 in Business Class 3-4 times a year and on this occasion we reserved flights for the first time with Swiss Air. I then attempted to confirm and pay for the flights and after using 3 different Credit Cards and their Direct pay system, all of which authorized but failed to complete on Swiss Airs online system, I resorted to calling Customer Service.

The agent could see our booking and our attempts to complete the transaction but had no explanation as to why the transaction would not complete. He advised that he could not resolve the issue and that he had passed it to another department and they would resolve the issue and respond to me within 24-48 hours. 

I asked for an email confirming the situation but was advised all the notes were on the system against the booking reference and they could not send emails. At no point did the agent offer to take payment and so I assumed their payment system was actually down.

I subsequently received an automated email advising that my booking had expired and was cancelled. We therefore called Customer Service again and questioned why was happening and were told there were no notes on the system but they would reinstate the booking for us. They put us on hold and then cut us off.

When we called back again they then said they could not reinstate the booking and we would have to book again and it would be ¬£ 4000.00 more than our original booking. We asked to speak to a supervisor or manager repeatedly but were told none were available. We had to ask 5 times for an email address to submit a complaint.

We then asked them for our ¬£ 27.00 reservation fee to be refunded and after a 10 minute wait we were told that they could not refund it as we did not complete the booking.

It has become obvious during the course of the numerous telephone calls that their Customer Service is a joke. They have lied repeatedly and ripped us off for the reservation fee.

Ultimately it is their loss and seeing the other negative reviews it is obvious we are not the only ones suffering issues. In the end it is a blessing and we have booked with Gulf Air who we have flown with before and who were excellent is all respects.",September 2022,"September 3, 2022",1.0,,,,,,,,

Most cramped and unpleasant experience ever! Never again!,Los Angeles,Zurich,International,"Flying economy on Swiss Air's Boeing B777 300ER was the worst experience I've ever had in decades of flying. 

This new plane was designed to maximize the number of people that can be crammed in economy. Shockingly, for a newly designed plane, it's missing or falls far short on a number of things including:

- Seats have very little legroom, the least of any flight I've been on

- Table trays are very small about half the size of other planes I've been on

- You cannot eat or use the tray very well if the person in front of you reclines. The airline attendants had to tell people not to recline during mealtime. 

- The aisles are more narrow than other airplanes. Rolling a standard sized carryon down the aisles is difficult due to it constantly hitting the side of seats next to the aisle

- This is shocking: carryon bags that meet Swiss Air's size limitation will NOT fit in the overhead bins unless they are turned sideways! Thus, instead of fitting 3 carryon suitcases in each bin, if placed bottom end towards the back and top end towards the front, only 1 carryon suitcase can fit (sideways) along with jackets and smaller duffle-type carryon bags. I helped the attendant arrange bags in a couple of bins by standing on a seat to squeeze in bags together. This is a perplexing shortcoming of the 777 since there is more than enough space for the airplane to have larger bins for luggage.

- Bin space runs out fast.  At least ten people in our section of the plane did not find space for their carryon bags. They had to have them taken by the flight attendant as checked-in luggage. I don't know if their luggage arrived when they did in Zurich.

- There are no air nozzles above the seats to aim air or adjust airflow. The cabin was kept warm, too warm for me. Air nozzles would allow each passenger some opportunity to customize the environment for their comfort. Many missed having air nozzles, especially before take-off when the air is not flowing well throughout the cabin.

 - The seats are difficult to recline. The bottom of the seat moves forward while the back reclines. It takes great effort to scoot your butt forward while moving your back rearward. Some passengers needed the flight attendant to push back on the seatback while the passenger scooted their bottoms forward. 

I felt sorry for the flight attendants who had to spend their time finding bin space for bags, checking in carryon suitcases when there was no more room in the bins, telling passengers to not recline during mealtime, and helping passengers move their difficult-to-recline seats backwards.

Here's the positive:
+ The flight attendants were friendly, helpful, and effective in doing their variety of responsibilities. 

+ Every seat had a small blanket sealed in a plastic bag, an unpackaged pillow, and ear buds.

+ The food wasn't great, but not too bad for airline food. 

+ The flight attendants came by often offering a variety of drink options

+ There was 1 USB-A outlet under the entertainment screen for charging. You'll need to bring your own charging cable.

Overall, this was the most uncomfortable flight I've been on mainly due to the cramped seats, tiny tray, and no air nozzles. Add this to limited bin space and narrow aisles ensures that I won't be flying Swiss Air again.",August 2022,"September 2, 2022",2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0

Avoid this airline at all cost,Singapore,Krakow,International,"1) Swiss have bad IT system that lost my transaction and recorded my transaction wrongly. For a flight that I booked on Swiss website for a Swiss-operated flight, they told me that I was actually booked on their partner's codeshare flight (United Airlines) which will be operated by Swiss. A load of crap. 

2) Horrible customer service - I got hung up on, I got shouted at, I got blamed for doing the transaction over their website instead of calling in, I was given many versions of wrong information by different agents.

3) Customer Service lied - On my different calls, they told me different things. One told me that all is set and not to worry. Then the next will tell me it was not ticketed in time and it couldn't have been confirmed. Then the next tells me it's now confirmed. And the next tells me it was sitting with their ticketing department for 2 weeks so it's not confirmed. 

4) Customer Service is not anywhere near Europe, so you won't be able to get fast response - As confirmed over a few phone calls, they are based in the South Pacific Islands, if i'm not wrong, Fiji. The timezone is different from Switzerland, or even South Asia if their IT system is even base there (i'm not sure), so getting help or calling the relevant department will not be possible, so you can only keep waiting.

We filed a claim at Naples airport and with Swiss Airlines via their lost luggage tracker.  We were told to check back at Naples airport in 2 days. We returned to the airport after 2 days and no baggage. We filed a claim for reimbursement to buy clothes and toiletries as posted on their website they reimburse $100 per day. We did not receive any reimbursement for cost despite submitting all our receipts. We returned to the United States on June 26, 2022 without any update. Then, we received an email stating that our baggage could not be located and to submit a claim for baggage content reimbursement. It‚Äôs been 3 months and no baggage or reimbursement for the lost baggage and it‚Äôs contents.  We attempted to contact the Serv√≠ce Center numerous times.

I was traveling from Italy to the USA to attend my mother‚Äôs funeral. I am disabled and had also injured my knee and was on crutches and requested wheel chair assistance. I had made the reservations under  difficult conditions due to the death in my family but  I did make sure my service dog was on the reservation. I asked to booking code and was told there was none. When I arrived in Palermo I was told m service dog was not in the system. I had to wait over two hours and barely  got on the flight and had to PAY to hav e my dog on board which is agains federal law.

This was the tone fro the entire transatlantic flight.  All the flight attendants were deep offended  and down right offensive because  dared to  bring my service dog on board! When the disabled group I was with arrived in Zurich no wheel chairs were provided and we were hustled along through the airport most of us barely able to walk.

Worst Air travel experience in 40+ years of traveling!,Zurich,Chicago,International,"Swiss International Airlines is the absolute worst airline travel experience that I have had in 40+ years of air travel and I will permanently avoid them!

August 12, 2022, on flight LX006 (ZRH to ORD) a 10-hour flight‚Ä¶We found the gate agent to be very rude when asked about checked luggage and this attitude seemed to be reflected in the dismissive manner in which the flight crew interacted with passengers. We were seated in the first row (row 22) just behind the bulkhead dividing business class. During the entire 10-hour flight the flight attendants made ‚Äúappearances‚Äù LESS than 4 times. 

‚Ä¢	We left the gate at Zurich at 9:30 AM local time.

‚Ä¢	Within 1 hour of takeoff to provide and initial beverage (only a small cup, would not leave a full soda); then 

‚Ä¢	2.5 hours after takeoff back to serve ‚Äúlunch‚Äù although they failed to serve my wife any meal. Assuming that they may have been serving ‚Äúspecial‚Äù meals first, we patiently waited. After 30 minutes and in looking around seeing all other passengers had been served, I pressed the flight attendant ‚Äúcall button‚Äù and it remained on for no less than 45 minutes without any sort of response! I turned it off after this time as it was clear I was not important. It was TWO HOURS after our neighboring passengers had been served, two flight attendants showed up to clear away the meal trays which by now littered the cabin floors and other areas as passengers had gotten frustrated with having no outlet for their trays and garbage. (See photos).
o	Once the flight attendants returned, I asked, ‚ÄúWhen will WE receive our meals????‚Äù and was told they didn‚Äôt have anything available, but they would check‚Ä¶he returned with two vegan meals.

‚Ä¢	6 hours into the flight the flight attendant returned to finally clear OUR meal trays and offer another cup full of soda or water.

‚Ä¢	8 hours into the flight was the last time we experienced the flight attendant where they handed out a silver dollar sized ‚Äúbreakfast pizza‚Äù and a US Customs form (with no pen‚Ä¶was told to borrow one from ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù around us).

Customer Service Is Horrible,Zurich,Malaga,Europe,"Swiss Airlines was once a reputable airline that I highly recommended to my clients, friends, and family.  Unfortunately, they have fallen far from their once prestigious levels of great Customer Service. 
Upon losing our luggage, the airlines took 3 days to deliver our lost luggage to our accommodations.  Upon receiving the luggage, one of them was severely damaged that it was beyond use.  (see photos attached)  I immediately reported the damage claim to the airlines and was provided with an automated response of ""...please be patient"".  A week later, I followed up via phone and email and was again told that they are too busy so I would need to still wait.  It has now been 3 weeks since the damage was reported and there is still no response.  From reading the Customer feedback on Twitter, Facebook, TripAdvisor, etc., many other clients are experiencing the same issues.   
On the Swiss Air website, I followed their online claim of damaged baggage.  It lead us to a 3rd Party website called Dolfi 1920.  Upon reporting our claim, we were given a credit of 63 euros for a suitcase that was less than a year old and we had paid nearly 100 euros when purchasing it.  The problem is that the credit must be used on Dolfi 1920's website and if anyone looks for themselves at this website, ALL luggage on this site is extremely overpriced.  I would not be surprised if Swiss Airlines is involved with this scheme in which to drive more profits for themselves.  
What makes matters worse is that I had paid a nearly $900 upgrade to these flights and this still happened.  To the date of this review, I have yet to hear back from any representative from Swiss Airlines.  I have requested to speak to their Management Team or Corporate Team to escalate the situation, but I have still not heard back.

Family unfriendly & awful customer service,Amsterdam,Johannesburg,International,"Plusses: our flights did not get cancelled. Legspace is OK. The chocolates are nice.

Negatives:
1. Customer service takes at least 0,5 hours to reach. Bad language skills, I've tried the Dutch speaking centre as well as the English speaking, so it was very hard to change seats (online doesn't work with baby <8 months). They emailed me an ""urgent request to call back"" without calling themselves, so I had to wait another 45 min to get to speak to someone. 
2. No guarantee that kids are next to their parents, unless you buy seats. As I was unable to check in early myself (to make sure the seating works) so I paid.
3. Bassinet for baby is free, but comes only with chair for 1 family member. Additional seats in the row were CHF140,-/chair. I understand these are nice seats, but with Alitalia this was free to all sit together (in the past?). 
4. The software to change seats is very buggy. I changed seats during check-in, but got my old seats in the confirmation. 
5. No meal choice. Twice they had beef only. I don't like beef. 
6. A large part of the time your personal screen shows commercials. 
7. Stopover times AMS - ZRH - JNB are too short with small kids. Both times we had to run & carry our baby, handluggage & 3 yo (bus, train, security check, passport check all squeezed in 1:20 hour, leaves no time for toilet or coffee). We got priority boarding, but we felt great we made it in time both times as one of the last people to board.
8. Maxi cosi on the way back didn't make it. I hope we see it again. 
9. Staff on flight & check-in at JNB is not very friendly.

Stairs is impossible For Him without handrails and is very difficult with them. Despite having requested assistance before the trip, Swiss Air was not prepared to help us.

As time for our flight approached, and no one came it was suggested that we try to make it to the gate by ourselves. Luckily, our son was able to help us eventually and we got to the gate right before boarding. We were last to get on the plane and my husband had to pull himself up 15 stairs to board.

Overbooking flights (and then looking for excuses to kick you off)!,New York City,Tel Aviv,International,"We are a family who recently flew on a connecting flight from New York to Tel Aviv, with a stopover in Zurich. However, instead of continuing straight to Tel Aviv, the airline asked us for an entry form to Israel (Covid regulations), even though they knew that we can enter Israel without it, as we are Israeli citizens (to be sure, they could've done so in NY, before boarding, and they didn't do that). In addition, they didn't allow us to fill out the form on the spot (a process that takes around 30 seconds per person). Instead, they gave us a flight for 36 hours later! And when we finally enbarked that plane, they didn't even ask for that stupid form!!...

So we ended up staying at the Zurich airport - without our luggages, without fresh clothing and without formula for the baby. We were told by one Swiss employee that they were overbooking flights at the time (close to 20 more than the capacity!) - which explains why they were eager to kick us off the plane, since we were a big family with many kids. 

Finally, when boarding the plane from Zurich, they took away our hand luggages from us (overbooked flights. Remember?), where we had some cookies to nibble, after 36 hours without fresh kosher food. But then, to our final surprise, we found out that Swiss didn't even register kosher meals for us on the rebooked flight...

The situation was unbearable, but hey! Swiss only cared about their company and not about the customer. If you have kids, don't fly on a connecting flight with them! You will be targeted to be kicked off the plane at first opportunity!",April 2022,"August 10, 2022",1.0,3.0,,,1.0,,,,

Avoid this airline,Zurich,Adelaide,International,"I will not fly with Swiss airlines again. To begin, me and my partner were originally seated separately on a 12 hour flight and since we were given middle seats no one would swap with us so that we could sit together. Luckily, some people did not board the flight and we found two empty seats next to each other. My suggestion to anyone travelling with this airline is to check if they seated you and your friends/family together. Furthermore, the flight took off 30 mins late as we waited for people who were coming from Berlin. This lack of punctuality might mean that people who have connecting flights later miss their flight. To make things even worse, we were given one meal after take off and after that, it was 8 hours of no service. Having flown with other airlines before, there is normally snacks etc. delivered between the main meals to make the time in the airplane more bearable. This was not the case. In fact, the lights were dimmed for the whole 8 hours and we were told to keep our windows shut, making us lose all track of time. The plane was so cold that the one blanket they gave did nothing. I would avoid this airline and just choose another in the future.",August 2022,"August 8, 2022",1.0,,,,,,,,
Mediocre Service; Dilapidated Aircraft; Scrumptious Meals,Gdansk,Dubai,International,"The SWISS experience is a memorable one for sure. The seat width was decent and you are spoilt for choice when it comes to the movie selection available on the in-flight entertainment system. The TV show selection, however, was rather poor. 
I flew on the older A330-300 and the aeroplane was quite dilapidated. The TV Sceeens and seats were worn out and for some reason the audio on my system wasn't functional.
Even though the staff were a bit cold and unwelcoming, the delicious food made up for that.
The meal includes a slice of a scrumptious local Swiss cheese and, in my opinion, that's the highlight of the meal. The long haul journeys end with ice cream and they serve delectable Swiss Chocolates at the end of each trip.

the pilot of Swiss deliberately leaves our luggage behind,Zurich,Moscow,Russia,"Seated in the airplane, our child, who was by the window seat, exclaimed looking outside: ""Look, our suitcases are there!"".And indeed, our suitcases (which had colorful coverings which made them extremely recognizable) were on an airport trolley right by the airplane. And at that moment, the captain announced: ""Cabin crew, arm the slides"". Almost immediately we observed the workers on the airfield starting to cover the trolleys with our suitcases with some kind of fabric.

I rushed to the flight attendant: ""These are definitely our suitcases there right by the airplane. Would we not load them into the airplane?"" The flight attendant promised to check with the captain and went to the cockpit at once. Returning back, the flight attendant (name Attenhofer-Patt) replied: ""We are sorry. These are your suitcases, yes. We were given a time window to take off now and we don't have time to load your luggage into the airplane"". Two other flight attendants (Sasivari and Bacher) witnessed our situation of total helplessness.
Right at that time the airplane starts moving backwards. Our child, seeing all that happening, starts crying: ""There are our suitcases, aren't they gonna take them?"" We merely had to observe our luggage staying behind and comforting our child the way we could.

Throughout the flight, I kept asking myself these questions:
 * It is minus 22 at our destination, and our child's warm clothes are not coming with us. Do they think that treatment of the passengers is normal?
 * I am the organizer of my father's funeral in a few days upon arrival, and my clothes for the ceremony are left behind as well.

Upon landing, there were around 15 families in total including us who did not receive their luggage, apparently all from the trolleys we observed being left behind. Of our 3 suitcases we registered for the flight, 2 were left behind. Each of these families had to spend additional ~2 hours registering the lost baggage, most of them with children like us, already in the late hour. At some point, we observed the whole crew of the Swiss flight just passing by, without caring to stop by. They all had their suitcases with them, so why should they at all care??

Fast forward, after numerous phone calls to the airport to check the status of our luggage, the suitcases were delivered to us 3 days later(!) at 2 a.m. in the night. That was the earliest time they could deliver our luggage, but I agreed on that and spent the sleepless night, because my father's funeral was next morning and I desperately needed the contents of my suitcase by then.

As a conclusion from our side, we are not using Swiss these days for our summer vacation. Having passed through that experience of ours, we are confident in our decision to not use Swiss ever again at all. As you are reading this, I am asking you for your support. We, passengers with luggage, passengers with children, should not tolerate that attitude from the airline company. For the sake of a child, who cried at seeing his belongings left behind, please refrain from using Swiss airlines for your next trip.

Swiss, in past well known as ahead of competition in terms of service excellence, hospitality cabin comfort and recognition of most frequent customers significantly dropped in price performance ratio at outstanding high prices since beginning of Covid although there is not necessarily a link to the pandemic situation which affected other airlines (frequently used) as well. Some facts:
- no personal welcome of most frequent flyers (cost nothing)
- no welcome drink after boarding (cost almost nothing)
- old, noisy and over-used aircraft model A330 (investment needed)
- significantly reduced menu and beverage list (may have brought some savings)

- zero snacks during night flight, no staff visible (there is a shortage on personal)
- minimalistic service (might be linked to above)
- 50MB voucher when at First class for (poor) internet -> a joke vs economy in TK flights

NEVER TRAVEL SWISS AIR - There are 40 % chances that your check in baggage will never arrive ! 17000 < bags LOST,Malaga,Canton of Geneva,Europe,"NEVER TRAVEL SWISS AIR - There are 40 % chances that your check in baggage will never arrive ! 17000 < check in bags have been mishandled by the airlines staff. 

My check in bag was misplaced by their ground staff on July 3rd on my flight from Malaga to Geneva via Zurich.

After numerous emails and calls made to the Swiss airlines ground staff in Malaga, Swiss port staff in Zurich and Geneva, I still do not have any answer or tracing for my bag. 

The worldtracer form was updated with reference GVALX50059 with my family name MAHAPATRA. Neither the Swissport staff nor the Airlines staff are taking responsibilities to find my bag.

It is almost impossible to get hold of any of their representatives for any help for financial claim. The blame game continues between the Airport authorities in Malaga, Swissport staff and Swiss airlines. No one has any answer. To make things worse, SWISS airlines phone are hung up or kept busy from 9 am to 18:30 pm. Hence, you can never get hold of anyone from their team over the phone. 

There have been 170000 bags mishandled by the SWISS team between June 29th and July 3rd and no one bothers. The Swissport staff informed me there is 40 % chances my bag has been lost due to summer season ! 

Has anyone faced this kind of issue ever ? Can someone help me with what needs to be done here on ? 

Thank you all for your help.

Overall a terrible flight experience!,Newark,Mumbai,International,"EWR - Zurich 

Cons: 
- Wifi not working (pretty annoying for a 8 hour flight). 
- Seat was completely broken: Earphone plug not working properly, Hand rest couldn‚Äôt stay in place when lifted and it was difficult to take the media screen out of the seat. 
- You get a lot of leg space but I didn‚Äôt understand why did the flight attendants were always going through our leg area, they interrupted us a lot and even one time one flight attendant almost tripped over with her tray because she decided to go through us yet she saw that we have bags on the floor, and she still did it. That‚Äôs ridiculous. (Seat 29B) 
- No inflight snacks 
- Small breakfast (muffin)

Zurich - BOM

Pros: 
This flight was the complete opposite! 
Wifi was working properly. 
This time I received a proper functioning seat and most importantly the flight attendants were much more serious and didn‚Äôt pass through our lane at all! 
We even got a snack when we just took off and immediately after that received our first meal. 

Pros for both of the flights: 
- The meals were actually good!

My other half had a flight booked with BA at the same time us back to the UK and she requested a refund and straight away they gave her a full refund but when it came to Swiss Air they took over 2 months to do so and when they did they gave us back a refund considering our tickets were ¬£1200 for both of us, we only recieved ¬£130 as a whole and we felt really disrespectes and that they are cheap.

We took them at their word, but then my agent was contacted the first week of June, and was informed that the tickets expired on May 31, so no credit would be given.

In other words, they ran out the clock under the false pretense of issuing credit, but were really just making sure that they would not need to honor my tickets by letting them expire.  This is highly DISHONEST and UNETHICAL!!!  I am now out about $2,600 because this airline lied to my travel agent and me.

Lovely start and end to a Switzerland visit,London,Zurich,Europe,"The journey started a bit slow but that was my fault because I queued at the wrong place. It was crowded/very busy and the directions/signs were not clear enough. Though the queue was smaller at the right place, it started slow due to fewer staff members present. It picked up when a staff member came and another from a different airline helped out. The security process was very quick and the Lufthansa lounge area was a nice place to rest until boarding time. The plane was delayed for around 30 mins. Not sure why. However, it reached Zurich on time. The plane itself was nice and comfortable. I sat at the wrong seat at first (no idea how I managed that when I saw the number) but quickly realised and went to the right one before taking off. I did notice some stains on the wall next to my seat and used the wipes provided to clean it, including the table tray. Apart from that, all was good. The food was tasty. The crew members were very friendly and helpful. They all had smiles which were nice to see. Same with the return flight. The Swiss lounge was bigger and very comfortable, though it was busy. The upper floor (quiet area) had fewer people. The plane was a different model (I think smaller) and to be honest, I preferred that one. The staff members were friendly and engaging. We left Zurich on time. The food was delicious though I would have preferred a little less salt in the meat. The plane and my seat were very clean. I was enjoying the flight so much I was shocked when they announced we would be landing shortly in London. My brain could not process how that was possible because we were in Zurich not long ago. I think we arrived early haha (~20mins). The plane must have moved faster or something. Though I was glad we had a good and safe flight, I wanted to enjoy it a bit more. I had to wait a while to get my bag because immigration clearance was quick and other flights had to get their bags first. The takeoff and landing were smooth. I was very impressed with both flights. Kudos to the crew members for making the experience enjoyable.

Zero customer service,Canton of Geneva,San Francisco,International,"Note: flight was GVA-ZRH-SFO. Trouble GVA-ZRH to catch the United flight to SFO.

What a mess of an airline and severely lacking in customer service. Although there was an airline computer glitch on June 15, the flight was still listed as scheduled. Everyone was at the gate, boarding passes in hand, when it was announced that the flight was cancelled. What an uproar. Everyone was directed to head up to customer service to reschedule. (My booking was through United Airlines which has a co-share with Swissair).

I waited in line for just over 3 hours (yes three hrs). Finally, at the desk to receive help in re-booking a flight home only to hear the Swissair agent tell me that he could not re-book because I was flying on United miles/points. I was instructed to call United Airlines for assistance. Uh, hallo, CALL United when I'm in a foreign country? (An aside, my daughter was traveling back from Germany on the same day, also on points, also with a co-share--Lufthansa. Lufthansa easily took care of her, re-booked, even got her econ+ seats that same day. What a huge difference between Lufthansa and Swissair).

I finally was able to connect with United by phone (United's airport desk agents could not help since my ticket started with a short Swissair flight to Zurich). The United phone agent re-booked me on a flight the next day. Grateful for the re-booking, but not that helpful as I had no where to stay that night. She reminded me that my ticket was a contract with Swissair and since they cancelled the flight, they owed me a hotel room. Sigh, back to Swissair to again ask for help. The agent was reluctant, but I mentioned the ticket contract and that they had cancelled. She informed me that all their reciprocal hotels were filled. She finally told me to find a hotel and submit the receipt to Swissair after. Whether they reimburse me or not is yet to be known.

.,Valletta,San Francisco,International,"Me and my partner bought tickets about 4 months before the flight Malta-Zurich-San Francisco and back. We had two options Swiss and Turkish airlines. Swiss were a bit cheaper, and the duration of the trip (including flight change in Zurich) was perfect in both directions. So we chose Swiss air. About two months before our trip I received an email that the return flight Zurich-Malta was canceled. They offered to return the money or rebook for the next day. We could not cancel all tickets and buy at another airline, because the trip had already been planned, and the cost of tickets at other airlines has already increased. So we rebooked for the next day.
I have to say, the flight Malta-Zurich-San Francisco went perfectly. And I give the highest assessment of the work of the cabin crew. They are incredible people. 
But on the return flight it was just an opposite. My partner does not eat pasta. This is the only product she does not eat at all. And for the first meal we were given a vegetarian pasta, with no choice. So for 10 and a half hours of flight, she ate only yogurt and a small cheesecake that was in the second meal. 
Since we had to rebook Zurich-Malta ticket, our transfer in Zurich took 26 hours. That‚Äôs why on a check-in we were denied of transporting our luggage straight to Malta. We had to pick up our luggage in Zurich and carry it with us. 

In  Zurich I found a Swissair representative and asked about the possibility of staying one night at the expense of the company. As I know some companies that are care of their passengers provide it. But I was refused and explained that we had been warned about the flight cancellation in advance. He also gave me an email address of customer service to request this service.

Rude staff bringing down a good airline!! Come on Swiss Air!,Zurich,Mumbai,International,"As an avid international traveler, let me share my incident with you all.
A perfect example on how rude, poorly trained staff is ruining an airline which was once decently good!
Surprisingly, I have heard about their rudeness by several friends and colleagues on the Indian sub-continent sectors!

Reference 2205-LX-00415
Me, my wife and my 3-year old daughter were travelling on LX154 from ZRH to BOM.
It was clearly visible at the beginning of the flight that the crew for economy class looked very unhappy. May be something to do with the sector!!!!

During meal service, the steward (a young male) completely forgot to serve meal to my wife and went ahead two rows. To notify the steward that he missed serving meal to my wife, I politely said, ""Excuse me"". I was very rudely and angrily replied, ""Wait a minute"", by the steward. Once he came to my seat I told him that he missed serving meal to my wife and also told him that there is no reason to be rude when I am being polite. To this he replied, ""Please don't start"", angrily again. He served my wife the meal and moved on.
Later the stewardess (caucasian with a single braid hairstyle) came to me in a very intimidating manner and sat on the armrest of seat 35C. She started by saying, ""my colleague said there is a problem"". I explained her that her colleague was very rude when I politely mentioned that he missed serving meal to my wife.

Everything she spoke after this was in a very derogatory response. She started by saying that they are understaffed thus what are they supposed to do. I replied that I understand but being understaffed does not mean the Swiss staff can be unnecessarily rude to their customers. She kept on complaining that the staff is also human and they are frustrated too. The most shocking part was that she clearly told me on my face that ""Next time I should fly another airline instead of Swiss!!!"". To that I replied that she is no one to tell me that. I told her that lets agree to disagree. She noted my seat number (I don't know what for) and left. The same stewardess loudly told a person sitting three rows ahead that ""Sir this is not a restaurant""; when the customer asked for food options, politely.
The steward later apologized to me before leaving the flight but the stewardess needs to be sent back to customer service training, clearly.

As someone who is regularly travelling international for the past 18 years, this was the first time I have had such a bad experience with an airline staff. I completely understand if they are understaffed, but that gives them no right to be rude to me (a full ticket paying customer) when I was polite.

 To tell me that ""You shouldnt travel with Swiss next time"" directly on my face by a Swiss employee is the worst customer service I have faced in air travel. Unfortunately, the stewardess herself forgot that her salary comes from the tickets that people buy through Swiss Air.

I don't know how seriously this message will be taken, but I have provided the exact flight number, date, location, description so that this particular employee of Swiss Air can be tracked and taught how to behave with (polite) customers.

Tariffs Pricing Rebooking Scam,Thessaloniki,Zurich,Europe,"Online customer service  is useless, you are chatting with a low  quality  bot who is out of help. Hotline is not easy to get through.

An operator explained in each tariff light. Classic etc there is a subtariff which is in a form of lettres like X, XX which you do not see when you book, only when you receive the tickets you can see it and when you rebook they tell you wa are sorry but we can see in our system that you booked for example Economy Classic X but for a new flight we can only propose you Economy Classic XX  because yout previous tariffClassic X is no longer available do it would cost you 300 euros more while on their website you can book a new ticket at 200 euros.

"Worst customer service ever!!! NEVER AGAIN, don‚Äôt book Swiss",Luxembourg,Singapore,International,"In June 2021 we booked a business class trip from Europe to Asia, travel date Feb. 2022. It was a business saver tariff and we were looking forward to the trip due to the positive image Swiss enjoys in terms of their business class being very nice.
However, when Omicron hit in Nov. 2021, we decided to rather not go due to concerns of issues of not being able to travel at all as we‚Äòve got a small child and Singapore is known for its fierce rules etc. - so Swiss offered us to put the ticket on hold/leave it as an open ticket that we could use at a later stage without losing our money. So far, so good.
We then tried to use the ticket to book a new flight numerous times and always had to do it via phone. Several times it seemed to have worked after spending hours on the phone, queuing, connections breaking down etc. - but every time there was this small error message in the App.
So we contacted customer service - only to learn that the booking never went through and that we would have to pay an additional 5k Euro for it to work. Tried multiple alternatives but they basically said the prices we see online are not correct as the ticket cannot be changed like that despite the fact that we were literally granted an open ticket that would serve as a ‚Äûvoucher‚Äú to its full value.
We then got another confirmation for the flight and information that the route had been changed, so we assumed that it had worked. However, there was still this tiny message popping up.
So we called again, only to learn that it hadn‚Äôt gone through again. No one ever gave us full information on the terms and conditions. But eventually we got the info that we could now also change the route, which was news to us and that whatever prices we saw online we could see as a basis for the new booking. So we went for a new booking, only to learn that we couldn‚Äôt do it as the date wasn‚Äôt fitting because it had to be within a certain time frame which we weren‚Äôt informed about earlier. On that note they also casually told us that we had to book until the next day, otherwise we‚Äòd lose all our money (3,600 Eur). We then re-booked accordingly and gave our credit card details for a 2,000 Eur surcharge and got a booking confirmation. However, there was still the same error message in the system and the company also only charged my credit card with 0.01 Eur which was weird. So we called - again! For the umpteenth time in several months - only to learn that there was no booking because they had changed the time frame and we would have to leave 3 days earlier otherwise we‚Äòd losw our money.
I then tried to upgrade to a flex tariff but was kicked out of the line several times in a row. That was commonplace before, too, and the agents, especially a guy called Wafiq who wouldn‚Äôt give me his surname, were extremely rude.
We never got any proper written feedback or calls that there was a problem. It was only because we wanted to reserve special meals and seats that we saw the tiny error message (but still everything worked - I was able to change seats etc. and had a booking confirmation). So if I hadn‚Äôt done that, we‚Äòd have ended up arriving at the airport without a booking.

Altogether I spent about 8 hours on the phone over the course of several months of this odyssey. I got a ton of grey hair from that and had to change all our other travel arrangements numerous times.

Honestly: I‚Äòll never book with Swiss ever again. Now all I want is my money back and then never see or hear from that again, but I doubt that I will ever get that money back.

MY ADVICE: don‚Äôt book Swiss! They may portray themselves as high-class friendly Swiss airline, but their customer service is just terrible and they don‚Äôt give a damn about customer satisfaction. They will leave you completely on your own without any advice or information and if they talk to you, you cannot trust that information as they tell you one thing today and another tomorrow.

7 HOUR DELAY. BUSINESS AS USUAL,Newark,Tel Aviv,International,"After delaying almost an hour in the airport of origin, we of course arrived late, thus missing our connection.

During that time, no food. no drink. no accommodations. no phone call. no email. To top it all off, my baggage only arrived three days later!
After all that mess I tried to contact the airline for compensation, and nothing. Not only did they only get back to me a month after filing the claim, but their response was, NO REMORSE WHATSOEVER. Acting nasty all along, they just shrugged off all my anguish.

Most horrible airline ever,London,Nice,Europe,"Hi

On Friday, May 20th, after a long flight with Untied from SFO to LAX and then LAX to LHR, I was supposed to have a connecting flight from LRH to Nice through Zurich with Swiis airline.
Unfortunately, the first flight was delayed and I haven't been able to catch my second flight.
I had to go to the transfer desk (no one on the flight crew help me to find it) and after one hour of waiting. the desk person told me that all flights to Nice were fully booked until Monday (it was Friday). So I had to ask him if I could fly to Marseille, and probably rent a car to go to Nice, but the first available flight was the next day.
So I had to stay for the night at the Movenpick hotel, next to the airport.

Few things I would like to share:
- I paid for an Airbnb that I haven't been able to use and the Swiss airline refused to pay for it.
- At the Movenpick, the TV was not working and the internet was barely working.
- I haven't been able to get my luggage, so get a refreshment kit, I have a few feedbacks about this kit:
¬† ¬† - The t-shirt in my kit was XXL, but I wear S.
¬† ¬† - The toothpaste was impossible to open.
¬† ¬† - I got a razor, but shaving cream.
Concerning the food coupon, no one told me that it was limited to 20 CHF, so I ended up paying an extra 45 CHF (I needed a couple of glasses of wine after this horrible experience).

On my way back from Nice to Zurich, I also experienced a lot of issues with your airline:
- Issue with the electronics on the plane, forcing the plane to come back to the gate in order to reboot the plane.
- Last-minute changes forced to renew the flight documents.
- Last-minute changes forced us to add fuel to the plane.
- Last-minute error on the flight documents that forced us to wait for a new version of the documents.
- And finally, when we landed in Zurich, the group staff was late, forcing us to wait on the plane. 

The result has been to miss my connexion plane, again.
The entire experience before, during had after the flights has been awful, and I truly recommend people to not use this airline.",May 2022,"June 2, 2022",1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Wish I could give ZERO for reminding others,Hong Kong,Amsterdam,International,"My flight was cancelled by SWISS a week before the scheduled time, with a subject ""Change of reservation"".

I made my request of refund about a month later and received the last email from SWISS.

I started calling their office in HKG two and a half months later. Called the local  office number, pressed for Cantonese, they answered me with a Mandarin voice message asking me to call other offices. Pressed English, which I also tried for multiple times, directed me to somewhere no one ever picked up the call.

Then, I started calling the Switzerland office, which claims to provide 00-24 services. I called so many times again, Each time rang for half an hour to an hour. Before I gave up, someone answered. However, I was told she could not help and gave me another US toll-free number, coz I booked my ticket online (who's not??)

So, I repeated the calling and waiting for more times.

Absolutely UNBELIEVABLE!!! Far beyond unhelpful...

Be aware of Swiss mask rules,Montreal,Zurich,International,"Before leaving and also at booking I had checked on Swiss' web site the rules concerning wearing a mask. In Canada mask are mandatory for all flights and I would not even consider getting on a plane where people are not wearing masks, given the fact that if anyone sitting around you has COVID after 8 hours breathing their air you are sure to become infected. So reassured in the Web site where it says for Canada, masks on board, I was shocked as as soon as the doors were closed, the crew took off their masks. I told them on Canadian flights they are mandatory but the head flight attendant said as soon as we close the doors we are on Swiss law which does not require masks.

Well I did check after the flight Transport Canada regulations and it is indeed only on inbound flights. But I really believe Swiss should make the Swiss rule clear to passengers as it appears nowhere I could see on the Web site. You cannot choose Switzerland as a destination where I assume it would tell you no masks, and when you chose Canada it should really mention no masks on outbound flights.

I understand the rules are evolving but passengers should be well informed so they can take their decisions accordingly. For now I will stick to flights were masks are mandatory.

I tried to complain and they said Switzerland gives them this right to treat people like this.. which is not true and I can never get my money make because they such a big company they think they have the right to treat people like this.

SWISS is the best airline in the Lufthansa group,Stockholm,Zurich,Europe,"There are of course five huge airlines in the Lufthansa Group and they are Lufthansa, Austrian, Eurowings, Brussels Airlines and Swiss and Swiss is undoubtedly the best airline among them.

Deutsche Lufthansa the mother company was actually the very first airline I flew from Frankfurt to Newark and it used to be quite the solid product steaming of proud German industrial engineering and Bavarian efficiency. Their business class product used to be sophisticated and well worth the extra cost. 

But all that was indeed in the past and not anymore and the Lufthansa of today is just as every other low-fare airline in Europe these days. If given the choice to choose freely among these airlines I would strongly advice to chose Swiss as they are the most superior airline operating newer and better aircrafts, much better menu in flight, and better drink and beverages selection, as well as the bests airport for layovers in Z√ºrich at relatively competetive fares not often but every once in a while.",November 2021,"April 16, 2022",4.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,5.0

Traveller Beware!!!!  NEVER  Travel with Swiss Air,London,Ko Samui,International,"Having travelled the globe over many years I can hand on heart say we have never had such bad service as we did with this company. 
After booking a months breakaway in Thailand to see our daughter and new granddaughter and jumping through the many covid related bureaucratic hoops to get there, a week before our departure I checked  ‚Äú manage my booking‚Äù to find all six of our flights had been deleted.   We had no email or communication from the company.   
After some anxious hours and several very long phonecalls we were reinstated on the original flights.   We were told we had been sent an e mail changing the flights and because we hadnt responded to the alleged e mail they had deleted our flights. This would prove to be the first of many  fictitious e mails. 
A week befor our flight home I thought I had better check ‚Äúmanage my booking‚Äù again only to find the first of 3 flights deleted. I had to enlist the help of family back in England to help with the long phone calls to Swiss Air.  On a daily basis the flight was deleted and reinstated over the week prior to travelling home.  Our stress levels went through the roof and spoilt the last week of our holiday!!!  
When we arrived at the airport sure enough we were not on the  flight.   
To add to all our problems my husband has Motor Neurone Disease. We had checked with the carriers that we could take the scooter and they sent an e mail saying we could only to get told a week before we travel that he couldnt take it.  At this point it was too late to cancel our plans.

Not sure what to think,Canton of Geneva,Newark,International,"I flew economy and was treated well and I appreciated their rigor about mask wearing. All was good, on time, super helpful and professional staff. The entertainment boxes under the seats get hot and mean you have to sit at an angle, bad for hips and lower back. However, the flight wasn't booked full and there was room to spread out. The IFE options are poor compared to some airlines, but whatevs. The food was good. Mainly the staff made it a pleasure. 

I flew business the same route and found the cabin very tight. Every seat was booked and I'd say that means they overbooked given covid. I was put in the middle w a stranger right next to me. Nothing, not even a small plastic thing to separate us. (Except the table.) Really odd. 

The seat became a flat bed which is always great. The blanket was really nice, kind of had a heaviness to it from the wool. The pillow was sitting on the seat, not wrapped, which is maybe better not to think about. The food was good. 

In that small cabin, about six people weren't wearing masks or were partially masked the entire time and the staff didn't enforce the policy even when another passenger asked them to. The woman next to me had her mask below her nose from the time she walked in throughout the flight.  The men behind me weren't masked. A guy to my left wore his below his mouth. One couple didn't even pretend. I'd say 75 per cent of the little cabin was fully masked and 25 per cent didn't/wouldn't wear their masks.

Staff efficient but not friendly. Couldn‚Äôt use the toilets at one point because they were both closed off so shift change staff could use them - fair enough they need a bathroom but leave one for all the passengers at the end of the plane‚Ä¶ Anyway, the plane left late. As it was around a twelve hour flight you would
usually expect it to make up the time. It didn‚Äôt. It was due to land at 6.05am and in fact landed at 6.45am there was no explanation. The crew mentioned a couple of connections that would be tight but that everyone would be fine. My flight to London was 7.10. I asked for support to get there and was told just to go. They told me gate D36. Getting off the plane was a laid back affair, no urgency or prioritisation for passengers connecting, and there were quite a few. I disembarked and planned to move quickly, but no. There was a long queue, which I was at the back of, with a security check to exit the airplane. I spoke to ground staff about my connection and was told just to go again‚Ä¶ eventually we get through this random security check and I head for d36. You have to get a train. I head towards it and double check the departure board and it says my flight is e43‚Ä¶. More lost minutes‚Ä¶ I then go as quickly as I can and come to actual airport security. I am in another very long queue. I can see my flight out of the window from this queue. I eventually get to security and put everything through the scanner. I had a bottle of sealed duty free that I bought on the trip. They don‚Äôt know what to do with it and  I‚Äôm held back. The woman in front bought duty free cosmetics and she is also held back. They open her cosmetics (that are all officially sealed), agree that it is the product it says it is and then officially reseal it‚Ä¶ then of course they do the same to me. I eventually make it to my gate and of course it is deserted. It‚Äôs 7.30.. I look at my phone and I have a text from Swiss Air saying they booked me on another flight, to Brussels, at 7.20‚Ä¶. I ask someone who looks like air staff where I can get help and I have to go to the transfer desk, another train ride to terminal A. I arrive and get in another queue of all the people who missed their flights due to the late arrival of our plane. I am seen at 8.10am.

We were rebooked on a flight from Zurich to Geneva, and then from Geneva on to London Heathrow (which in case SWISS is not aware, is obviously a different airport in a very different location!). We could have bought tickets to Heathrow for substantially less if that is where we wanted to go.

Good Storm Handling,Canton of Geneva,Cork,Europe,"We were to fly to Cork from Geneva. 
Due to a pretty bad storm our flight got cancelled but I think the airline handled it well. 

After we heard that our flight got cancelled we received information within the hour via email about our new flight. 

We got new tickets, they were scheduled to fly into Dublin instead of Cork, which seem to have been a safer option as we could read on the news that other flights had had issues landing in Cork where the storm seem to have hit harder. 

When the plane landed they said on the speakers were to go for a bus the airline had arrenged to take us passengers to Cork.

Landing in the storm went well and felt stabile.

The agent cashed the fees but didn‚Äôt make any change. 

Arriving at Malaga airport, we didn‚Äôt have a seat and they told us that because we didn‚Äôt take the flight Zurich->Malaga, they froze our seats and we had to pay another administrative fee (35chf each) to be able to board.

Vacation was nearly destroyed by refusal to help and cooperate,Chicago,K√≥s,International,"This happened last summer (6 months ago) so this review is somewhat late. We had a very upsetting experience with Swiss International Airlines and we did file a complaint. I am writing this on behalf of our daughter (and us as well). With some distance to the event we still feel that the way we were treated by them was totally unacceptable and more importantly for other travelers; the way they operate when things do go wrong poses a problem to all customers. The issues I am talking about includes excessive wait times on the phone, a website that can‚Äôt be used in certain situations, being sticklers for Swiss Airline rules that prevent solutions for customers, and an unwillingness to cooperate and talk to other airlines, etc.

This is the story; our daughter went on a trip to Greece to meet up with her friends. We bought her very expensive tickets. We bought the tickets from United Airlines but the leg between Chicago and Z√ºrich and then Kos was operated by Swiss International Airlines. Swiss International Airlines canceled the flight and lost her bags, which contained some very expensive items. We don‚Äôt blame them for that but when things go wrong, that‚Äôs when you need customer service and that‚Äôs where things turned crazy.

When Swiss International Airlines canceled the flight they abandoned the counter at the gate. It was late in the evening. Our daughter was in the bathroom and when she came back everyone was gone and the screen said the flight had been cancelled. She went to the Swiss International Airlines main counter at the Airport to get help but no one was there. She was upset so we decided to help her. We called United Airlines first, after all we bought the tickets from them. They are not known for good customer service but they actually tried. They booked our daughter an alternative route. However, we were told that Swiss International Airlines had to release their booking first and they had not done so. We were informed that Swiss International Airlines wouldn‚Äôt talk to United Airlines and that we had to call Swiss International Airlines ourselves. To help us out United Airlines googled Swiss International Airlines and gave us a number, which unfortunately turned out to be a scam site that scammed us out of $200.00. It turns out Swiss International Airlines don‚Äôt want people calling them so finding their number is difficult, something scam sites take advantage of.

However, after finding the real Swiss International Airlines they put us on hold for one and a half hour just to tell us that they refused to release our daughter‚Äôs ticket. That could only be done at a Swiss International Airlines counter. Unfortunately, the Swiss International Airlines counters at O‚ÄôHare were closed. We had flights cancelled on us before and this has never been an issue with other airlines. We were baffled and in shock. I called United Airlines again and my wife called Swiss International Airlines and we timed it so that we got them both talking at the same time. We were lucky that it worked. United Airlines also had excessive wait times (up to an hour) but it was a bit better than Swiss International Airlines. By holding the two cell phones next to each we were able to get the United Airlines agent and the Swiss International Airlines agent to talk to each other. Yes it was quite comical. The United Airlines agent was able to convince the quite brusque and unfriendly rule-stickling Swiss International Airlines agent that the only way to rebook our daughter‚Äôs flight was for Swiss International Airlines to release her ticket and that they had to do it now. It worked, unfortunately the Swiss International Airlines forgot to release the Z√ºrich to Kos part so we had to repeat the process a second time. In the end United Airlines was able to rebook her and she got to Kos.

When she arrived in Greece her luggage did not. Swiss International Airlines had lost her luggage and had not returned it to United Airlines, so United Airlines suggested that she file a delayed baggage claim with them. We tried doing that on-line but Swiss International Airlines would not allow it since the ticket was purchased from United Airlines. I should mention that none of our problems could be solved using Swiss International Airlines website. Our daughter talked to the Swiss International Airlines baggage claim at Athens & later Kos airport who was not only refusing to do anything about the luggage, saying it was United Airlines problem, but they were also rude to our daughter and was yelling at her. United Airlines had to find the luggage despite the fact that Swiss International Airlines had not released her luggage to United Airlines and refused to talk to them. Luckily United Airlines was able to track it down three days later and she got it four days late. In my opinion, an airline refusing to help with baggage that is lost is confiscation of private property perhaps theft. We filed a complaint with Swiss International Airlines but we got no response.

Phew that was a horror story. Swiss International Airlines, never again.",July 2021,"February 5, 2022",1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0
"Cancelled flights, Rude Incompetent Customer Service, Unauthorised Money Deducted",Melbourne,Berlin,International,"What a pity flight crew are brilliant but Customer Service are the most horrific ever. 
Our issues started with Swissair cancelling the 3rd leg of our flight which was Zurich to London, alternative flight offered was not suitable as we‚Äôd arrive after the function we wanted to attend in London so we requested 3rd flight be altered Zurich to Berlin. Same distance, same cost, seats available.
 2 hours of dealing with difficult staff based in Fiji I decided to ring Zurich direct and was able to book seats if I paid an additional $1100 total for 2 seats.
I was unhappy but agreed, I was asked to confirm this by email, Swissair sent me an email stating I agreed to a SINGLE transaction of  $1100 for Mr & Mrs ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I sent a reply agreeing to this alteration and charge.
 1 week later flights had not been changed. I rang and spent another 90 minutes with Fiji staff who told me to check my bank account, no transaction had taken place! I then arranged for the flights to be rebooked. 2 days later checking my bank account $2490 had been deducted. I rang again and finally spoke with a supervisor who not only was rude but left me for 40 minutes without coming back, I rang on a 2nd phone line and was told she was busy and couldn‚Äôt speak with me. 
I rang again the following day and was told the $2490. was the correct amount even though I had a Swissair email stating the single transaction $1100 was for 2 passengers.
Swissair then cancelled the large transaction and deducted TWO amounts of $1200 each.
I rang again and asked to speak with a supervisor and was told that supervisor was busy and couldn‚Äôt speak with me, I said I would wait, I was told I could wait but I‚Äôd be waiting until the next morning!
Such rude staff I have never ever dealt with, not only are they unable to resolve issues but they are rude and lie as well. Female staff were the worst.
I contacted my bank to dispute the amounts and today I‚Äôve been advised the additional payment will be returned 7 weeks after they deducted it.

My daughter also had her flight to Paris cancelled 3 days before departure and was going to be left in Hong Kong! She was told there was nothing they could do however she was able to find an alternative flight online whilst on the phone, asked to speak with a supervisor who agreed there was an alternative flight she could fly on.

Worst customer service,Zurich,Lisbon,Europe,"I am very unhappy with the way SWISS treated me, showing that clearly they do not value me as a costumer.

I booked a flight for my wife and daughter with inbound on December 27th and outbound on January 7th.

They went to the airport, on the 27th, waited 6 hours to have my wife tested for covid (Lisbon airport was chaos that day, and there were no other alternatives for testing), and when I saw they were going to lose the flight, I tried to rebook it online, the website didn't allow it. I tried calling SWISS, no one was answering. I then sent a message asking for the second flight not to be cancelled, since I would get another flight for inbound.

That message was only answered 10 days after, telling me that I had to call support, and pay an  'out of sequence fee'.

I called support. The operator told me she could not make an out of sequence rebooking, that had to do a normal rebooking with huge costs. I told her this was totally unacceptable. I told her to tell her supervisor, that either they give me an out of sequence rebooking, or if they forced me to accept this rebooking, I would no longer fly with SWISS. Apparently her supervisor said he was ok with that.

After that they called me back, saying something went wrong, and asked for more money. Finally when I checked the credit card, they charged more than they asked the second time. And I repeatedly asked for the final total price on all calls.

It is clear to me that:
- If there is a problem non related to the passenger that make them miss the flight, your support does not work, forcing the passenger to find other alternatives.
- They reply late.
- They reply with wrong information (email I received says I can get an out of sequence rebooking, support on the phone says I cannot)
- They do not value customers that fly with them almost every month.
- The supervisors do not care about the customers.
- They take all opportunity to get money, customer satisfaction is not important for them.

After that we exchanged many messages, with them always replying very late, and not addressing any of my questions at all, just saying: We are sorry you are unhappy, but we just followed procedure.

Poor customer service from Swiss Air and Dolfi1920,Madrid,Zurich,Europe,"Flew with Swiss Air on 14th Jan 2022 but when I collected my luggage at the carousel and only after I arrived home I noticed that both wheels were almost ripped off from the luggage. I submitted and filled baggage claim forms for reimbursement / repair the following morning. 

I had sent multiple emails explaining that I have an onward flight with them and that I needed this resolved immediately. Swiss Air customer service and Dolfi1920 ignored my emails and didn't respond. I was advised by Swiss Air to deal directly with their outsourcing partner, Dolfi1920 to get the reimbursement or luggage repaired. I stated that since I flew with Swiss Air, they are still liable for any damages and liability, just because they outsourced it to Dolfi1920 doesn't make them exempt from their liability.

I subsequently got an email from Dolfi1920 after much pestering and with Swiss Air customer service department managed to get them to reimburse me for the destroyed luggage. During which time Dolfi1920 only asked for my IBAN and SWIFT and no other information was provided like how much was the refund, in what currency would I be paid as I had bought and paid the luggage in USD, etc. Note you will have no choice but to deal with Dolfi1920, another bunch of daft idiots that don't respond.

Dealing with Swiss Air customer service was a complete nightmare, receipts would be provided and nothing would be heard from them for 3 days, meanwhile I still have to catch my onward flight. Swiss Air assumes that because they have outsourced the baggage repair to a third party, the risk is transferred to the customer, unfortunately this is not how outsourcing works.

Its one of the worst airlines I have had to deal with especially the silence and lack of transparency shown by their customer service. At Swiss Air, it isn't customer centric, it's customers last! 

Don't fly Swiss Air if you can help it, this was just a simple luggage complaint that could have been resolved in alot less time than 15 days. I even sent an email expressing my disgust to the CEO Dieter Vfranckx but zero response, shows clearly if leadership is lacking at the top, it will also reflect the lackadaisical approach taken by customer service!

Disgustingly poor,London,Johannesburg,International,"I never write reviews. However, this was such a shambles, and I felt so much that I'm being abused, that I had to write.
- Online systems are outdated and unreliable. Even if you sometimes click on 'contact us' you go to a page that says 'page not found'.
- Useless, rude and unprofessional customer service agents. After waiting for hours on the phone they actually hang up on you (and I was not being abusive!).
- I've waited days to get responses to messages. The responses are then just useless, standard messages copied from their useless web pages.

Only book Swiss if you have no other choice,Dublin,Zurich,Europe,"I use Swiss since years, but only if i have no other choice ( I'm Swiss living in Ireland) They have the worst website of all airlines i ever used. It ends up most of the time that i actually have to ring them and book on line and fight for not having to pay extra because i could not book on line. It is hard for me to accept that in 2022 Swiss still do not have a proper working website. I van book a flight with all European airlines in 10 min, but it takes 30 min and 3-4 attempts with Swiss still i just give up again.

"Putrid, Robotic, Unfriendly Service!",London,Johannesburg,International,"Unfortunately my experience with the Swiss Contact centre based in South Africa is the same as others on this platform. Extremely poor! If there was a negative score for customer service I would give it.

We spoke to Enaira on 26 November 2021 and needed to change our flight urgently due to the UK restrictions with flights to South Africa which came into effect the day we were meant to fly out. Enaira was very helpful but that's where it stopped. Anira also told us that since we paid the travel agency fee once we will not have to pay it again. She also said the new booking was now direct with Swiss air and this is why there will be no other travel agency fee if we changed the booking again.

We now find that there are no longer restrictions to SA from the UK so we wish to change our flight again.

We spoke to Kim last night who gave us a price for the fare difference and said there was no travel agency fee. After being on hold for 45min to get to Kim, she put us hold to check other cheaper dates. She left us on hold and never came back to us. We spent over an hour on the phone.

We called again this morning 9 January 2022 and spoke to Tyler (female) in a SA contact centre. She was the worst of them. She sounded dead alive and robotic. She kept repeating that we had to pay a travel agency fee again. We told her many times that this was incorrect and not what we were told previously by 2 separate agents. She kept repeating herself. We asked to speak to someone else and she said I must disconnect and call back. We asked for a supervisor and she said no-one was available. She said she will ask for a call back but couldn't tell me when that would be.

Absolutely poor and the worst thing is I don't think it will get better because Swiss air obviously doesn't monitor the calls to make sure agents are giving good customer service.

All we want is to change our flight without a travel agency fee like we were told and to be given a fair price to pay, especially when considering the price for a new flight on the website is less than what we originally paid. I'm not sure how there is a fare difference.

I will be looking to escalate this further to an ADR or the CAA if I do not get a response asap and a fair resolution.",November 2021,"January 9, 2022",1.0,,,,,,,,

Besides waiting for ages for someone to pick up the phone, e-mails will also simply stay unanswered. Because according to them ""no airline can be reached out to via email"". How absurd is that? 

If someone finally decides to pick up the phone, it is their incredibly unfriendly employees. They constantly interrupt you and make frequent passive-aggressive remarks. How are they supposed to understand my request without letting me finish my sentence? I have never experienced such a terrible customer service!

Refunds are not processed, although they have been submitted online for a long time. There is also no communication about the process on the behalf of Swiss. In addition, you have to deal with employees who insist that they would rather take care of customers with ""JUSTIFIED problems"" and constantly remind you that they already spent ENOUGH time talking to you now.

Insulted by airline staff ignorant about their own Covid test rules,Paris,Hong Kong,International,"We were checking in at Paris CDG for our flight to return to Hong Kong. In between there was going to be a transit in Zurich. The HK Gov is famously strict on arriving passengers' documents due to Covid (booked 21 days of quarantine hotel stay) so we got to the check-in counter 3 hours early.

We were one of the first in line. Before us, there had been a Chinese couple who seemed to get through, no problem. When it came to us, the Swiss Air staff member at the counter took a look at our Covid test and said, 'You did your test 65 hours before the departure time.'

To which we replied, 'Well yes, because the rule was within 72 hours. 65 is within 72, is it not?' (Swiss Air had sent us an email reminding us of this requirement. Do your test 72 hours before your final departure point, i.e. Zurich in this case)

And he gives us the most uppity look ever and says, 'It's risky to take the test 65 hours before the departure. Why didn't you take it closer to the departure time?'

We said we couldn't find a pharmacy in downtown Paris that we were sure would deliver results on a Sunday, so we played it safe. Anyway, we had followed their rules. He then said, 'The couple that came before you manged to find a pharmacy. They did their test 40 hours ago.'

At this point we are wondering what ridiculous, surreal situation we were in, and we simply reiterate that '65 is a number under 72 and well within the rules.'

He said, and I quote his exact words, 'You are playing with words.'   (?!!! Does he not know how to read his own company policy??!)

We of course ask to see the manager. For those of you who don't know, if you miss your flight to HK, you don't get any refund for the 21-day hotel quarantine stay that you booked, which amounts to a lot of money. Plus all the hotels were fully booked by then and we'd have to stay in Paris until a quarantine hotel in HK freed up a room.

His manager comes along, and we explain the situation. Naturally we're a bit flustered but we have never raised our voice. We are simply in shock that the rules are written black and white, and that this staff member has chosen to put their own spin on them. The first thing the manager says to us is, 'I need you to calm down, otherwise I have the right to stop you from boarding.' when we have shown no sign of rudeness at all.

Finally, they call yet another manager and we're OK to check in. We get no apology from the staff after they wasted our time and accused us of wordplay!

Only two counters were open for a queue of 70 people. We held up the line for 30 minutes. It's simply shocking that when rules are so simple, there are people out there who seem to want to give themselves more trouble and make their job even harder...I still don't understand why they did it. I get that HK has strict rules and not all airline staff are well-versed in this, but when there's a flight to HK, would they please put someone who knows what they're doing at the counter? Never mind - not even the manager knew how to read.

On another note, as with most other places we saw in France, all the staff members had their mask pulled below their nose, and when they needed to articulate, pulled down their mask completely to speak...",December 2021,"January 3, 2022",1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0

The worst airline they take your money for no flight,London,Zurich,Europe,"I booked two return flights to Zurich for April 2020. These were cancelled and as I've been prepared to 'work with' businesses and help them through the pandemic I accepted their offer of a voucher for future use.

These vouchers were used to book flights on the same route for 2nd December. I had to pay an additional amount of money as there was a fare difference.

At the weekend the Swiss government applied a 10 day quarantine to all arrivals from the UK.  On 29th November, Swiss air wrote to me advising I was ineligble to fly.

I tried to get through to them on the phone as the only online option was to book flights for a future date (how can you do this at the moment?) and pay them even more money.  After 115 minutes in the phone queue I was finally through to someone but no sooner had I spoken to them, they put me on hold then cut me off.  I tried a bit later that day to call again (who has time for such poor service?) On the second occasion I waited a little over an hour to speak to someone. I then had the most bizarre conversation where having advised me that I couldn't fly, they asked did I want to cancel and receive a taxes only refund? (approx 40% of what I'd paid) I said no I want a full refund as you have denied me boarding so you have cancelled me. At this point I was put on hold and then cut off for the second time.
 I decided the only course of action left to me was to contact my credit card provider (the first time I've had to do this for any booking with any firm all through the pandemic).

It gets even more bizarre though, on 1st December they checked me in ""automatically"", despite telling me on Monday that I'm ineligible to fly. I assume this is further sharp practice so they can say that the ticket has been used. I have passed this onto my credit card provider as further evidence in advance of my flight departing.

It's not surprising their phone queue is so long as they have no suitable options online to handle you as they only really want to get you into a type of ponzi scheme where you pay them more and more for a future flight that you may again be denied or alternatively just thieve you out of what you have paid them so far.",December 2021,"December 3, 2021",1.0,,,,,,,,

I arrived 2.5 hours early, and did not have a moment to sit down- I literally spent the entire time waiting in huge lines of hundreds of other passengers to check in, go through security, go to passport check (all of which I understand), then inexplicably wait in the airline‚Äôs own ‚ÄúPassport Control‚Äù line just to receive a stamp on my boarding pass needed to then wait in the line to board. These latter two lines snaked all the way down the entire concourse for our booked full 777-300er to SFO. All their ‚ÄúPassport Control‚Äù does is glance at your passport, which the gate agent does again anyway, so why have this extra step? It just created a huge amount of confusion and extra time standing in lines. They then only leave 35 minutes to board 340 passengers, which is completely unrealistic, hence these flights depart late almost every day. United begins boarding widebodies an hour ahead of takeoff, which is really what‚Äôs needed to avoid a delay. Anyway, that‚Äôs my two cents on the ground experience in Zurich. 
Onboard, it‚Äôs a completely different story. Although legroom is rather tight in coach, the cabin is beautifully outfitted, very clean, has nice large lavatories with no lines to use them, and even on a completely full flight didn‚Äôt feel too claustrophobic. The seats are very comfortable with beautiful upholstery, a comfy pillow and large warm blanket, the inflight entertainment system is extensive, has a large screen, and is easy to use, even holding your place in a film midway through if you leave to look at the flight map, and best of all, has no ads like US carriers love inserting before every program. There was no wifi on board, despite signs on the seats stating the contrary, nor regular power outlets (only slow USB ports). However, 12 hours actually flew by thanks to the extensive inflight service. You won‚Äôt go hungry on Swiss! They came by with a delicious, large, hot meal (chicken or pasta with vegetables, salad, roll, Swiss cheese and dessert), then two rounds of sandwiches and ice cream, then a landing meal of bruleed Swiss cheese over a warm quiche. The flight attendants were very courteous and really made you feel ‚Äútaken care of‚Äù. So I do recommend Swiss for long-haul, particularly in-bound to Switzerland as opposed to outbound!",December 2021,"December 2, 2021",4.0,,,,,,,,
Its UNWISE to BOOK  flight with SWISS in Covid. You may loose Money & get Harassed,Amsterdam,Zurich,Europe,"Extremely poor display of Customer service & lack of empathy for passengers who have shown trust in booking flights with SWISS.

I had weekend plan with family to visit Switzerland & return in 3 days time.
The Swiss authorities suggest they wouldn't allow passengers from Netherlands to enter Switzerland if we're not residents of Switzerland.  Even to residents they require a mandatory 10 day quarantine.  Also Zurich canton suggested Airlines has been informed & that they'll soon be informing passengers that they wouldn't be able to honor the tickets.  BUT the Airlines claim they're waiting for Swiss Govt's final response & cannot refund before they get a response.

Customer service calls take 1-2 hour long waiting & you get added harassment.

Customer service just repeated that they are not responsible for the restrictions the government imposes. Well fair enough, but then why am I bearing the FULL responsibility? Am I responsible?! A voucher would have been the best compromise so we BOTH bear some responsibility.

Economy in Business,Bangkok,Zurich,International,"Let me start with the title of this review. There is an airline whose motto is First in Business and you get a first class service in business class. On this particular flight, LX181 25th November 2021, this was as I said economy in business. 
The most annoying thing on this flight were a couple sitting close to us that seemed to think that not wearing their masks for the flight was ok and the crew completely ignored the fact and did not at any time tell them to put their masks on. This particular couple also seemed to get more attention that any other passengers in the smaller of the 2 business class cabin on the 777  flight from Bangkok to Zurich. This, I believe, was because they were Swiss nationals.
I can not fault the seat, as this was large and spacious, although using the controls could be awkward at times. The table is also not the best but it dose the job. 
Entertainment, well I think I will leave it there as there was very limited choice.
Food, well probably a little better than what you would be served in economy class and of course served on proper plates and knives and forks.
This is a general complaint, not only of Swiss, but all airlines. WHY do they all seem to insist that the sweet is chocolate? This is one food that will keep you awake when you are trying to sleep.
Something else I found annoying was the fact the the aircraft lights were not dimmed fully, or even out like most other airlines on a night flight. Also the steward from the first class cabin did not give too hoots about the amount of noise he was making every time he opened or slammed shut storage cupboards where equipment was stored for the first class cabin in the business class area. No thought and certainly no care.
All in all the only difference between economy and business on this flight was the seat. I felt that everything else was a complete let down. This flight did not live up to earlier flights on Swiss, even when there was a technical problem on our outbound flight on an older A340. 
Just one last thing, where were the small Swiss chocolates after the meals???? none handed out at either food service on this flight. 
Not the best example of Swiss Air.",November 2021,"November 26, 2021",3.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0
They charged 100‚Ç¨ extra for luggage that was already paid for and didn‚Äôt even attempt to help with the problem,Venice,Nice,Europe,"We booked our tickets through the agency eDreams and paid for additional bags in advance, but apparently the communication between the agency and the airline is extremely faulty, so they were not included in our final tickets. The airline ended up shamelessly charging us an additional 100‚Ç¨ at the check-in without even attempting to help us solve our problem. They even said: ‚ÄúOh, that happens quite often!‚Äù How is that ok? One might ask. I tried contacting both agency and airline afterwards, but to no avail. The agency turned out to be one with a lot of unsatisfied customers, but we expected at least Swiss to react in any way. After the first response on my Twitter post (of course they react when you confront them openly) I got them to respond privately but after a day or two they started ignoring me and left my problem unsolved.

HORRIBLE customer service,Athens,Zurich,Europe,"I tried to rebook one of my flights by calling your customer service.

I had to repeat the details of the flight I wanted to book (date, time, origin, destination) about 5-6 times. During the process she was not sure what she was supposed to do so I had to wait about 5 times for her to contact her ""support team"". 

The worst part was that when she wanted to calculate the fare difference between the previous and the new flight, she said again she does not know how to do that and after contacting her support team again (and wasting my time further) she finally said I have to pay 1500 euro for the fare difference. That was for a flight from Athens to Zurich that costs less than 100 euro if booked online! It is really a SHAME that Swiss forces their European customers to talk to a team in India that clearly has no clue about what they're doing and do not even understand how much money 1500 euro is.

Fast forward, unfortunatly we cannot attend this flight due of corona and new work-shedules. Again multiple times in the calling line to finally reach someone, we also tried different languages but often after 30min we also had to do other things.

They are not heading in the right direction. Sep. 22 this year was flying from Chicago to Zurich, with my wife, in business. Day early we fulfilled all Swiss requirements, COVID and travel related, and printed boarding passes and luggage tags at home.
At the check in we were asked for Covid test results even though we are fully vaccinated, which was requirement for transiting via Zurich and entering our final destination, Belgrade, Serbia. We were harassed by the O‚ÄôHare Manager, Ms. Eky, despite the fact that I have shown her printouts of what is required. I had no choice but to take a cab to downtown Chicago and back in order to board the flight.
Needless to say, we finished our trip with vaccine certificates and doc that we had at the airport to start with.

Did not see mask use enforcement in flight for passengers - felt unsafe,Zurich,New York City,International,"I don't usually write reviews but I must really inform that mask wearing was not enforced during this long haul flight.  Many passengers spent the whole flight or parts of it not wearing a mask (they were not eating or drinking and were older than 2 years old).  Some boarded with the mask on their chins and were not asked adjust them. This airplane was very large and has at least 300 passenger, I would say about 20% were not complying with the mask wearing rules.  This is not fair for other passengers that do want to protect their health and do go through the hassle of wearing it for 8 hours. And yes, I am vaccinated, but never the less, to avoid infection all boarding the plane should be wearing it properly for most of the flight and be reminded when they don't .  I did not feel comfortable at all on this flight for this reason.  The other problem related to Covid, was that the stewardess allowed passengers to seat on other persons seats to see if by chance they didn't show up.  That meant for us that our seats were in complete disarray when we arrived and if there was any disinfection it was useless in this case.    It's a shame to have to write such a review, as the airline had some other positive aspects.  I was impressed by the fact that the captain was woman, she did a beautiful landing.  The food was pretty good for regular airplane standards. The seats had a reclining position that sometimes doesn't stop at the desired location and can be very bothersome when fully reclined for the person behind you. The lines for boarding were insane, but I think that this was not the airline's fault, it had to do with the entry rules changes to USA.",September 2021,"September 15, 2021",3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,5.0
Terrible customer service in case of luggage loss,Warsaw,Zurich,Europe,"Every airline is fine as long as things go well. What really matters is how they react when there are problems, and Swiss failed this test miserably.

When we arrived at our destination, our baby buggy was gone. This was a real problem for us because we need it on a daily basis even for the most simple errands. We repeatedly tried to reach someone accountable both through the customer service hotline and through the online form. The customer consultants kept telling us that they cannot help with lost luggage. The messages submitted through the online form went unanswered until after two weeks, someone was kind enough to let us know that Swiss will keep looking. Three logistically difficult weeks since our arrival, we were finally informed that our buggy could not be found.

Swiss was willing to pay refund for the buggy but subtracted 27% from the original price because it was four years old. However, we are not able to buy an equivalent buggy for this price. We politely let them know that we don't understand why we should suffer a financial loss from the airline's mistake after already having suffered weeks of significant inconveniences.

The worst customer service I encountered in a long time,Tel Aviv,San Francisco,International,"This review concerns post-flight customer service.
I flew with Swiss Airlines on Aug 4 from Tel Aviv to San Francisco. Via Zurich. Since I was dreading the possibility of sitting in a center seat flanked by two strangers during the COVID pandemic, I purchased reserved seating to ensure an aisle seat on both flights. The reservation, for which I paid 70 US dollars, was made already in May.
Shortly before the flight Swiss sent me an email informing me that they changed my seat assignment. They did not disclose the position of the reassigned seat, but wrote that they have done their ‚Äúutmost to assign an adequate seat‚Äù. When I boarded the plane, I discovered that they have placed me in a center seat, flanked by two strangers who did not keep their masks on ‚Äì exactly the scenario I was trying to avoid.
On the official SWISS airlines website I see the following:
Might SWISS change the seat I reserve in advance, later on?
If SWISS has to change your seat reservation, e.g. due to a short-notice change to the aircraft type used, SWISS will do its best to automatically reserve you a new seat in the seat category you have booked. If it is not possible to reserve an equal seat for you, you may apply to receive a Refund of the charge online.
Upon arriving to my destination, I filed a request for a refund. I was answered 11 days later by a customer feedback consultant named Ilisapeci ****a. She flatly refused my claim. When I politely pointed to her that the official website states that I am entitled to a refund she gave this rude answer: ‚ÄúSWISS has responded adequately in your case. I therefore trust in your understanding that this message reflects our final position and that this file is now considered closed.‚Äù
I was shocked by her response, and asked her for contact information for her supervisor, which she completely ignored. I then tried calling the US customer service phone number. I tried twice, but gave up after waiting for 60 minutes each time. This airline has the worst customer service I encountered in a long time.",August 2021,"August 25, 2021",1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
"Ghastly, ghastly booking, ticketing, check-in and customer service systems",Canton of Geneva,New York City,International,"On a positive note, based on our recent experiences, the actual experience of flying Swiss is pretty passable:   staff in the airplanes and at check-in are mostly friendly and courteous in person, food is good, inflight entertainment is good and ‚Äì most importantly ‚Äì we have had good experiences with their treatment of animals.

There is no way around the fact however that overall it is time-consuming and nerve-wracking to fly Swiss, as their electronic systems appear entirely dysfunctional and their helplines severely understaffed to the point of uselessness. These are not idle considerations; we have lost days of time and been subjected to severe and aggravation and stress as a result of this senseless dysfunctionality.   Here is one single recent roundtrip (Geneva-New York JFK-Geneva as originally planned ‚Äì i.e. not the world‚Äôs most complex travel route):

1.	February 2021: Reserved tickets by telephone (4 people and dog), for July-August travel, Geneva-New York JFK-Geneva; person on the telephone very helpful: she assisted me in making the booking, and conscientiously helped me understand the rules concerning bringing dogs to the US. She told me that I could confirm the reservation and pay within 3 days.    The possibility of direct travel was particularly important to us, because we were shipping our family dog in the hold, for the first time. On the basis of this reservation, we cancelled another reservation with Delta.

2.	Called back 24 hours later to confirm booking and pay. During a first attempt I was put on hold for 25 minutes, after which I hung up and called again. During a 2nd attempt, I was put on hold for 45 minutes, and then told that the fare I had been quoted yesterday was no longer valid, and that the total cost of the tickets would be 300-400 CHF more than I was told the previous day. When I stated that this was not acceptable and expected the quoted price, I was put back on hold, and then ""transferred to my supervisor"". After a further 1 hour and 10 minutes, someone picked up, said ""ca va"" and then hung up on me. 

3.	After three days of subsequent calling and emailing, I received the original booking and tickets.

4.	July 2: We went to Geneva airport on the day of our ticketed flight and discovered that it did not exist (!).   The entire Geneva-New York Swiss Air route had apparently been cancelled 3 months previously.   We had neither been informed nor re-ticketed.   Swiss staff at the airport asked how it was possible that we had these tickets.

5.	A Swiss agent re-ticketed us, routing via Zurich to Newark the same day. Family members with anxiety disorders had severe reactions due to the suddenly unexpected change in the shipping condition concerning the dog ‚Äì i.e. that she would not be travelling directly, but would spend many additional hours in transit, without us.  The rerouting also added significant additional cost to our travel to our final destination (outside New York), as we could not take regular ground transportation, but had to add an additional very expensive taxi.

6.	August 20 (the day before the return trip): endeavoured to check in online, because the Swiss government requires that seat numbers be provided in the entry form for entry into Switzerland, which one is required to fill out prior to coming to the airport.  The online system (1) had our tickets in a different price category and so knew nothing about our 4 checked in pieces of luggage; and (2) crashed repeatedly. Ultimately, we could not check in online.

7.	 August 21 (return trip): while checking in, the agent requests that we pay for a second time ‚Äì 400 USD -- for our dog, because she is not in the system, notwithstanding the fact that I have a print out of our original invoice.

That was only one round trip, between two heavily trafficked, developed-world destinations.

This is simply insane levels of systemic incompetence for a purportedly world class flagship carrier.   I am still in shock that we actually made it back to Switzerland.",July 2021,"August 23, 2021",2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,,,1.0,3.0
Incredible incompetent personnel.,Zurich,Cluj-Napoca,Europe,"Extremely disappointed by this airline!!!!! Definitely not Swiss quality.
First and foremost, they hang up on you constantly or leave you on the line and never get back to you. They never call back either. 
I had around 10 consecutive calls with them, they all behaved the same. I also opted that my calls be recorded so that these employees can suffer the consequences.
Story:
I had to cancel a flight of mine and therefore I have received via phone a Voucher (without even an email confirmation of the voucher). The services are so bad, that not even an email confirmation can be sent for such a Voucher, nor a code which one can simply use at re/booking. Instead, one has to call.
Well, this is the worst part. I called then multiple times. Each call about 50 minutes and all personnel were incompetent to re/book my flight. 
This is why they say that the waiting period is long, because one employee takes about 1 hour to ""solve"" a 10-minute issue. The problem is that they are so incompetent that not even that gets solved. And one must recall 1000 times to have the ticket.
Second worst problem is that Swissair and Lufthansa ""operate"" together, and one can buy from Swissair Lufthansa operated tickets, when one buys with connections. The main ticket is on Swissair. However, when calling and asking for the flight which is maybe operated by Lufthansa, the personnel is completely lost.",August 2021,"August 19, 2021",1.0,,,,,,,,

NO MORE SWISS AIRLINES!!!,Zurich,Stockholm,Europe,"After my last flight experience with Swiss Airlines, I just want to say no more Swiss Airlines for me. 

The reason for that is as follows.
On Sunday, July 25th, 5:45 pm, we were supposed to fly from Zurich to Stockholm (LX1254), and the plane was supposed to land in Stockholm at 8:10 pm.

For some reason, the boarding started at. 6:15. 

When the boarding is complete, the captain will tell us that we'll be late for a few minutes. Almost 75 minutes later sitting in the airplane, the captain tells us we need to change airplane and all passengers would go to another gate for bus ride to the new airplane. 

While we hurry upp to the new gate, I get a text message from Swiss Airlines with a voucher to buy food from restaurants that were located far from the new gate. I thought it was a joke from Swiss Airlines! Who had time to go away to the restaurants area when the captain said we'd hurry to the new gate???!!!! 

We had to wait another 30 minutes before they allowed us to get on the bus. We discovered then that they had only ONE bus to drive in several rounds from the terminal to the new aircraft, which was time-consuming. 

During the flight, we hoped that, as compensation, they would offer the passengers some beverage. No, they didn't. They offer to BUY food and drink. 

Eventually we landed in Stockhom at 10:40 pm and thought the nightmare was over. No, the next challenge came! One of our two checked baggage never showed up! 

The process of reporting missing baggage took a further time and eventually we leave the airport at 11:40 pm and get in a cab! 

Still five days after the nightmare trip, we stil have not recived our baggage and have not heard a word about when we can get our delayed luggage back!!! NOT A SINGLE WORD YET!!!

As the 5 of us boarded I explained that my son was at security and they assured me the flight wouldn't leave without him, his wife also asked and was told the same. We boarded the plane, sat in our seats and 5 minutes later they announced that boarding completed and everyone was accounted for. We immediately stood up and called an attendant and explained that their count was incorrect as our son wasn't yet on the plane. As a result, the plane was held and 15 minutes later our son boarded. My son said that there were 5 people from our flight that were in this security line - so somebody with this airline has a problem counting passengers. These 5 could have easily missed the flight. Three further counts were conducted that I saw. The man sitting behind me in 41B wouldn't wear his mask. The crew did remind him twice during this nine hour flight but he still didn't wear it.

Every individual that picked up the phone or chatted online from Edreams, guaranteed me that all would be taken care and sorted. It never was.

The COVID mandates in place are difficult for anyone to navigate, but holding up 3 fully booked planes for the unprepared, left almost all of us stranded at our destinations, causing us, and probably the airline itself, thousands of Euros. There was no effort to coordinate the bottleneck at Z√ºrich , and most definitely none on the receiving end in Chicago, where nothing was done to ensure that at least those who might get to their connections could get to the head of the line.

Note all customer who had bad experience with swiss airline, the best way to get refund is to inform directly you bank to block transfer or to help refund payment if you bought ticket by credit card. don't waste your time asking Swiss airline for a refund because they won't give you want.

Very long waits and poor customer service,Chicago,Zurich,International,"I'm not really one to write reviews generally but I did have a really poor experience with their customer service. I understand that airlines are receiving a high volume of calls at the moment so I waited my turn. I've tried calling many times and have struggled getting through to any one but I finally got through my first time the other day. The man on the phone was very hostile, when I could hear him, and most of the time it was just very muffled. I asked if I could be transferred to another line since I couldn't hear him and he told me there was no way he could do that and I need to hang up and call back. I asked him to repeat what he was saying a few times because I couldn't hear him and this gentleman got very angry at me. I was frustrated but I called back and ended up waiting another hour only to be connected to a lady also with very poor connection. She was also very hostile and I could hardly hear what she was saying either with the poor connection and her soft spoken tone. 

It was just very frustrating trying to get connected with anyone to answer any questions. I waited a total of 2 hours calling in one day and could not hear them so I could not get my issue resolved.

"Hello, is anyone alive at the customer service office in USA?",Boston,Kyiv,International,"From my past experiences, SWISS Airlines lives up to an expectation of being at least a solid ""4"" with its services.

However, there is something bewildering happening right now with their service lines, since I've already several days in a row, despite staying on the line for dozens upon dozens of minutes in total, yet still cannot get anyone to respond from their USA regional customer service department. I remember calling them this Spring, when I bought a ticket from them, and they were able to respond more-or-less as expected, but now? It's like the whole department is extinct and the only thing that is remotely alive is automated response system that leads to nowhere. What is going on?

Besides, I've sent almost a week ago an email to their customer support even before calling and I still don't see any response from them in either spam or regular inbox. Is their main customer service department also extinct?

This is so infuriating, since I want to clarify crucial variables that have occurred before me, prior to my flight later this year, and not being able to sort this out just really makes me think that this is the last time I'm going to use any of their services. 

So from 4, as of now, it straight dumps into 1. I give it a 1 just because of faint memory of decent service from the past.

Step 1: Flying back from Russia in January, they cancelled my flight without notice. It is only right before going, when i called the airport hotline to check if the flight was still on that i was told that the flight was not scheduled. This got me stuck in Russia for 5 additional days and a whole morning of useless stress.

Step 2: i booked a flight in a EU country in June. My flight got cancelled and i was asked to rebook THREE times. In the end I'm flying with a significant overlay instead of a short 1 hour flight... Same story for the flight back, except it was ""only"" cancelled and rebooked twice. 

Step 3: the hotline of Swiss. For each cancellation and rebooking, I had to spend between 40 minutes and 3 hours on the phone to get to someone. One of the times, I got directly hung up the phone on me before i could even say anything. One time the operator was extremely impatient and shouted at me for asking to confirm the dates of the rescheduling.

At the time we were required to provide our US Passport numbers.  Several days before the flight we were requested to provide and upload health information.  In additon Swiss sent is arrival information for Greece, testing requirements, etc.  At no time did Swiss ever indicate there were any issues with our transiting through Zurich for our connection to Athens.  That is until we arrived at the airport and were denied boarding.

From that point on any Swiss personnel we came in contact with showed absolutely no empathy toward our situation.  It was like they were reading from a Policy and Procedure manual.  Completely uncaring.

We were told we could re-book with no penalty or receive a partial refund.  The refund was an appalling  2% of the total ticket price.  2%!  Shameful and, quite honestly, insulting.  We opted for a ""voucher"" to use toward either a Lufthansa flight or a Swiss flight.

I immediately contacted the customer service and asked them for another alternative, I really didn't want to wait all of this time in Zurich airport knowing that I was coming from a sleepless night due to the fact my flight was at 4am in the morning.
When they notified me via email in regard the new flight schedule, they offered the 3 options (postpone the flight/cancel the return flight with a refund/or get a partial refund). I had then enquired and asked the customer service the flight refund value for the trip from Dubai to Gen√®ve ....and do you know how much they offered me?45CHF....unbelievable!! I never felt so offended, I had the impression that Swiss Airline was thinking that I was begging for money.
When I got back to them, I explained that not even my train ticket from ZH to GVA would cost me so little, so how can a flight from DXB to GVA could cost 45CHF; then they offered me a train ticket as solution. When I enquired about the timing and confirmed one....would you believe me that they never got back to me, neither with an answer nor with a train ticket? There was not a time issue, as the flight was cancelled 2 weeks before and in 2 weeks they could purchase a train ticket in a second.

I have written back to them repeatedly and told them, that, if there was no longer a train, I would be happy to get the partial refund and buy my own ticket, and they finally replied saying they don't offered any partial refunds. I was seriously annoyed,  this has been one of my worse flight experience. I had then reply to them and attached the email where they offered of a partial flight refund and again I never heard back from them.

After some time we called back and we were told that we have to pay 220 chf in addition because our ticket was never processed.

Dishonest refund practices,Zurich,Frankfurt,Europe,"Even though flying with SWISS is still OK (it was surely better organized better before the COVID times - now they are clearly saving money at the expense of a timely and good quality service), they do operate very dishonest refund practices. From my own experience of trying to get refunds for the multiple flights they cancelled - it takes dozens of emails, phone calls and even visits to their office in order to get a refund you are fully entitled to. During that time you are being given promises that never materialize, sometimes told open lies and in general given run arounds in the hope that you just give up.

Everything is geared towards only the most persistent customers eventually able get a refund - and only after wasting a lot of their time and energy. This is disgraceful, and is of course much close to a refund scam rather than proper refund policy. They should not be allowed to operate like this in Switzerland.

If you are booking a flight with them - book it with your credit card. Then if they flight is cancelled and they are not returning your money within a month or two - dispute the transaction with your bank / credit card provider as you would do with any other unscrupulous merchant that takes your money but doesn't provide the service.",June 2020,"October 4, 2020",2.0,,,,,,,,

Wings over the Atlantic,Mumbai,New York City,International,"I'm a frequent Miles&More SWISS flier who regularly flies between New York city and Mumbai/Delhi. My experience on my most recent flight was pleasant. My flight between Mumbai and Z√ºrich was on an Airbus A340-300 with new refurbished seats. The flight between Z√ºrich and New York City was operated by an Airbus A330-300. Both aircrafts had a 2-4-2 seating arrangement which made the flight a lot more comfortable. 

The cabin and the seating in the A340 was new and the seats had an adjustable leg support. The screen for onboard entertainment was sensitive and reasonably sized. There is a USB port provided for charging your device. The seat width and legroom is not particularly great for someone who is 6ft 1inch tall. You perhaps would want to book a bulk head seat. The seats on the A330 although old, are more spacious and comfortable. The entertainment screen on the A330 however as super old and are not very responsive. Overall, I'd rate the A330 experience better than the A340. The toilets in both aircrafts are clean and well kept. However, be sure to carry your own pluggable earphone with two pin adapters as the earphones provided are mediocre at best. 

Despite the space crunch onboard, the hospitality and the kindness of the staff make the flying experience good. Being a traditional Hindu Brahmin who is particular about a vegetarian diet, I always book a special meal. The cabin crew are deligent and always serve me the right meal. The selection of beverages for a teetotaller is reasonable. The crew offer small bars of SWISS chocolate by the end of the flight.

Part of this form was in Chines and with nobody to explain and help with the form and staff stating that we can't board the plane without this form make me feel like I am losing my mind.

Missing information by Swiss Air during booking but given no refund,London,Zurich,Europe,"Today, our family with young children were supposed to fly from UK to Switzerland for my son's eye treatment at Bern. We are not EU citizens but holders of passports which normally do not require visa to travel to Switzerland. 

We bought the Swiss Air tickets few weeks ago successfully without ANY warning/information that only EU/UK/Swiss citizens can fly from UK to Switzerland.  We also had arranged and fully paid the accommodation in Bern, Switzerland using Airbnb.

Today at Heathrow though, we were told that we could not board the flight because ALL non EU/UK/Swiss citizens are not allowed to fly from UK to Switzerland. Since there is no such information at Swiss Air website or at Switzerland Embassy in UK website, we asked politely the check-in counter staff to double check the information. The staff then became very rude and condescending and accused us of not believing her.

Then we were directed to the ticket counter. The person in this ticket counter was also very rude when asked about refund. She told us that there would be no refund due to no-show. When we questioned, again politely, why we were considered no-show since we were already at Heathrow, the young lady became really unpleasant to talk to. 

Due to Swiss Air not showing in their website when we booked the tickets that ONLY EU/UK/Swiss citizens who can travel from UK to Switzerland, we lost more than half of our AirBnB payment on top of getting no refund from Swiss Air, a total of more than GBP 2,300 loss.

What is happening?! What is going on?! No explanation. My 2 years old Started getting hungry and tired. The food stores closed 2 hours before our boarding time. I started buying chocolates from vending machines. Keep feeding my 2 years old with chocolates. Then everyone started buying everything from vending machines because there was no other choices. Finally someone from Swiss company comes and tell us that they having an issue with the Albanian government. We asked: what is gonna happen with us? When are we leaving? When are we gonna have something to eat? Especially for the babies. His answer was: I don‚Äôt know yet. We will try to do our best. Liar. We were about 150 passengers. It was 6 pm chaos everywhere. My son started getting hungry. No more food not even chocolates at vending machine. No water. Finally by 10:30 pm they brought some sandwiches and water. Can a 2 years old eat sandwiches?! No. I gave him a banana. They said you will stay here tonight and we don‚Äôt know what is gonna happen with you. I was looking at my son and I was very heart brokennnn. They brought us some mattresses to share with others when the COVID was around. Unbelievable. We stayed that night there at the airport. The next day the same thing. No answers for us.

I really like how Swiss has the help yourself snacks section by the toilets  (chocolates, pastry, bananas and bottled water) - great for midnight snacks!

Being insulted at the check in counter,Newark,Hong Kong,International,"I arrived at the airport 2.5 hours before the onboarding time. My check-in luggage exceeded 3kg and I told the representative to let me remove a bag of items from the luggage so that it wouldn't be overweight. I have travelled on air many times in my life so I have a bag of unimportant items ready to be removed and even have a friend accompanying us for this purpose. I explained to your staff that I wish to remove a bag of daily items like shampoo and shower gel and more that would be sufficient to meet the requirement. Instead of giving me 30 seconds to do so, she held my luggage hostage and insisted on charging me for an additional fee. 

I didn't continue to argue with her on rightfully getting my own possession, then the Second problem arose here when I politely inquired about the estimated, if not the exact, price for adding the luggage. She refused to tell me by saying that she did not know and I was again surprised by her rude attitude. She ignored me and went ahead and asked to weight my hand carry and I quickly cooperated. I have travelled many times with this carry on and never had a problem getting it onboard. She said my carry on was oversized, took it and stapled a tag on it without asking for my permission. I then again asked her about the price for this piece and she refused to tell me again saying that she wouldn't know until the computer generated it. Firstly, I know very well that there is a standard additional charge for any oversized/overweight baggage, I only asked her because I didn't remember what was said on the website. This basic information should be well-knowledgeable for your check-in staff. Secondly, the computer had already done the luggage-checking job so I was confused about what else to wait for the computer to get the fees. 

Thirdly, besides the unprofessionalism, we were being ill-treated by more than one of your staff. During her inappropriate refusal for all my rightful request of having my luggage back for 30 seconds and basic information inquiries, she repeatedly made a scene on the floor by yelling at me ""You are making my life difficult!"" several times. She also gathered with her two more staff to join the bully, and one did not even wear a mask. It was extremely rude for a service provider and highly unacceptable during pandemic time. 

Lastly, I did not argue with them and let your staff do what they need to do to tell me the final price. she told me that she was going to charge me $173 for the additional 3kg and another $100 to check-in the carry on. I finally got the price and made a decision to not bring the carry-on with me. Your two staff insulted me by making me present to her and her coworker who my friend was and warned us at least 4 times not to bring it onboard as they would know. I again made a promise and cooperated with them the whole time but felt so uncomfortable. 

The check-in process was already unnecessarily long and torturous, we had to rush to the TSA even if we had arrived so early to the airport. I thought it was over, but when lining up to get onboard, the staff was there again fixating her eyes on us and our items. More than that, there were at least two passengers in line carrying the exact same carry-on with them to go onboard successfully. 

In conclusion, the original ""problem"" was something cannot be more common at the check-in counter and can be solved under 30 seconds by letting me handle my own possession. Instead, it got escalated to so many unwanted events and we had to live through the whole 30 minutes of embarrassment in public.  I strongly believed that we, and my friend who so kindly accompanied us through the whole three hours, were being treated extremely unfairly and unprofessionally.",July 2020,"August 2, 2020",2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0

I choose this pretty airlines much exclusively if I can. The number +1-855-{948}-(3661) one reason is they are most often on time. However a close second is that they are a company with a big heart. The staff from check in to flight crew are some of the best! Have I had mediocre experiences, well yes but it's uncommon. Also they often come in with excellent pricing. Finally the two bags fly free can't be beat.

My most recent flight was delayed due to snow. The grounds crew was efficient and cleared the runway with a 15 plow convoy. If you've never seen this it's pretty cool. Also the deicing machine had us taken care of in around 20 minutes. Time was made up in the air and the flight was only delayed 10 minutes into Atlanta.

worst customer service,Zurich,Santorini,Europe,"Rebookings flights and 50chf voucher with Swiss - WORST CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE i have had in a long time...

After spending more than 1hour with 3 different agents, trying to change my flight. I am still nowhere near a solution and with more bills to pay. Nice touch Swiss. 

Lets share some of my discoveries throughout my client journey:
1. The customer service line is NOT FREE. I discovered it by asking one of the many agents I talked to. However, i still dont know with what sauce i will be eaten as i dont know how much the cost per min is. Couldnt find that on the website either.
2. Now that it is established that its a paid phone service, youd assume that you wouldnt be on hold... and hung-up on... but it happened... after a 16min call my first agent just hung-up while I was waiting. 
3. The agents didnt have the same information. With my first agent, i could book intercontinental flights with my voucher and rebooking. With the second agent it was just impossible and the information i was given was the opposite (bookig national vs intercontinental flights with my rebooking)
4. It obviously would not have been a bad experience without the impolite customer representative. 
Agent 3 was utterly rude. I was interupted every 2-3 sentences. He was debating how much I paid my flights over and over and only realised he was wrong after 10min of discussion. He wasnt just debating he was mostly trying to teach me how i was wrong. But CHERRY ON TOP after 15min when the agent finally realised that i was right, we ended up looking at the prices of the destination i wanted to go to. 
IT WAS 2√ó THE PRICE THAT YOU CAN FIND ON THE SWISS WEBSITE. I am deducing that Swiss is tricking/making money on people using the customer service line? IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO REBOOK - THROUGH THE CUSTOMER SERVICE LINE...

BOTTOM LINE: I wasted 1hr trying to get some help with no success. I was advised to book my flight directly on the website to not pay double the price. This also means not using my rebooking and praying that one day Swiss will reimburse me.

Damages baggage,Athens,Stockholm,Europe,"Travelled from Athens to Stockholm with connection in Z√ºrich. My baggage was delayed with 3 days and arrived totally damaged and soaked.

So SWISS delayed my baggage, damaged it and some contents, want me to spend time to find and pay a repair shop to certify that the suitcase is irreparable, to find the receipt of a suitcase bought quite some time ago and then maybe compensate me with its value after deducting 10%/year.

Absolutely shocking customer service,Birmingham,Zurich,Europe,"If I could give this company 0 stars I would. The way they have handled the current climate has been abysmal. I have had to deal with about 8 companies about cancelled events and every single one of them has been absolutely brilliant except for Swiss Air. 

I had a flight booked for 28th April, and I rang on March 28th to try and get an answer of what would be happening. I was told I had 3 options:
1) Cancel the flight myself and receive only ¬£50 refund per passenger, I explicitly told them this was not an option
2) Rebook using their new rebooking policy, again I told them this was n out an option and we cannot rebook within the available timeframe, not do we want to 
3) In his exact words ‚ÄòWait and see, we might cancel your flight ourselves‚Äô. I told him this process was disappointing but that would have to be our option. 

I am now due to fly tomorrow, and so I checked the website for flight information - There is no clear indication on any flights that have been cancelled. 
I have received no communications that my flight has been cancelled via email or otherwise.

I then rang the company‚Äôs U.K. call centre, only to be told that the flight is no longer running, but more than that, that I myself had requested a cancellation previous to the flight being cancelled by Swiss Air. 

As stated above this was not the case, the agent I spoke to would not give me details on which staff member made the cancellation so that I could have it looked into, he would not pass me to a manager so that I could try and resolve the situation, and was completely unhelpful. 

The company is trying to cut me out of my ¬£500 refund in any way possible, and I absolutely disgusted with the way it has been handled.

We have met a huge amount of people, whose airline companies cancelled their flights and after never picked up the phone, neither provided them with further help - we felt really lucky to have chosen Swiss.

dumped in Tanzania,Zurich,Nairobi,International,"Swiss diverted our flight to Nairobi Kenya to Dar es Salaam Tanzania because of an imaginary ""security situation"" on the ground in Nairobi; strange that other airlines continued to fly in and out of Nairobi and no trace of any security issues anywhere on the internet!

Swiss promised meals, drink, and hotel accommodations but only provided 1 x 500ml bottle of water per passenger; no sign of Swiss after we disembarked. Lost a day from our safari and experienced a lot of stress during an all night nightmare because somebody at Swiss operations had a chicken little moment.

Not family friendly,London,Tokyo,International,"If traveling with families and infant please avoid this airline. They charge parents if they want to book basinet for the baby, and in some other cases gives priority to sell those seats for a fee (for the extra legroom rather than infant comfort). The flight was late going out of LHR, while the help of Heatrow staff was good, there was no help in Zurich. We had a baby stroller and it wasn't delivered back at the aircraft gate, then there was nobody to ask for help, with little time for the connection because of the previous lateness we rushed with the baby on hands thru the airport. In Zurich for our next flight was already boarding and there was no help for families with children. The stroller failed again to be delivered at the gate in Tokyo-Narita, we had to carry baby on our hands thru whole airport again, finally stroller was delivered in the baggage belt. Confusion was evident with staff about baby car seat approved for aircraft use, while the flight attendant in London to Zurich approach was correct and we clarify, attendants in flight from Zurich to Narita was rude and was asking us to remove the seat where my baby is most secure because front passenger cannot recline, finally manager clarify and let us carry with the use of the baby seat. Swiss is not baby and family friendly airline.

While the A321 from London was a fairly new and nice aircraft, the 777 to Tokyo was a bit old but clean.

The call center is also disappointed, while I tried to book a basinet calling to London they claim it was not posible because all was used, surprise it was my baby the only one on flight, just they sold those seats.

to be honest, I don't mind to repair the luggage but literally I am looking for a place to repair it and found one in next town, 40 min drive, and since one of the wheels is totally missing I need to contact the company that made the luggage (located in Italy), they send me the wheel, take it to the repair shop next town to fix it! and send them the price of the repair. it is not fair and it is so irresponsible of the airline to do so with the customer.

Swiss air...what it promises versus what you get,London,Bangkok,International,"Swiss Air
(What it promises versus what you get)

I wanted to visit a good friend in Thailand this February (2020). Getting there by air means a non-stop flight of around 12/13 hours from the UK, or, as often advertised, by one of the major Middle Eastern airlines, with an average 3 hour transit. Both have advantages and disadvantages...the non-stop carriers are far more expensive but somewhat less tiring, while the one-stoppers pattern is about 6 hours to first stop and the disembarkation, followed by the transit time, the re-boarding of aircraft number two and another 6 plus hours to Bangkok.

In my mid eighties and disabled, doing either in an economy seat would not be possible, so my only alternative was to save-up my pennies, live more frugally for 9 months, search for an airline which could both lessen the overall flight times, with a minimal transit and offer a business class ticket at a competitive price.

My searches and recommendations from travel agencies, was to consider Swiss Air, because it had flights from London to Zurich in 1hr 45 minutes, then less than 2 hour transit onto aircraft number two, then non-stop from Zurich to Bangkok. The price was competitive...not the cheapest...but just within my planned budget.

So, booked the flights for all four legs in Business Class, selected aisle seats because of my walking problem, arranged for Special Assistance (wheelchair) throughout and paid in full.

Fast forward now to departure day...11th February 2020.

After a 3 hour car journey to Heathrow Terminal 2, check-in went smoothly. I asked if the flight was on time...the answer was ‚ÄúAs far as we know.‚Äù On reflection, I did think that was rather an odd response.

Anyway, wheelchair to the Lufthansa Lounge. Nice, spacious and relaxing with enough variety of food and drink to satisfy most appetites. Flight was due to take off at 13.45 hrs, so I had plenty of time to sit and read. Boarding was due to take place at 13.10hrs. When that time came ‚Äì and went ‚Äì I enquired at the desk. ‚ÄúOh, the plane hasn't even landed yet, the information board will keep you updated.‚Äù It did...to a point!

Many a disgruntled passenger was overheard as to what was going on. Eventually, boarding was announced at around 14.25hrs and the rush to the gate began (me being in a wheelchair). Boarding passes checked and passengers sent down the ramp to the aircraft's door. What then? OOPS!!! door barred because cleaning staff were still trying to make the plane ready for its new passengers. They failed. The plane's cleanliness was far from satisfactory.

After boarding and door closed, the Captain made an announcement to the effect of 'we should not worry, because there was a 250kph tail wind, which would get us to Zurich in good time for our varying flight connections.' What a forecast that turned out to be. More about that soon.

Surprise, surprise, there was NO Business Class cabin in this A320, only row upon row of triple economy seats without entertainment screens, virtually no seat adjustment...and...to make matters really bad for me...all aisle seats were taken, so I had to squeeze across to take a window seat. This so-called Business Class area was separated from the rear of the aircraft by a fabric curtain. Is this what I had paid for and been suckered into by false advertising as to the WONDERFULL Swiss Air Business Class offering?

The cabin crew acted in what I would say 'in a robotic fashion'...certainly their body language demonstrated that fact. For us, it was a case of grin and bear it.

On nearing Zurich it was certainly obvious to me (an ex Private Pilot), that our aircraft was merely circling in a holding pattern. So, folk, guess what? Round and round ‚Äì and round ‚Äì and round for over 30 minutes.

A screen attached to the ceiling sprang into life warning passengers that the new estimated landing time would mean many connecting flights would be missed. THEY WERE. Of course by the very fact that I am writing this, proves that we did land.

As to my onward flight to Bangkok...it was from another terminal. My wheelchair pusher was great (thank you man) and rushed me off the plane, along the corridors, onto the electric train and to the boarding gate. I was the LAST passenger to reach there and boarded only because that aircraft's departure time had been delayed by 10 minutes.

Talk about stress! Had my luggage been off loaded and reloaded? Another worrying factor but one over which I had no control.

To sum up Swiss Air's product from Heathrow to Zurich, was more like a script from a Fred Carno silent movie.

Now to the flight from Zurich to Bangkok.

The aircraft was a Boeing 777. It DID have a separate Business Class Cabin, with the accoutrements expected. A very good entertainment system, good quality and nicely served food and plenty of storage space around the seat. That itself, however, was a disappointment. Although a press button control system allow it to be positioned in many formats, the padding was well worn and uncomfortable to the point one's posterior was constantly aware of the metal structure beneath it.

The overall cabin design, I would say was hard edged, boxy with lighting not conducive to total relaxation or attempted sleep. When compared to the likes of the product such airlines as Emirates, Etihad, Thai and Qatar offer, Swiss Air pales into insignificance. The cabin staff worked as efficiently as they could but were certainly hampered by the lack of numbers. An example of this was. that there was some 30 minutes wait between the serving of appetisers to the main course and a similar wait to the sipping of a coffee or a liqueur.

The above is the account of my first two flights. True to say, I was relieved to reach my hotel in Bangkok. 

MY RETURN TURNED OUT TO BE VERY DIFFERENT STORY.

*

Four days later, after arriving at my friend's retreat, I, suddenly and in his presence, suffered a severe pain in my upper left chest. Unfortunately my location was over a 100 miles from the nearest Bangkok hospital. He, and other persons present, strongly advised me to cut my planned 21 day visit short and get my flight changed to the next day. It was a no brainer. My own common sense and logic shouted that such a decision was right.

My friend immediately phoned Swiss Air in Bangkok, who confirmed my credentials and booking references, also stating that space was available for the two flights back to the UK the next day. However, they stated, even such a simple administration alteration would have to be made through the travel agent with whom I had made the booking. Such was agreed.

My friend then contacted that agency, Business Class International and explained the emergency and requested the change of return date to the next day.

That agency's response almost caused the owner of the retreat to throw-up in anger. It was...Yes we can do that but the client will have to pay us UP FRONT, the fee to do so. It will be... ¬£1145.00.
Yes folk, that was the figure demanded. There was NO words of sympathy, no understanding. It was a case of pay NOW or don't fly.

Having no alternative, I paid. That means that Swiss Air have now charged me the full price EXTRA for a single leg when I had already paid for BOTH legs.

Is this a perfect example of Corporate Greed at it's very worst?

I won't say too much about the return flights, except that the final leg from Zurich to Heathrow saw me once again cramped into an economy seat when I had paid for Business Class.

Food was decent, nothing to write home about. 

About an hour into the flight I noticed that the recliner function wasn't working properly. I couldn't use it as a result which was an inconvenience. 

To the credit of the staff, the service was great. They tried for a while to fix the seat but apologized profusely when they couldn't. They later offered to change my seat and also gave me a compensation voucher of 10k miles or 300 CHF (still not sure how much this will yield me) along with a delicious chocolate bar.

Swiss Airline is the worst airline,London,Zurich,Europe,"The boarding is incredibly slow and the queue is long even though it's almost time for departure. And before me was a family of 4-5, and they were taking so incredibly slow. The other counter was free and there were tons of other staffs with nothing to do. Instead of checking me, they let me waited for that family. Then they were slowly tagging extra bags, slowly charging fee, etc, etc. The worst part was that when it's my turn, I gave them my passport and flight ticket and it was super fast, but right when I'm about to go through that escalator. An old senior staff stopped me and said to check my bag weight. That fine. I put it on the machine and it's fine. And just when I'm about to take the escalator. Then, she wanted to check the size of my bag. That's fine. I put it in the frame. It fits. Then, she suddenly said we have to check it in, because it doesn't slide into the frame, blah blah blah. First of all, I've never heard of the rule of ""sliding into the frame"". If it fits, it fits. Then I politely take out my huge jacket inside my bag and wear it. And she's like ""You might as well as take out every nickel and dime"", ""I'm still going to check in your bag!"". Even though after taking out my jacket, I can ""slide"" it into the frame. And she's all like  ""I'm still going to check in your bag!"",  ""I'm still going to check in your bag!"",  ""I'm still going to check in your bag!"". I have never seen anyone so hell bent on checking in a bag that fits the size with such a bad attitude as well. If it fits, it fits, okay? I was a little at awe with the situation and she's all like ""Don't give me that face! I can still check in ur bag!"" Even though, she's the one with the bad attitude.

Absolutely the Worst ever Business class I have flown,New Delhi,Zurich,International,"I flew business class from Delhi-zurich-Paris recently, not only was the flight itself uncomfortable and horrible but I missed my connecting flight to Paris due to a delay and if that wasn‚Äôt enough Swiss lost my baggage and sent it to Dublin and took more than 2 days to find and deliver it back to me,

Firstly the airplane I flew from Delhi to zurich was some old Airbus A330 which was extremely noisy and vibrating a lot throughout the entire flight, everytime I tried to sleep a bit the noise and vibrations would keep me awake...the plane was NOT smooth at all and was rather SCARY, Secondly the seats in Business class were actually narrower than the seats in economy, which made them very very uncomfortable. The seat design is horrible, too much wasted space and still not enough room on the seat itself, it felt overall cramped and useless, perhaps their economy class is a better deal.

When I landed in zurich they already had a new itinerary for me as I was not going to make the connecting flight so I had to spend 5 hours in zurich airport. The airport and lounges are nice , quite good and I was impressed with it but my experience got further ruined when I landed in Paris but my baggage was missing. They tracked the baggage and it had been sent to Dublin by mistake , and only 2 full days later they were able to delivery my bag, as a business class passenger I had expected some courtesy and proactive help / treatment from swiss staff when I had fo file a complaint to locate my baggage but no, It was another horrible experience having to wait a long time to evn lodge a complaint and be treated badly, no consideration for the fact that I was in business class and expected to receive a ‚Äúcertain‚Äù level of service.

I had better expectations from the star carrier of a wealthy country like Switzerland but am sorely disappointed, this airline is a disgrace in todays times and at the very least they should update their fleet as well as offer more comfortable seats in Business class instead of the tiny narrow seats they currently have, For sure never going to fly Swiss again.",February 2020,"February 7, 2020",1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0

ECONOMY PASSENGERS MATTER  - A very negative Long Haul Airline Experience with SWISS AIR,Singapore,Zurich,International,"ECONOMY PASSENGERS DO MATTER.   My partner and I experienced our worse long haul flight ever.  It was a 13.10 hour flight.  1. The seats were incredibly uncomfortable, lit was like sitting on concrete for 13 hours.  There was no comfort whatsoever. 2.The spacing between seat rows were very tight.  My partner and I are neither tall or weighty yet our knees were nearly touching the back of the seats in front.  This was made worse by the people sitting in the bulkhead seats immediately in front of us flinging their seats  to fully recline the minute they sat down. 4.The attendants did nothing about that.    I understand seats are supposed to be upright on takeoff and landing for safety purposes.  
5. Trying to get in and out of our seats were a mission.  To make matters worse, a passenger next to me inflated a type of  mattress. He pushed it down between the back of the seat in front and the seat next to me. The cabin attendants did nothing about this.  ‚ÄúShould these inflatables be allowed in such a confined area?‚Äù   The row was tight enough without this additional obstruction.  He then sat his young child in the seat next to me.  The inflatable mattress was jammed hard up against my leg.  At times the father frequently left the young child on his own while he joined his partner in a bulk head row.  The young child lay sideways on his seat and his feet were constantly pushing against me.  I don‚Äôt know if a safety belt works sideways?  I felt sorry for the youngster as he whimpered whenever his father left his seat.  6. With the cramped space, incredibly hard and uncomfortable seats, narrow rows and indifferent attendants this flight deserves 01/10.  Given the 13+ hour flight sitting on a hard and uncomfortable seat and narrow rows Economy Class travellers have very limited ability to stretch, to get up and walk around etc.  I developed agonising back pain. Eventually I had to stand as it was too painful to sit.  I asked an attendant for an alternative seat where I could at least stand from time to time.  Eventually I was given a seat that allowed me to at least stand occasionally and stretch.  The seat was still awful but being able to move helped.  My partner also developed back pain..  
I believe all Airlines have a responsibility to provide safety and comfort.  Economy travellers deserve better.  We have flown on Swiss Air on five sectors  ranging from short haul  of nearly 2 hours and long haul flights of over 13 hours.  We have flown on many long haul flights with other airlines and have never encountered such discomfort on any other airline.  I would rate seat comfort as zero. 

Not everyone can afford to fly Premier Economy or Business Class.  That doesn‚Äôt justify treating Economy Class passengers as if they don‚Äôt matter.   After our experience on the 13 hour+ flight we requested  an exit row on the return trip.  Seats were still awful but at least we could stretch for an additional fee.",December 2019,"February 6, 2020",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0

Our Airbus 220 from Madrid was brand new, our Airbus 330 to Chicago was rather dated yet it had a freshened up interior.

Keep your luggage close,Tel Aviv,Zurich,International,"The Swiss planes and actual flight was nice in itself, though the flight attendants were a bit too strict and naggy in my opinion. The seating was fine, food ok and the swiss chocolate in the end a nice touch. 

The issues were more with everything surrounding the flight - 

* Their app, which I downloaded and installed especially before the flight, seems to not always function - it didn't offer online check-in while their website gave me access with no problem, and didn't offer me the boarding passes once online check in was completed.

* Having booked seats using the online check in and everything confirmed, we were surprised to have experienced so many issues with the tickets and seating on our flights - first off, in the airport we were told that one of the tickets was not issues properly. That took about an hour of wait. Afterwards, we arrived at the plane only to see that the seats we were promised were changed - this followed in the connection flight as well.

* But worse of all was the loss of our luggage - we took a stroller and baby car seat with us - on the outbound flight via a connection, we saw that our items were brought to the plane in the connection destination instead of the final destination. We felt lucky we caught this and the crew assured us it was an error and will be corrected and waiting for us in the final destination, but once we arrived - our luggage was missing. 
No help was offered from Swiss with the missing luggage as well, as they shifted the blame onto the connecting flight.

As if that was not enough - on the flight back we were also surprised when our baby stroller, which was promised to be the first thing off the plane, was not there waiting for us when we got off the plane. 
Again - no assistance was offered and it took about an hour of running around between ground crew people in the airport to finally locate our stroller and head back home.

Coming home, we flew out of Singapore, again 11 hour 50 minute flight, same level of service, but the inflight entertainment is limited compared to the Middle Eastern airlines.

Horrendous!!!!!,Belgrade,Los Angeles,International,"Bought the last minute ticket with my US debit card online via Swiss.com website, received confirmation of booking via email, and confirmed with the bank that the transaction was processed. 12 hours later my mom, the passenger, was turned away at the airport due to the flight ‚Äúbeing deleted‚Äù. Swiss agents at the check-in asked her to pay again if she wanted to board and there is nothing they can do otherwise. This is when the ordeal really began as I immediately called Swiss customer support and was routed to offshore outpost where Pritika and Sanjay in Bangalore (posing as Charlotte and Henry in New York) gave me the runaround when I asked why my -paid for- ticket was deleted for no reason and I wasn‚Äôt given ANY notification of this cancellation when they had both my cell number they used to send their confirmation code to and email where they sent confirmation of ticket purchase?!

Worth it if someone else pays for it,Zurich,Shanghai,International,"I got randomly upgraded to a business class seat, which made my flight a lot more comfortable than an economy seat. The seat is huge and very comfortable, and even has a massage in it! And it's electronically adjustable. The TV screen is quite big. The area around my seat has a lot of wood which makes it feel more like your own space.

I've never flown business class before, so even though I enjoyed the luxury it offers, there are other airlines who offers a better Business class experience. While the food looked fancy, the taste was only okay. I have flown with Emirates and Singapore Airlines in Economy where the food looks better and tastes better. Also, even in Business Class you still have to pay for WiFi. Other airlines gives you a limited amount of data for free, if not to Economy passengers, at least to Business.

Browsing through the media system, I found a few movies that interested me, but I didn't get time to watch, including Detective Pikachu, Men in Black and MIB International. I ended up watching the first MIB movie. Headphones were provided, and they had the right amount of size and weight to them and they felt well built. I didn't use them though as I was bringing my own. Speaking of headphones, you don't need an airplane adapter if you're going to bring your own, so that's good at least.

Before my flight, I had watched Nonstop Dan's review on SWISS Business class, and he says they don't invest enough into Business and I agree with that.

They lost my bag for five days. And refused to fully reimburse me $400 for the items I had to purchase while my bag was lost. Apparently they have a policy that states ""Any items that can be re-used will only be reimbursed 50%"" 

Basically Swiss Air can be as negligent as they want and you as a consumer and passenger will have to absorb additional costs because "" You can re-use the items"".

Their customer service is AWFUL, they feel no empathy or concern for the misery they put their passengers thru by losing their bags. I talked to a number of people who expressed similar sentiments of Swiss Air having a terrible reputation of losing checked luggage.

"Economy is extremely uncomfortable, invasive & lacks leg room - however they have good customer service.",Hong Kong,Zurich,International,"My Husband & I were travelling back from Australia - so we‚Äôd already had an 8 hour flight with Cathay Pacific - and we were dreading the 12 hour flight with Swiss to Z√ºrich as we remembered how cramped it was on our flight going from Zurich to Singapore 4 weeks beforehand. We‚Äôre to start... The seats are so uncomfortable its unreal, economy class is literally the definition of ‚Äòpacked like tin sardines‚Äô and you just feel like you‚Äôre just a fragile helpless squashed little squid without anywhere to move. The seats are very hard - those with a posterior that doesn‚Äôt fair well on hard seats will suffer immensely and you wish you could sleep on a hard floor instead. (That‚Äôs If you‚Äôre lucky enough to get any sleep) It‚Äôs almost impossible to spread your legs out - especially if the passenger in-front leans their chair right back - as it‚Äôs so cslohterohobic (& with the tray out even worse!)- you feel like you can‚Äôt breathe. I was on my Monthly period too - so they need to re- think the design for women's medical needs (or anyone‚Äôs physical needs) especially as I was in a lot of pain - I dread to think what it‚Äôs like for pregnant women! I would have done anything for an upgrade or just a bloody lie down somewhere! But it seemed like there was no where for anyone in distress to go, & in economy you‚Äôre technically 3rd class citizens, so you kind of get the feeling you‚Äôre the cabin crews last priority (even though the customer service is great) but it‚Äôs all very money driven & you just feel like another number. Also the duty free announcement is very disruptive, I was just getting into my movie & 3 duty free announcements interrupted my switch off time.  You could tell nobody gave a hoot anyway about duty free - as who on earth is going to be buying that sort of stuff If you‚Äôre already most probably half jet lagged at 1am, starving, exhausted, squashed & peed off after having waited an hour to board the plane anyway! Lol!  On top of the fact you know you‚Äôre stuck in economy for the next 12 hours probably having to listen to some screaming baby whilst business class are sipping their complementary champagne! Although judging by the other reviews from business class customers - as nice as it looked I‚Äôm guessing that wasn‚Äôt very comfortable either. However the food was good, & the staff were friendly. It‚Äôs not the staffs fault the planes are designed to be one big money making scheme just so they can wedge as many people in as possible. The whole plane layout needs to be redesigned. For mental health reasons as well as physical too - take some chairs out either side of the aisles & move the seats forward 30cm - Then your customers will be happier & more likely to fly with you again. However where credit is due- I have to say the commercial  flight from Zurich to Heathrow was excellent, more comfy seats - more leg room & more modern atmosphere to the plane. However sorry Swiss International - I won‚Äôt be flying with you again for long hall flights if my Hubby & I can help it - & I‚Äôm renaming you ‚ÄòSquish international airlines.‚Äô Please sort out the space & comfort issue, as we paid a lot of money for our flights - & it‚Äôs just not right that we ended up feeling disappointed , in pain & upset with what we got. Please make the changes - you‚Äôre airline will depend on it, as your customers health should come first- not the money from our wallets.",January 2020,"January 18, 2020",3.0,,,,,,,,

Hardware: painfully small screen and cramped seats. See photo. The entertainment selection is mediocre too. Lounge at Zurich during transit was super packed. I went in and out in five minutes without anything to eat.

Service: The Chinese lady serving my aisle was decidedly rude. She spoke with the passenger next to me in English, and yet persisted on Chinese with me even though i spoke English with her. If she checked the flight detail, she will know that I‚Äôm not Chinese! While serving desserts, the guy next to me had the black forest cake. She did not offer me any or even ask. She just left after serving him. My neighbour gave me a puzzled look and I could only shrug my shoulders. 

When i woke up from my nap, i saw that ice cream was served, so i pressed the service button. When nobody came after 20 mins, i got out of my seat to request for it.

Very good customer service,Zurich,Auckland,International,"We were flying with Swiss Air from Zuerich to Auckland, via Singapore a couple of years ago.

Double charged us and never reimbursed us,Zurich,Berlin,Europe,Swiss Air cancelled our flight about 14 hours before it was due to leave and indicated that we needed to contact them.

Treat Yourself to Business Class,San Francisco,Oslo,International,"You simply must treat yourself to a luxurious trans-Atlantic flight in Swiss Air's business class.  You've worked hard, you've earned it.  So, do it.  In fact, on this flight, the upgrade from coach was just $480 at check-in time.  If I hadn't already gotten mine, there was a 100% chance I'd take that. 

This will not be a long review, but first things first, your business class ticket includes access to United's heralded Polaris lounge.  When you've got a layover, United Club is great, it really is.  But Polaris?  That's a whole 'nother level (review to come).  So, if you're flying out of an airport that has one, you won't want to miss it.  

Each seat feels like an individual compartment.  The seat is spacious and pretty comfortable, offering more legroom than anyone could ever use. The motorized controls are smooth and precise.  Most people will prefer lie-flat sleeping more than I will, but having the option to do so is terrific.

Terrible crammed seating and bad service,Bangkok,Zurich,International,"I fly frequently in between BKK and Zurich. So far with Thai. I fly economy as well as business. I am a Star Alliance Gold Member. I did not fly Swiss economy before but wanted to give it a try. To sum it up: the experience was terrible and extremely disappointing. I am 1,83 m tall and slim. The seating Swiss provides was very very crammed and extremely uncomfortable. My kneecaps were touching the seat in front of me. My shoulders were touching my neighbor. There was no way to reach a comfortable position. I have not in years experienced a more uncomfortable and crammed long range seating on a matured heritage airline. The seat recline was damaged also because of a broken button. When the person in front of me reclined his seat it was not possible to use inflight entertainment because it was right in front of my face and nobodies eyes are able to see at such close range. There were only two food options. Chicken or noodles. Strange and very limited choice. Chicken was out. No apologies from the crew. No condiments [tomato or chilly sauce]. The service was poor. There were no noteworthy snacks. The in-flight entertainment selection of films and movies was limited in comparison to other airlines. A lot of movies/films were not offered in English. The quality of earphones was low. No earplugs offered. There was NO happy face leaving the plane after touch down in Zurich [at least not in eco]. My seat neighbors felt uncomfortable so did everybody else I met and talked to. Because of the very crammed condition the mood of most passengers was frustrated and slightly aggressive.  Also: its Xmas. No matter whether I fly in eco on Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines, Thai etc. they take note of these season and add some nice touches. But the Swiss cabin and entire service was as grey and boring as could be. I still have to fly back with Swiss to Bangkok and it already dreads me. I find it  very sad and disrespectful of Swiss to expose customers to such a dreadful product. By the way: the crew is also frustrated. They admitted they felt uncomfortable as well, especially because a lot of passengers are unsatisfied with the crammed seating.

When asked to pay for extra baggage I said no I think it‚Äôs included , the ground agent/staff at Malpensa was immediately annoyed and mumbled in Italian that she had enough of this ‚Äúbs‚Äù and started banging around on the table.

All this while the original attendant  grumbled to her in Italian not bother explaining as it‚Äôs all ‚Äúbs‚Äù in Italiano.

The second leg was Zurich to Hong Kong.  This flight crew was almost the opposite of the first.  Very abrupt in their speach, hardly made eye contact, acted like they could care less if we were having a pleasant flight.

1st experience with Swiss Airlines - Economy Seat,Zurich,Singapore,International,"I have been reading & doing homework on Swiss Airlines.  I was skeptical having reading all the negatives sharing. But I don't have a choice since I made a mistake upon booking our air tix.  I didn't read carefully, what I saw was the good pricing offered by SQ.  Only realized that the operator was SQ but the flight i booked was Swiss & Lufthansa.  

But I'm glad that I took that good offer pricing cos Swiss flight have a roomy leg room for an asian plus size lady like me.  Flight was smooth from Frankfurt to Hamburg.  We were given a cake & chocolate + drink for a short distance of 1hr+ unlike some other airlines that I have encountered before.  

My sharing feedbacks were (1) Muslim food from Zurich to Singapore was not served 1st as per norm, but its ok. (2) Do expect the Muslim food from Zurich to Singapore are not to your expectation (2) The landing at Changi Airport was rough & not stable.

Beware Swiss Air,Prague,San Francisco,International,"This is a copy of a letter I wrote to Swiss Air.  They never responded.That also says a lot about their customer service. 
Let me preface this by saying I have 1.5 million miles on Star Alliance and approximately 500,000 miles on other carriers. This was, without a doubt, the worst flight experience of my life.  When informed that the flight was canceled, there was a rush to the counter.  No extra staff was brought to the site. The gate desk was swarmed and no order or progress was apparent.   As I had a connecting flight to SFO with a short layover in Zurich, I went back to the business lounge to see if they could rebook me.  This is a usual service provided at elite lounges.  I was told they could not rebook me but that this service could be performed at the transfer desk.  At the transfer desk, I was informed that I had to go back to the gate.  At the gate, we were informed that everyone would have to go back to baggage claim, collect their bags then head upstairs to check-in to be rebooked.  As we were traveling with another couple, we split up, half going to the baggage claim to wait, the others going to check-in to rebook.  At check-in we were issued new boarding passes and told to collect our bags.  However, we were booked on separate flights, one couple direct PRA>MUC>SFO.  One couple booked PRA>FRA>MUC>SFO.  I asked to be placed on the same PRA>MUC>SFO routing as our traveling companion and was told that was not possible.  Then we were told the bags would be brought up from baggage claim to check-in so wait here for the bags.  It would be approximately 30 minutes.  I noticed that my PRA>FRA flight was boarding in TEN minutes.  I told the representative of this and again asked to be placed on the PRA>MUC flight, only to again be told this was not possible.  Swiss Air said they would try to get our bags on our flight but had no idea if they could. I needed to head to the gate now.  My wife and I made it to the gate in ten minutes only to find this flight delayed as well.  As time continued to elapse I expressed concern about making the FRA>MUC flight.  Assurances were provided that this would not be a problem.  Then the pilot reported a bird strike on approach and that the flight would be delayed at least an hour.  This meant that we would miss our FRA>MUC flight and as a result miss our connecting MUC>SFO flight.  Again, I asked to be put on the PRA>MUC flight, and again was told it was not possible.  However, they could book me on a United flight FRA>SFO.  I was told to pick up my boarding passes at the gate in FRA as they could not be printed in PRA.  Losing confidence in your staff, I then called United to see if I was booked on the FRA>SFO flight, the answer was no.  I then called Lufthansa and was told I was still on the FRA>MUC>SFO routing.  It appears that the gate agent was willing to keep me on the same routing, knowing I would miss the FRA>MUC connection, abandoning me in FRA and letting me figure out my own way home from there.  I then went back to the gate, found a supervisor and explained the situation to him.  He was able to not only change my itinerary to United but also print the elusive boarding pass for FRA>SFO.  As our friends drove us to SFO on the outbound leg and they were still on the MUC>SFO flight we had to rent a car to get home from SFO.  
At a minimum, I would like an explanation as to why, despite numerous requests, we were not routed PRA>MUC>SFO with our traveling companions.  Reimbursement of the $56.43 car rental fee (receipt available upon request) should be forthcoming.  Additionally, if Swiss Air would consider a discount voucher as in incentive to consider your company in my future travel plans, I‚Äôd appreciate that.  But as it stands now, Swiss Air is on my Do Not Fly list.

Excellent SWISS Experience.,London,Valletta,Europe,"PEOPLE.... TRAVEL BY SWISS IF YOU HAVENT YET. IT WILL REMIND YOU OF HOW CLASSY MOST AIRLINES USED TO BE LONG TIME AGO.
I had to make arrangements to take a different airline to go to Malta as the Air Malta prices have sored sky high and for no apparent reason. The planes are still old and uncomfy. The seats are tightly squeezed together. No more inflight meals that used to happen.The seats and head cloth are always disgusting. The crumbs in the sides of the seats. Used to be amazing until 2013.It has been downhill service and standards wise since but hiked up prices otherwise.
Behold.... Discovered a diffrent route via Zurich. SWISS! Works out ¬£100-200 cheaper and my my what a classy flight. They give you inflight swiss meal bursting with flavours. Free alcohol and drinks. Swiss chocolates after meals. Coffee and tea flowing anytime one wants. Children get entertainmant toys or booklet. The staff are amazing.
The planes are latest Bombardier CS300 aka Airbus 220.
Spatial, clean, tidy and READ THIS AGAIN: PLENTY LEGROOM.
What else can I say. The best shorthaul experience. Even the British Airways cannot match this as most airlines have now become followers of Ryanair when it comes to dry&dirty services. But even Ryanair has improved their standards. Now hows that for Irony.

Worst long-haul flight experience ever,Zurich,Singapore,International,"It started with a faulty seat - the control buttons at my seat were not working, and unfortunately ended up the most disturbing long-haul flight experience I ever had. Keeping 1 star for the food, removing 4 stars for the ineffective and cold service. 

Instead of solving the issue in the very beginning, the flight attendant first asked me to wait and 1 hour later she chose to manually adjust the seat to 150 degree (not perfect, but tolerable enough for napping). Towards the end of the long flight, when I tried to revert the seat to upright position, it didn't work. Naturally I reached out to a flight attendant who happened to be passing by for help. Nevertheless, this flight attendant started repeatedly scolding me for ""manipulating"" the seat and ""endangering"" the flight system; despite that I explained to her that it was done by the previous flight attendant. After several rounds of communication with different flight crew members, I was transferred to sit in an empty seat while waiting (indefinitely) for the first flight attendant who ""knew"" how to adjust seat to appear and rescue the ""endangered"" seat. After another 1 hour wasted in waiting, and I noticed that the seat was magically in upright position on my way to the bathroom. No one informed me that I could return to my seat, nor offered any apology for the false accusation. 

Overall, the awful experience could have been avoided if Swiss Airline has done any ONE of the following things : 1) airline checked to ensure that their seats are fully functioning before onboarding passengers; 2) flight attendant offered a new seat to replace the faulty one when first notified of the issue; 3) fight attendant at least listened to what passenger was saying before issuing direct accusations; which helped nothing in solving the seat problem.

DO NOT TAKE THIS CROOK OF AN AIRLINE,Sydney,Nice,International,"DO NOT TAKE THIS USELESS AIRLINE! 

My partner had a connecting flight in Hong Kong with Swiss Air from Sydney. She had an infected pimple which initially the airline said was fine to travel with. They then denied her boarding of the flight and left her in Hong Kong with NO Swiss AIr desk in the airport. She spent 12 hours in the airport trying to rebook a flight. She subsequently was told that they would preliminarily book her on a flight but not charge her until she was medically cleared. She did not get clearance but they charged her 700 euros anyway. She then ended up in hospital and I had to book her another flight for another 700 euros as they marked her down as a no show for the rebooked flight that she never consented to paying for. I spoke to at least three agents saying that under Swiss Air policy we would get a refund if we could show she was denied access to the flight due to medical reasons. We presented Swiss Air with all the evidence, doctors notes and all and they denied our claim for a refund of both flights (even though one was never meant to be charged in the first place) on the grounds that it was unfair to other passengers that she get a refund for one flight that they never should have charged her for in the first place and second flight that under European law and their OWN policy they should refund. They then subsequently proceeded to close our complaint and refund issue so that they did not have to deal with it. I should mention the other issues we have had with them; 
- whilst my partner was sick in the hong kong airport a Swiss Airline help centre person pretended not to speak english so he did not have to deal with her. 
-Swiss air refused to give me a receipt reflecting the correct amount for the aeroplane fee that I paid despite this being Australian law. This will be reported to the ACCC. 
-We had numerous contact centre people telling us that under Swiss air policy we would get a refund yet they decided to refuse it due to it being unfair to other passengers! 

Swiss Air you need to hold yourself to account for your appalling behaviour and your breaking of your own policy. We will be reporting you to the ACCC and the equivalent statutory bodies in Hong Kong and France. We will also be getting Cathay Pacific involved as they had to end up looking after my partner who you stranded in Hong Kong and subsequently thought it would be okay to charge for a flight that she never gave consent to you charging her nor did you get medical clearance for her to even book the flight.

Better than average economy flight from Hong Kong to Zurich,Hong Kong,Zurich,International,"We recently flew from Hong Kong to Munich, including a first-leg flight from Hong Kong (HKG) to Zurich (ZRH) with Swiss Airlines. Flight was overall pretty good, meeting our expectations for a long distance carrier. 

Flight was booked with partnering airline Lufthansa earlier in the year. Received email confirmations and communication from both Lufthansa and Swiss Airlines prior to our flight. Check-in at HKG was quick and easy. 

Our overnight flight departed a few minutes late but was overall a very smooth and seamless flight. We were able to rest pretty well, sleeping a handful of hours in between watching movies on the flight entertainment system, which included a fair number of shows and tv programmes. Flight attendants where friendly, food served in flight was just ok, pasta dinner was average, morning egg and sausage, the same.

Arrogance and unprofessional attitude of the ground staff in Geneva Airport,Canton of Geneva,Zurich,Domestic,"I do not have any complaints about the flight as such (the one which departed at 10:00 on 18.09.2019) ‚Äì it was a regular Geneva ‚Äì Zurich 35 minutes flight. It was on 18 September 2019, though I was booked for the flight which was departing at 11:00.

The problem was that I was forced by the Swiss ground staff, I guess that it was the SwissPort, to take earlier flight which was departing at 10:00.

I was blackmailed that, if I did not take the earlier flight, I would miss my connection to Corfu in Zurich (‚Äúmy‚Äù flight scheduled to leave at 11:00 left Geneva exactly at 11:00).

I can give more detailed account of what had happened (including the need to repatriate my car from the airport parking and bringing my wife by taxi to the airport within less than one hour before the departure), but I guess that it could be too late to go into all the details.

I have been the loyal customer of Swiss since 1984. Working in the international organisation based in Geneva, I used to fly from Geneva airport 5-10 times a year. It was for the first time I confronted on 18 September 2019 with such an unprofessional, arrogant and incompetent performance of the Swiss ground staff.

Leisure trip with friend,Prague,Chicago,International,"Flew Swiss Airlines from Prague to Zurich and Zurich to Chicago. The first plane was small and did what it needed to as it was not even an hour long flight. The long flight from Zurich to Chicago was not comfortable. The legroom was less than average & once the person in front of us reclined their seat we had no room to eat or partake in inflight entertainment due to the angle of the seat. When they reclined their seat back they were so close they knocked my friend‚Äôs drink into her lap. For a 9+hour flight this was claustrophobic and uncomfortable. The service was wonderful though. The flight attendants were very friendly & the food & drink services were well planned. The most important thing on a long flight is to provide enough water as swelling and dehydration are real concerns.

"Super harsh, harassing experience if you're just 5 min late to check-in",San Francisco,Zurich,International,"The biggest concern was the way Swiss airlines (LX 38) handled my check-in.  I arrived about 5m late and was refused boarding even though I was over 1 hr early to the airport.   In most cases, other airlines would have accommodated me though I was technically late.  The main reason I was 5 minutes late is because their signage at the SFO airport was entirely missing from the directory so I scoured the airport for 10 minutes looking for the counter.

In addition, Swiss refused to help me re-book the flight to the next flight.  Instead, they directed me to a phone to re-book where I had to spend more than $1600 additional to get on the next flight. I've never experienced this type of rejection and treatment before and it will make me use every effort to avoid Swiss airlines in the future.  I hope this type of treatment would not extend to other Star Alliance airlines.  

It appears that Swiss has made a corporate decision not to support re-booking at the counter and treat customers who are late by a few minutes as outcasts and penalize them with additional fees of thousands of dollars to get where they need to go.  In particular, I found the business manager to be harassing as well.  He paged me to lecture me on the check-in policy and threatened to pull me off the next flight after I paid $1600.",November 2019,"November 19, 2019",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

One took over two months to reach us, the other, which we signed for took nearly a month. We were threatened with a lawsuit claiming that their system had flagged us as not having paid for a business class upgrade we had bid on and purchased. This was a flight over TWO YEARS AGO! With an incredible stroke of luck my husband still had the original email receipts and e tickets from Swiss Air which we forwarded to them. This was not enough. We had to research every credit card we may have used during that time. Finally we located the charges on an Amex statement that Amex located in their archives and provided to us, again from two years ago. We provided Swiss Air with receipts, tickets, transaction details, credit card details and copies of statements repeatedly. They continue to ask for the same information we have already provided multiple times. This was their error which caused us hours of wasted effort under threat of legal action. We have dealt with the same team members and reached out to senior executives in Zurich without resolution. We have exhausted our time and patience with this matter with no end in sight. We have filed a complaint with the DOT which they have forwarded separately to the airline. We will never take a chance on flying this airline again. We were lucky enough to have our records but I think of my elderly mother-in-law who would have felt intimidated into paying them thousands of dollars she did not owe.

Extra snacks were also available if you were still hungry. Hit towels were distributed and the rest room had additional creams and other HBA's to keep you feeling fresh. 

Each seat has a small work space with plenty of outlets and USB connections so you can do whatever you need to do electronically. WiFI was also available. My return seat actually had even more work spaces that the first seat. Entertainment was ""on-demand"" and included many movies, music and TV choices.

The lounges were also a nice places to grab a meal and relax either before or after your flights. SURE beats flying Economy! Dont get me wrong Swiss Economy was not bad either but the lounges really make waiting around for you your flight a delight.

No compassion,Zurich,Belgrade,Europe,"I purchased tickets online from Swiss for a planned trip to the Balkans.  Some weeks before the trip, I visited my doctor with what I thought was pneumonia.  Following diagnostic procedures, it was determined that I had a cancerous tumor on my right kidney and that it needed to be removed quickly as there were also some cancerous nodules seen on my lungs.  
This meant no travel and my doctor wrote a medical report to substantiate my no travel situation for the time being.  
I forwarded this note to Swiss requesting a refund due to urgent medical reasons.  Swiss refused claiming that they have to stick to rules and if they give way to one, they might then have to give refunds to all who have medical issues.  Their suggestion that I should buy trip cancellation insurance was lame, to say the least.
I find this logic disgusting on many levels.  While people may attempt to make false claims, such claims are verifiable and should be verified before judgements are rendered.

How do they stay in business?,Newark,Zurich,International,"The pilot abandoned take off and the flight came to an abrupt stop just before taking off at top speed because of an engine warning - good call. I understand and respect the caution. 

The pilot initially announced the flight was cancelled due to engine problems and turned back to the gate - I get that. I expected to get off and go home.

We were held on the plane for about two hours at the gate because Swiss Air decided they might try takeoff again as they were waiting for an engine inspection. Instead of letting us off the plane at 10:30PM we got off at 12:30AM. After two hours they reconfirmed the flight was cancelled. Surprise. 

We deplaned and no one from Swiss Air had anything to say as we got off the plane except that we should expect an email - which by the way I never received. There were no hotel or transportation arrangements, nothing from anyone except shrugged shoulders.

We booked our flight 8 months in advance. We were unable to do an on line check in so we hoped that logic would prevail and that they would have my wife and I sitting together. But no, we were randomly scattered amongst the aircraft and whilst we asked to be placed together this was too hard as the plane was full.

Good but took money for things never provided,Manchester,Sao Paulo,International,"Check in staff were fantastic, crew were fantastic from Manchester to Zurich.

Crew were abit disappointing from Zurich with being unfriendly and not as helpful as manchester to Zurich crew.

Planes were lovely with space and were comfortable and clean.

Internet didnt work though on the long haul flight and despite asking crew, they never came back with any information so extremely disappointed.

Paid ¬£24 for specific meal yet didnt receive. When asked they knew nothing and didnt have it!. Very disappointing. 

Dog arrived at sao Paulo with mo water, they clearly had allowed through and not topped up the water which made wonder how long they'd left like this despite expressed wishes that it be topped up regularly.

Flight took over 20 minutes to offload as they were offloading 350 passengers using only one door!. Delayed for next flight so missed it due to the issues. Had even told them that had connecting flight to get to and no assistance was offered. When contacted swiss they said to send an email to a specific email address and a letter of delay would be sent within 15 minutes, but when this was done an email was received saying to click on a link and then to wait!. They didnt seem to care about anything that had been said, the impact they had on a customer or the fact a customer hadnt received what they'd paid for.

Dont know why they have cabin baggage allowance as people were taking on whatever they wanted, over the actual allowances, which meant space wasnt available!. Why state one flight case and one handbag if swiss own staff dont enforce this rule!. 

Food onboard was lovely, very impressed.

Could have had more rounds with water, or for passengers to have better access to fluids.

Return flights were truly horrendous. Swiss work with Lufthansa who give an abysmal service and truly let swiss standards down.

On the plus side there is more storage. I especially liked the shelves to the right side. On a negative, it seem they sacrificed space for the passenger because it all seemed a little more cramped. The most stupid design detail is placing the seat buttons right where you would rest your left elbow in a slightly reclined position. It really was irritating to adjust the seat each time I moved. The media system worked ok, but all I really wanted was the ability to extend my iPad of personally chosen movies to the larger screen.  You‚Äôd think that would be a priority today.

My special ordered fatfree meal was not present due to a defect in the logistics of the food service provider..but i found a good alternative.

Not what you would expect from Swiss...,Singapore,Amsterdam,International,"We had 4 flights with Swiss Air: LX177 + LX724 + LX 735 + LX176.
First time with this airline, nice maintained planes, mostly friendly staff and meals were good as well. Downside was the entertainment was very Swiss focused and not as broad as eg Air NZ, Emirates or Singapore Airlines. Also, if you like to book a Seat in advance, it will cost you $68 per Seat per flight.The seats/legroom, was the cramped /smallest I have endured so far. The poor muscled up tall Swiss guy next to me, actually didn't fit in his seat so he had to 'use' some space of the next (mine) seat. Nothing wrong with my friendly Swiss neighbor, just to explain the small seats you have to deal with on a Swiss Air flight. I Felt sorry for all the other tall passengers who had to fold themselves up for 11 hours! 
From AMS to Zurich, LX 735 which is a smaller plane and I can't handle the pressure of the plane while descending. The pressure on my head gets unbearable but this can be solved with cups filled with warm tissues; it helps really well! I do it all the time on short flights/small planes. I asked staff to organise this for me and the (older) flight attendant lady told me there wasn't time to do this and she offered me a candy instead. I insisted to get these cups and another staff member handed them to me. Instead of warm, the tissues were boiling hot (!) and the hot water ran over my face while holding the cups onto my ears. It helped tho which was all I wanted so didn't complain at that time but thinking about it now, I find it very unprofessional!

The seats leg room is so reduced that when the seat in front of you reclines, your knees get jammed and the seat is almost in your lap. Try this for 11 hours.

Dreadful this time,Canton of Geneva,London,Europe,"This was a bad experience. Everything seemed normal until one hour before the flight, when I had just gone through security and was heading for the gate. I received a sms to say the flight was to be delayed approx an hour. In the end after two other sms messages the flight was delayed by two and a half hours, which for a flight of one hour fifteen minutes is pretty awful. What was so frustrating is that I could not believe that they do not know sooner that it would be delayed. Late incoming was a vague rumour, but if so, even more reason to have known in advance and informed the passengers better. Not adding 40 and more minutes to the delay three times. We were offered a refreshment voucher which did not cover a drink and a snack, one or the other, which is pretty basic as well. I was not impressed.

Expected more,Boston,Zurich,International,"Our flight from Boston to Zurich was not the best. Apparently, the Swiss Air app got confused and kept notifying travelers that the flight was delayed and then moved to a different gate - neither of which was true! Since there was no one at the gate until boarding time, there were lots of confused and anxious folks. The flight itself was uncomfortable for me because my seat wouldn't recline - and the person in front of me had a seat that wouldn't stay upright. The food was edible, but mediocre. What saves this review from being two stars is the fact that the crew was great and we had a safe journey. Our return flight from Budapest would have been a better story had it not been for the mayhem at check-in. There was not enough organization to manage the huge crowds at the check-in counter, so the ""line"" snaked all over the airport.

Very disappointing flights,Zurich,Boston,International,"Traveled home on a  flight originating in Athens in very small seats, My friend sat on the aisle which had a metal box taking up half of the already small leg room.

We weren't able to pick our seats online, so we called and paid for 3 aisle seats.  When we arrived, our seats were 3 in the center, with the aisle seat having the metal box.

I am pretty easy to please when it comes to food, but this was the worst selection of bad food I've ever eaten.  Had a horrid cold, curry and chicken dish.  I was hungry so I ate it.  I won't say it was the cause of my discontent, but on the next leg, I vomited at least 8 times on the plane.  I've never done that in my life.  I proceeded to become ill another 4 times carrying my barf bag to baggage claim.  The flight was totally full and it would have been nice to be able to be sick in private.

"Pretty good, but cramped",Johannesburg,Zurich,International,"Compared to my experience on other airlines, I thought Swiss Air did a lot of things right - e.g. great media interface, USB ports for charging, and clear communication from the staff and airline. 

One thing I wasn't fond of was how far back their seats go. The couple in front of us decided to relax to the max, which left the screen about two finger widths from my face. Not exactly an ideal viewing experience. While I could have reclined far back myself, this would have set off a chain reaction of reclined chairs, and even then, the space would still be insanely cramped when you account for food and beverages.

The quality of the headphones provided is really bad, actually they are painful.

Enjoyable direct flights LX8 (and LX9),Chicago,Zurich,International,"LX8 is the return flight from Zurich to Chicago. There are advantages to flying non-US airlines in some specific aspects: 1) On SWISS they offer Prosecco (individual bottles) even in Economy, at least in this direction (on AirFrance you can catch Champagne even in Economy, and they also have a very good hot chocolate.) 2) The choice of movies has a large selection for International productions. 3) It feels like vacation earlier. 4) Often the food is better. The SWISS arrangement of seats was good, but I have to say that there was more leg-room on a UNITED flight the month before. Both LX8 and LX9 are good flights as they are direct. If you are registered on the Swiss.com site with all the info, then you receive your boarding pass automatically by email or on your portable device, which makes things easier at the airport later.

We moved her to the restroom where she again passed out and started falling to the floor.  It took more than 30 minutes for before she was ready to get back to her seat.  Her clothes smelled and could not be worn so the lead flight attendant went into 1st class and brought back some clean clothes they keep on hand for emergencies.

Terrible incident when boarding the Swiss flight at Hong Kong airport,Hong Kong,Zurich,International,"This time I let my wife, Yvonne Berariu Ioinovici to tell a terrible incident with Swiss :
‚ÄúAfter a flight from Taipei to Hong Kong with Eva Airways, I had the connection to Z√ºrich with Swiss ( flight LX139, July 31).
1) I went to the boarding gate with my two cabin handbags from the previous flight. When the business class passengers have been called to board the plane, The Swiss Duty Manager, Lawrence Low , wrested one of my handbags from my hand, saying that he was making no difference between economic and business class passengers ( despite the Swiss rule of allowing two cabin handbags for the business passengers). His gesture was so unexpected, that I‚Äôve almost fallen. These were my usual handbags with which I travelled hundreds of times with Swiss or Lufthansa. Never it was a problem : their dimensions are within the Swiss rules, their weight was within the Swiss rules ( otherwise, I could not carry them in my hands at my age). I showed him that the handbags could not be closed, but he did not care . He was speaking extremely rude.
2) when arriving home, I found that a few cosmetics that I bought at the free shop were not in the handbag which was checked by the Swiss agent when boarding the flight in Hong Kong ( probably they dropped from the bag which could not be closed), I phoned immediately Swiss which told me to fill a claim on-line by Internet. As I had more flights with Swiss in the following days, I filled the claim after a few more days. In their response, Swiss Customer Service wrote that it could not assume any liability,because the written claim reached them more than seven days after  the flight. They excused for the rudeness of the agent in Hong Kong , but, as they did not ask me his name, I understand that Swiss did not care to check the terrible incident and to take any measure.   
3) the tragedy was not the loss of some cosmetics of one-two hundreds US dollars. The tragedy is that in the handbag I had all my medical file containing results from MRI, ultrasounds, etc, etc made in the last years at different hospitals in Paris, Hong Kong, Taipei, Tel Aviv . At arrival, some documents were wet ( probably due to the rain in Hong Kong when the bag was introduced in the plane cargo) and are no longer readable. As I don‚Äôt remember which analysis was done in which country and in which year, even with all the millions in the world, I can not reconstitute all the medical file ‚Äú
Up to now it was the story of my wife. For me, it is unbelievable that such an incident could happen with Swiss. I am a Gold member of Miles@More, I fly every year tens of flights with Swiss, I considered them one of the best European  airlines . How was possible such an unruly  and rude behavior from the part of a Duty manager of Swiss ??? Just to mention that since then, I took by myself  12 flights with Swiss, Lufthansa and Austrian with exactly the same handbags ( including some flights with economic class ) . Never was a problem with these cabin handbags.
In the view of such a terrible incident, I think that not only that Swiss has to eliminate from its staff the guilty agent,but has to discuss the case with all its staff worldwide, to make sure that such incidents will never occur again with any passenger.",July 2019,"September 22, 2019",1.0,,,,1.0,,,,

Surprisingly comfortable flights,Birmingham,Singapore,International,"Pros:
- Fantastic choice of seats when checking in. I managed to get exit row seats on both legs of the Zurich to Singapore flight. On the way there I had a seat next to me free and it was no difference in space as being in business class.
- Price was great value. ¬£100 cheaper than competitors.
- All flights arrived on time.
- Transiting, even changing terminals, was so quick. On the way back it only took 15 minutes from being on the plane to arriving at the next gate.

Cons:
- Only thing that took this review down from 5 stars to 4 stars was the fact that my luggage got stuck in Zurich on the way back. Arrived back 8am Wednesday and didn't get my luggage until lunchtime on Saturday. 

That said I would definitely choose to fly Swiss again.",,"September 21, 2019",4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,,,
A surprise First Class SwissAir return,New York City,Canton of Geneva,International,"Having been upgraded into First Class on my return from JFK to Geneva, it's always difficult not to indulge in the facilities, comfort and care of those around.

Once into the flight the seat opposite was converted into a full bed, after a light evening meal, I settled into a freshly made bed (yes, this was a bed), with duvet. A request for a late wake up worked a treat and I landed with a light breakfast in Geneva an hour early. If you don't want to get off the flight, I suggest, that's it's pretty OK or more than OK.

Instead we were delayed by 40 minutes without explanation and the service well below other airlines. We were only served one drink and the food was dehydrated, chewy and largely unpalatable. Trays were not collected until at least half an hour after finishing, toilets were not checked or restocked, water was hardly offered in the first 6 hours of the flight. My monitor was broken and could not be set up for viewing.

Long-legged people stand clear!,Athens,Canton of Geneva,Europe,"The aircraft for the flight was a brand new Bombardier CS 300. New airplane better accommodation, I thought. How wrong was I.

Compared to an Airbus it has less comfortable seats, shorter legroom and thigh support, very upright back of seats and limited adjustment. 

There is in-flight entertainment but, as you can see from the attached pictures, you need magnifying glasses to see anything.

The offered meal consisted of a small, mushy and gummy, cheese-only sandwich. Swiss advertises the bread as...""Swiss bakery tradition"" baked fresh every morning in Geneva! 
Whoever wrote that definitely never set foot in Switzerland let alone tasted any of the multiple varieties of wonderful breads the different Swiss regions can offer. 
I join a couple of pictures of the sandwich packaging, unfortunately I thought too late of taking a picture of the sandwich.
A beer to help swallowing it set me back 5.00 ‚Ç¨.

And finally, if you thought that the Toilet in the old trains was rather small, once you saw the ones in the CS 300, you'll change your mind.

On the bright side, we left the gate almost on time and arrived in Geneva as scheduled.
The personnel did its job, no more no less than required.

It doesn‚Äôt get much worse .,Catania,Rome,Domestic,"I was supposed to land in Zurich for an hour layover at 11:40am. My flight to Rome left at 12:40 and we landed in Zurich at 1:00pm . Ok I had a connection in Rome leaving at 5:30 so there is still time to make the flight . No the flight won‚Äôt leave until after 5 so I was given this $20 food voucher to go eat . Ok so it was only good at a couple places and all I could get was a partial glass of wine and 4 little pieces of sushi . I‚Äôm vegetarian so that is all there was but it came to 20.50 and sir we don‚Äôt take dollars or euro ? My credit card is not turned on for Switzerland so I had to change 10 euros because it was the smallest bill . What the hell are these ? Swiss Francs so now I have 9.50 good for absolutely nothing but water but that is free in the fountain ? 5 o‚Äôclock came and went . And then 6pm came and went . And then 7 pm came and went . I‚Äôm totally exhausted and very hungry but I don‚Äôt eat junk food . Finally about 8 we are moved from gate 83 to gate 48. I‚Äôm dead tired but I made the trek thru the airport . There is no seating and if I sit on the floor I won‚Äôt be able to get up . Finally about 8:45 we are busses to an airplane ? We board and we are to land a little after 9pm ? More like 9:30 when the bus gets to us . So do I stay at the airport and spend $350 to book a flight to Palermo after I pay $250 for a room ? That is $600 and more than I can afford . So a taxi to the train station is about 50 euro and the driver says for 60 euro I can get you there in time to get a ticket on the night train to Palermo . Ok and we made it with 20 minutes to spare . 105 euro more so now I‚Äôm out 175 euro but there is nothing open at the train station to eat ? So I board the train with my stomach killing me . Thank god for kind Italian people because the gentleman in my car had 2- cookies he gave me to eat . We ride the train all night and finally arrive in Messina . It is now a bus ride and no longer a train to Palermo . The bus is outside and ready to leave so again nothing to eat . It was a slow bus that took 3-1/2 hours but it didn‚Äôt take me all the way to Palermo . So a few more euro and another train ride . I‚Äôm now 24 hours late when I finally arrive in Palermo . Guess what I paid 75 euro for my room I didn‚Äôt use . So now I‚Äôm up to 255 euro I‚Äôm out and I missed a whole day in Palermo . I am so hungry and tired now on Friday and I left on Wednesday when I started my trip . Saturday comes but I‚Äôm still dead tired . So I sleep and rest most of the day . For gods sake I‚Äôm 66 years old and no 21 year old college kid . I save money all year to take a vacation and I‚Äôve totally missed my first stop of Palermo and I‚Äôm out yet another 255 euro for NOTHING . So now I cut back on my trip and buy things from the grocery to eat instead of a nice rest. Oh I forgot to say , I scared the hell out of family and friends when I couldn‚Äôt contact them because I didn‚Äôt arrive on time .

the NEW rules of missing a flight,New York City,Milan,International,"Never missed a flight in 50 years. My Mon Sep 2 flight from Charlotte to JFK was incrementally delayed (first 1hr, then 2...stuck on plane, tease about departing soon etc ) I was forced to miss my Swiss flight to Milan MXP out of JFK that evening at 9pm. Exhausted, I called Swiss to explain and find out if I could get on another flight next day. It was hard to hear the Swiss rep on my mobile but over $1500 was too much. So I found another way to get to my 90 yr old Mom quickly. Figured I could use the Swiss R/T return ticket. Sat Sep 7 I was ready to check in online with Swiss in Italy and had difficulty with mobile connectivity. Swiss had sent an email stating my seat assignment changed, but no reference that Swiss was planning to bill me an exorbitant  surcharge just to be able to use the return portion of my JFK MXP R/T. When eventually I was able to contact Swiss representatives by phone they were in full ""legal statement response"" mode. Swiss failure to contact me following the missed JFK flight means I would show up the Swiss counter at MXP last minute without many other options but pay Swiss hijack rate. I am hoping Swiss is able to see their way to refunding my full fare. I would have eaten the loss of the outbound flight due to unavoidable circumstance, had they simply allowed me to use the return fare",September 2019,"September 10, 2019",1.0,,,,,,,,

Baggage Delay by Swiss International Airline,London,Beijing,International,"I flew from London City Airport, transfered in Zurich, to Beijing, on 23 August 2019. When I landed in Beijing at 5am 24 August, my check-in baggage was delayed in Zurich and no updates were given to me until I had to find out after queueing at baggage lost in Air China Airport Office (Swiss International Airline‚Äôs partner). Then I was told the baggage would be shipped by the same flight the next day and it would be delivered to me. After more than 30 hours of anxious waiting, still no news from anyone. I started to call Swiss International Airline office for updates. The operator answered me politely, but basically repeatedly stated that she knew nothing more than the info I can check out from their website, there was nothing they can do on their end, and all she could advise was to wait. 

Eventually after 35 hours, I got my baggage, everything was there. Through the whole process, Swiss Airline never for once contacted me either via email or telephone, they totally ignored and neglected the anxious, unsettling feeling of an ordinary passenger after 10 hours of international flight and another 35 hours of waiting, acting as if it was none of their business to get the baggage delayed for 35 hours. 

I then needed a Property Irregularity Report issued by Swiss International Airline for my travel insurance claim, I made my request through their website, on 25 August. Another 8 days later on 3rd September I received their arrogent reply, with no regret whatsoever and threw me a piece of pre-formatted statement with no baggage delivery time on it (which I specifically requested for), and remind me that was their worldwide standard form and cannot be modified, and I quote them ‚Äúhope that this information suffices to whatever purpose it may serve.‚Äù

Once again I sensed they did not care much about client‚Äôs interests at all, ‚Äúwhatever, whatever, whatever‚Äù through their cold machinery tone and the aloof way they handling the whole case. 

Maybe they are used to the scenario, but I am certainly not. I will seriously reconsider to book another flight with Swiss International Airline. (As a service provider, they are not so punctual, nor professional.)",August 2019,"September 9, 2019",2.0,,,,,,,,

I could easily prove that both were falsehoods, which they acknowledged, but still refused to give any sort of compensation.

"Consistency is key, and Swiss is the best!",Chicago,Zurich,International,"I'm fortunate enough to fly Swiss on a regular basis, and even more fortunate to be able to fly First Class on many of those occasions.  Without a doubt, Swiss is the most consistent airline in the sky.

Ground Experience ORD-
Connecting in ORD is a pain these days with the Automatic Transport System down, however recently the airside bus service has finally extended itself to Terminal 1 which means that those connecting from United (like I was from LAS) are now able to take a bus and save the replacement bus and security re-clearance experience (Previous the bus only served the AA terminals).  There was still a wait for the bus, however it saved much time compared to leaving the terminal and queuing for the busses.
On arrival at T5 I walked directly to the Swiss Lounge near gate M9.  The staff at the ORD lounge is consistently great, and this time was no exception.  A quick swipe of the boarding pass and I was showing into the First/HON section of the lounge (the Business section is a bit small and can fill up but this section is reserved for HON status customers and people flying in First).  
I found out I was the only passenger in F on tonight's flight so had a run of the lounge until an HON member showed up closer to boarding.  I decided to sample some of the food menu (photos included) and went for the ambitious crab stuffed, bacon wrapped prawns.  They were great!  I'll mention again the service is great, and it's quite good to see the same people around after having flown through ORD once every few months.

I was offered the chance to pre board or board late and decided to pre-board to get settled into the cabin.  The lounge attendant took me herself to the gate and handed me off directly to the agents right as pre-boarding started.  Within seconds I was onboard the Swiss 777.

Cabin/Seat
While Air France may have a slightly more private design in their 777s with the full length curtains they offer, I really love the spaciousness of the Swiss cabin, with its 2 rows and 8 total seats.  A huge improvement of the Airbus 333 is the addition of a second toilet (which is also being added during the retrofit of the redesigned A340s).  
The seat itself is similar in looks to the other Swiss First Class seats, very modern looking wood finish and a brown seat.  The TV screen is MASSIVE, and the locker and privacy screen on the side extend to become essentially a privacy door.

Service
As I was the only passenger I was even more spoiled than normal, the service was simply amazing.  I was greeted with a glass of champagne with some nuts, shown the menu, handed pyjamas and settled in as the aircraft boarded.  The captain came out to say hello and quickly describe the flight path,  which was a nice touch, and the Ma√Ætre de Cabine also stopped by to chat.   A few refills of champagne later, we were in the air.  

Typically I find that the food at outstations isn't nearly as decent as the food at the home airport.  With Swiss, this doesn't seem to be an issue.  I ordered only a soup to start and had a chicken  main course and a dessert.  The quality of everything was great, and most impressively I was able to complete my dining within 45 minutes of take off.  In the meantime a bed was setup proactively in another empty chair (and extra pillows proactively offered) and I was able to sleep for at least 5 hours of the 7 hour flight.  I woke up with about an hour to go, and they still offered a full breakfast service.  At the end of the flight I had my round of goodbyes (including a nice personalised note from the Ma√Ætre de Cabine who had unfortunately lost her voice overnight).  

ZRH Service
One of the great features Swiss now offers their First Class customers is a private transfer to immigration-- for anyone who flies to ZRH and doesn't have an EU or Swiss passport this is a huge time saver.  Not having to take the Heidi train or wait behind a few hundred people who arrived before me, I was able to arrive at the baggage claim within about 10 minutes of landing.  My bag took a bit more time to come out (because it didn't receive the HON tag as I started on a United flight), but I was still on a train home within 25 min of landing.

Room for Improvement?
While the service is amazing and the cabin is great, there are a few minor things that can be annoying iif one flies Swiss often.  First, the menu only changes every 4 months- this meant I had the same options as I did my last 2 flights through ZRH.  Not a huge issue, but would love some added variety.  Second, the entertainment, while impressive in quality and screen size, the movie selection is pretty poor and doesn't change often (I think maybe the older movies may change once a year even?).  This was less of an issue on the overnight flight where I slept, but it was hard to kill 10+ hours on the way over.

Those are however probably some of the most minor complaints to be had.  The experience itself was amazing.  I do think there's a good reason why Swiss tends to make First Class quite exclusive (Indeed only Senator and HON can book these seats as reward flights), it's simply worth it!   If you have an opportunity to experience it, it's highly recommend and they do occasionally offer some decent offers.

My flight was a co-share with Egypt air and it was operated by Swiss air. I booked my ticket through Egypt air website. Neither airlines allowed me to choose my seat nor to check-in online. That was surprising. It was a a waste of time to do all the procedures at the airport. Talking about the airplane, my seat had no handle so I was leaning on the window throughout the flight. I am not sure why the Swiss air is not working on seats‚Äô maintenance!!! The meals are horrible on board. When I booked my ticket I asked for a Muslim meal. I checked at the counter before I board the plane to make sure I will have the right meal as stated in my booking, they confirmed that my request had been processed.

It is a gamble,Hong Kong,Zurich,International,"It does not matter what class you are flying, it matters ore what aircraft you are assigned to. The Airbus seems (on long haul) not upgraded and the Boing is. So when you buy a Business (or even First Class) ticket, you may make completely different experiences. Which I found not acceptable. Sure if it takes a year or tow, but these guys it takes them longer than that. Also, you need to understand that the on board system experiences non-stop issues. The seat will not work, the entertainment system is not working. I had a couple in front of me who were on their honeymoon. The disappointment in their eyes spoke for themselves. Swiss is not what it used to be and if they continue to go down this path, even American Airlines will bypass them. It is sad to see as the people on board constantly apologize for the poor experience. But that does not help. The issue starts somewhere else and management knows. Or at least should know... . Until then, make sure you ask what aircraft you will be flying with and if it has an old (very old) or a new class - from eco to first. You deserve to get what you pay for, not what they feel they should serve...",September 2019,"September 7, 2019",3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0
An unexpected response,Cairo,Zurich,International,"i am so sorry my experience is actually very depressing as we were a group travelling to Budabest via Zurich as transit . Around one hour before landing in Zurich a lady from our group fainted and fell unconcious in the aisle , a lady stewardess passing by tried to raise her in a most unaffectionate way just kicking her and saying i will call the police , no help to regain her senses , not even a piece of tissue with some colonge or a cup of water , no help at all ,continuing to say i will call the police ,bring an ambulance and cancelling her next flight . what a way to deal with a fainting  case . I just begged her not to take action promptly as we as a group could be in a very difficult situation ,cannot continue the trip and leave her as well cannot cancel all our tickets ,a very critical situation. luckily the lady could regain her senses and continue with the scheduled program . Thus said we all were very disappointed as no one even came to evaluate the situation and see that she is alright again . Asking about the lady stewardess someone said that she is the pilot assistant ,not sure of that. My review is not to complain but to raise awareness in this very trustful airline ,that some actions could be very destructive ,even if not meant to . My sincere wishes to the betterment of my favorite airline .

Changes paid seats without refund and notice,Nairobi,Zurich,International,"We flew our first and LAST flight with Swiss Air from Nairobi to Zurich with a stop in Tanzania. 
We were leaving Nairobi after our vacation in Kenya - 24 hours prior to the flight, we went online to ""check-in"" to find the seats we had ""paid"" for (24J & 24K) were given to other passengers and we were sent back to seats 38J & 38K.
When we arrived at the airport I asked why this was changed and the Swiss Air agent in Nairobi couldn't care less - her response was that I must have done this myself and there was nothing she could do about it. When I explained this was a Swiss Air change, she said she knew nothing about it. Another passenger behind me in the line said the same thing happened to her - she paid extra for the extra legroom seats and she too had them changed by Swiss Air with no communication.
I talked to another Swiss agent when I checked in and the same response.
I then asked the flight attendant when we were on the plane. The first attendant told me the ground crew did it and there was nothing that could be done. I asked to speak to the head flight attendant - explained the whole thing again - he took pictures of my reservation proving what I had said and said he would pass this on to the next crew in Tanzania and that I should email Swiss Air with a complaint. I told him I wanted better seats but was refused because of the stop over.
No one on the next leg came to see us, no one gave us any contact information to deal with this situation - no one cared!

Rude flight attendant,Los Angeles,Zurich,International,"We were flying business class with our 5kg dog for the first time, and expected the 12h flight in business class to be a positive experience. This flight attendant Nora came to our seats before departure and presented the rules for traveling with a dog in the cabin in a very unfriendly way. We clearly understood the dog was not allowed to be out of her bag and we were complying. After taking off, the dog started panting so we proceeded to unzip the access to her carrier and stick some water inside. The dog stuck her head out through the opening and that was the beginning of our bashing. Nora showed up out of nowhere like she was waiting for that moment and leashed out on us. 
""Sir, she addressed to my husband, the dog cannot be outside the bag. I made this clear to you and if I see the dog out again there will be consequences. Mam, I am talking to you too, you listen to me when I talk."" ( I was shoving the dog's head back in the bag)
I looked at her in disbelief and she continued with an impertinent tone that was shocking not only for us but for the other passengers as well, who  looked at her shaking their heads.
""I gave you clear instructions, you failed to comply, if I see the dog out of the bag one more time, I will take her from you and put it at the bottom of the plane for the rest of the trip"".
I tried to reason with her, and told her in a polite tone that the dog was not even for a second out of her bag, she stuck her head out as it is an animal who reacts like an animal. I insisted that we are polite people and respect rules and we will make sure the dog will stay in the bag, she just needed a little water. 
The dog was in the bag at our feet for the entire flight, and she was exemplary. Not a sound, not the slightest attempt to come out like she sensed your employee's hostile attitude. During the flight, another flight attendant came to our seat and asked how the dog was, nice and courteous, asked us if we needed any water for her. The woman next to us approached us and asked what kind of dog she was and pointed out how rude your employee was. In the morning, same nice flight attendant came to our seat to serve breakfast and asked about the dog, telling us she was the most well behaved dog they had on board. Nice, polite and professional. Nora Meringer passed by our seats giving us the same hostile look, didn't ask a question about how the dog had been over the night, and to top the rude attitude, while we were waiting to get off the plane she told my husband in a sarcastic tone: I guess your dog didn't suffocate in her bag.
We flew Swiss before and we were always pleased with the level of politeness and courtesy, this employee casts a bad image on your business.

Ruthless and uninformed chief flight attendant,Zurich,Muscat Governorate,International,"On August 16th 2019, I was abruptly talked down in front of my family by the chief flight attendant who did not allow me to enter the plane with my YoYo stroller. His argument was that i did not have a bag! I kindly told him that it was the first time in 8 years that I was not allowed in with my YOYO stroller and I requested him to show me the specific regulation on strollers. At this point, he got very annoyed as I was dubious about his action. It took him 20 minutes to find the regulation. His colleagues seemed also surprised as all airlines around the world Allow passengers carrying a YOYO stroller to bring it in any plane even on the smallest without a bag (i had just flown from Bordeaux to Zurich with Swissair in a smaller place where I was allowed to take my YoYo stroller!) 
 When folded the YoYo does not look like a stroller!!!
 After 20 minutes, he finally came with the regulation which was clearly saying that any strollers looking like a stroller when folded needed to be in a bag. Though i explained him that a YoYo was not looking like a stroller, he threatened me not to let me in the plane if I would not comply!
I ended up going to my seat  to realize later on when we landed that the passenger in front of me had his YoYo stroller without a bag which meant that some of other flight attendants judged that it was ok!!!! I immediately asked the chief flight attendant who gave his hand and said enough of this!!!! The rudeness and the condescendence shocked me!

Uncomfortable,Zurich,Tokyo,International,"My journey from Zurich to Tokyo was a 12 hour flight, but damn did it feel longer.
I'm someone who flies relatively often and I have never felt more like a tinned sardine. It's bad enough when the person in front has there seat all the way back on you, but when the seating is physically so close to your own seating you can't comfortably put your feet on the floor, there's a real problem.

I caught a pretty nasty cold about an hour in due to raging air-con (out of my control) which also gave me a headache. I also got sick, but as I'd not eaten anything from feeling ill I was left to throw up mucus in the public loo. 

At this point I knew I couldn't squeeze back into my 'nice' 'cozy' spot between two people so I sought out the flight staff who initially did not want to help me at all. Luckily one guy was nice and gave me water and a doggy bag (finally). Just so you know I've flown 18+ times and I've never felt ill, but this was my fist long haul aside from 8 hours if you'd call it that.

I left the plane sick with two different things and severely dehydrated, and quite frankly wishing I hadn't gone to Tokyo lol cause I was sick for the whole time.

I don't know what model of plane I boarded but it's not suitable for long haul that's for sure.
I wouldn't have written this review if my flight back wasn't so so so much nicer. There was leg room, arm space, the meal was lovely, there was even a TV screen each, and best of all you could actually breathe!!!

So if you're going to Tokyo, fly with Ana. If you're going long haul, don't fly with Swiss Air.",February 2019,"August 30, 2019",2.0,,,,,,,,

Terrible service with pregnant wife and small boy,Cagliari,Copenhagen,Europe,"When flying home on 30th of august from Cagliari to Copenhagen with Edelweiss and Swiss Air (tickets bought via Swiss Air) me, my pregnant wife and our 2,5 year old soon were denied online check in.

So we had to cancel a dinner reservation in Cagliari and arrange taxi for 0430 in the morning instead. When arriving at 0450 in the airport we were told that the check in would open at about 0700 at the earliest. So unfortunately Swiss Air managed to ruin the last 2 days of our summer holiday.

How to get rid of your frequent flyers,D√ºsseldorf,Zurich,Europe,"I just learned how much the Lufthansa Group cares for its customers. I usually do about 50+ flights per year since several years with them. I took a Swiss flight in the morning from Zurich to D√ºsseldorf and was supposed to fly back with Eurowings to Zurich. Now the flight keeps delaying for hours without reason. 
So I thought I could get some help from the miles-and-more service as I'm quite a frequent customer and I learnt interesting things:
1. I have a Eurowings ticket on the way back which means I got two independent tickets.
2. The miles-and-more service can open tickets which are booked with miles or Lufthansa and Swiss tickets but not Eurowings tickets. (Interestingly even if you book Lufthansa you always get a Eurowings flight with significantly less service within Europe9
3. If I want any help I have to call Eurowings which does not help much as I spend a long time in the waiting queue.

So for me as a customer I really don't care in how many airlines Lufthansa Group wants to split itself up and for what reason but I care that if I book a ticket with any of them I get a proper service and I get the same one.
Maybe this is on intention to help people choosing other airline which may value the service more.",August 2019,"August 27, 2019",1.0,,,,,,,,

SWISS's descent from first-rate Swissair to a second-rate nickel-and-diming operation,Chicago,Zurich,International,"I've lived in Switzerland for 35 years and have flown SWISS (and before it SwissAir) at least 50 times, so I am in a good position to give an accurate review.   SwissAir was a premium airline until its famous demise in 2001.  There is little to report before then, my 15-20 flights with it were generally on time, affordable in off-peak times but expensive at peak.  There was one 8-hr delay for a Zurich-Boston flight, with multiple apologies and a generous voucher, and some delays of less than 1 hr, all forgivable given the many flights I had taken.  SwissAir went bankrupt post 9/11, due to drastically reduced ridership at a critical time for its finances.  Officially it ceased to exist in order to avoid commitments to creditors, but its subsidiary CrossAir took over the international business, becoming the current SWISS in the process.  Thus one can objectively say that SWISS is the continuation of SwissAir, and, indeed, the former tries to live off of the legacy of quality of the latter.

SWISS was 'rationalized' with reduced international service, cutbacks in flight service, and cuts in pay for personnel (all documented in the media).  There were great prices off-peak, but coupled with large additional fees (like most other budget airlines. Still I had fair experiences from 2001 - 2014 (again 15-20 flights), with another 8-hr delay on Zurich-Boston (with a smaller voucher and no apologies), several delays of more than 1 hr, and jam-packed flights thanks to aggressive pricing strategies.  Good for SWISS: they seemed to have returned to the black.

But the fact is from 2015, SWISS has gone into a downward quality spiral, which can only be associated with a low-cost carrier, even if their prices are not low cost.   I live near Lugano, from which Swiss offers Zurich- and Geneva-bound flights, where connections can be made.  From 2015 onward these have been canceled regularly.  Since 2015 on about 10 flights I've had 6 major delays due to either missed connections in Zurich, or canceled flights to/from Lugano, along with minor delays (up to 1hr). Here is an overview:

	o A late arrival (>2hrs) in Zurich which caused a missed connection flight to Lugano, resulting in a night in Zurich.  Overall delay: about 12 hrs.
	o An on-time arrival in Zurich, but a canceled Lugano segment.  Swiss put me on a train to Zurich resulting in more than a 2-hr arrival delay.
	o A canceled flight from Hamburg-Zurich, due to inclement weather.  Frequent fliers in my party managed to rebook on an earlier flight, but Swiss claimed the flight was full when they passed the phone to me.  Due to an additional flight cancellations, this led to a 12-hour train journey from Hamburg to Lugano.  Total delay about 11 hrs.
	o A flight from Lugano to Zurich was canceled only 15 minutes before its alleged 'on-time' departure.  Swiss put us in a train to Zurich, with an overnight in Zurich, where the first flight on the next leg in the morning was canceled and the second was more than 1hr late.  Total delay: about 15 hrs.
	o Outbound flight from Zurich delayed more than 1 hr., and then on return trip, more than 1hr delay in the Zurich-Lugano segment.  But in this case, no missed connections.

Even if you believe I just have bad luck, our company has experienced so many delays and cancellations on the Zurich-Lugano segment that it is now our official policy to fly us out of Milan instead of Lugano.  Why all these cancellations?  Lugano can indeed have serious thunderstorms, but the flight cancellations occur frequently, also in good weather.  The better explanation is that this segment is not well patronized and loses money.  If a flight has too few passengers it is canceled, and any 'collateral damage' is dealt with.  Swiss outsourced the route to Adria a couple of years ago so the cancellations do not stain its reputation, but Adria's flights are cross-listed as a SWISS, and SWISS advertises and sells through-connections from Lugano on their website.  

Already the Lugano connection is indicative of the ice-cold 'rationalization' of Swiss in recent years, and my company's boycott is an appropriate response.  But on my last flight I experienced nickel-and-diming on a scale that I thought was reserved for cheapo airlines like Ryanair.  I booked tickets months in advance to the USA for my family. The price was not competitive, but at least SWISS offered direct flight from Zurich to Los Angeles.  In the booking I had used my wife's married name in her Swiss passport.  Unfortunately she asked for the ESTA visa waiver with her other passport, which is in her maiden name.  Not a problem, I thought: during on-line check-in I typed in her maiden name and proper passport number.  At the airport there was consternation because the check-in name did not match the booking name. SWISS staff tried to make a name change on the ticket, for which we paid CHF 25 (OK, fair enough, my wife and I got our signals crossed), but then said were not able to complete it. They told us to ask the transfer agent in Zurich for the boarding pass of the LAX segment.  We approached the agent in Zurich, worried that my wife might not be able to fly.  To our great surprise, he immediately printed out the boarding pass with her correct maiden name, and we were on our way.  What a great vacation!  Happy end, right?  

On the morning of our return I checked my email: automatic check-in from SWISS for 3 passengers: my sons and me, but no mention of my wife (with either name).  I logged in to my account: the booking had been changed to only us three -- my wife had been removed, probably part of SWISS's amateurish attempt to change the name.  No real concern, certainly a clerical error. During a call to the SWISS toll-free number, 'Noa' was overwhelmed by the problem, saying that there were only 3 in the booking and no indication that my wife had even flown to the USA (to which I replied ""she is standing next to me; would you like to talk to her?""), and I would have to buy a new ticket from my wife.  I told her we would do that under no circumstances, and she promised to call back.  She did not.  Another call to the 800 number: 'Melissa' said that there was a booking in my wife's maiden name, but it had not been ticketed.  She said 'Noa' would call us back in 20 minutes, which she did not.  It was slowly time to head to the airport, and we were getting nervous.  Another call reached 'Andi'.  After many times on hold, she finally returned to say that 'Noa' had clarified with their ticketing department: we would have to buy a new ticket and apply for a 'partial refund'.  The nickel-and-diming was in full swing.   I explained that we would not pay under any circumstances: SWISS had accidentally deleted the return booking, and furthermore, since my wife is not a US citizen, SWISS was *legally obligated* to fulfill the requirement of transporting her back to Switzerland (fact checkers: see the ESTA rules).  She said that was their final decision, and I asked to speak to her supervisor.  ""He will only tell you the same thing"", 'Andi' offered.  But I insisted.  Another 20-minute on hold -- my wife was already on the other line phoning the ESTA help number -- not the supervisor, but 'Andi' was back.  She had what she felt was a great offer: SWISS would reissue the ticket, waive the price difference, I would only have to pay the service fees of CHF 45.  Given that SWISS had -- absolutely without any sensible reason -- canceled my wife's return trip, I was tempted to turn her down and let the US Immigration and Naturalization Service talk to them.  But realistically it is always bad news when US officials are are involved.  So I paid their ransom and am doing now what I promised 'Andi', namely giving SWISS the review it deserves. And my compliant letter will be in the mail soon. So much for the paying the extra money for a SWISS flight: you get nickel-and-dimed all the same!

For good measure, the flight international segment had an aborted start (due to a 'faulty warning light' according to the pilot), but we made the connection to Lugano, not canceled this time but which had a 45 minute arrival delay. 

SWISS is the empty shell of SwissAir.  It touts its awards for its First Class Lounge in New York, but that will not help you get where you are going on time.  It serves its Swiss satellite city of Lugano poorly (perhaps also Geneva, but I have no experience).  If you are an economy traveler, don't expect to be treated as anything more than an opportunity to squeeze out a few more Swiss Francs.",August 2019,"August 25, 2019",2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,4.0

European flights,Malaga,Zurich,Europe,"Owned by Lufthansa, and part of the Star Alliance group, makes it a reliable airline. There are normally solutions at times there are problems. 
Swiss pilots are probably among the best. In the cabin, probably some works need to be done regarding efficiency, not at least speeding up the boarding procedure. Personnel is of course very friendly.
The food is good, slightly more innovative than other airlines, and a piece of Swiss chocolate is never wrong.
It seems, they currently have difficulties with their slots. Probably this is just a summer issue but happened on both flights this same day. Thanks to the A 321, they recovered most of the delay by flying pretty fast.
Best not to pack any heavy-Duty free goods, as bottles, prior to boarding, as you may have to open your hand luggage trolley at gate, just to prove to be right in that you don‚Äôt carry more than eight kilos.
Back packs are best removed before entering the aircraft, as anyone carrying a backpack often forgets they wear one, and when turning around, it is not unusual that they hit another fellow passenger with their added back part. This, not by purpose, but normally without even noticing. Furthermore, ideally back packs are placed under the seat in front, except for at emergency doors.

Used to be good...,D√ºsseldorf,Dubai,International,"Day flight from Duesseldorf via Z√ºrich to Dubai.
Flight from DUS to Zurich ok. Typical eco class seats, but with middle seat free. Gate personnel just ok.
Airport Zurich was packed, but all went fine. Lounge in E gates (Senator) good.
Plane was late because they could not consolidate the gate count with their own count ...for 45 min, after that, they suddenly solved the issue.
Seat was very hard - I mentioned it, no reaction at all.
With the hours going by this became more and more uncomfortable, so finally got a flight attendant to look at it ... -the back has about 3 mm upholstery - he didn‚Äôt show any real interest.
Another hour goes by, ask for Purser, who proceeds to play around with some buttons and then tells me that the air pump in the seat is not working ....and I should have told them earlier !?!
End result is that I had the ‚Äúpleasure‚Äù of spending a lot for a seat which was nothing but steel springs with come cloth over top.

First experience of Swiss business class long haul,Zurich,Singapore,International,"This week I had the pleasure of trying Swiss Air‚Äôs business class from Zurich to Singapore. The boarding and welcome experience was as expected, warm yet efficient. 
The cabin and seat was comfortable but seated in a twin seat configuration one side is snuggly surrounded by storage yet the other is very open to the aisle. The single seats are definitely the best. All seats recline (like Emirates) without the need to get up and haul the seat over (like Lufthansa or AirNZ). 
Unlike Emirates no mattress topper is available. Instead the seat has an inflatable feature. I found this less than satisfactory as the joint between the seat and seat back was still obvious and sadly not 100% comfortable. 
The food and drinks were very good and the service was great. I loved the mini Swiss chocolate bars they were so good!

I heard from courier service upon arriving home that in fact bag was returned to the very airport where I was told it was lost.  After 5 emails, and numerous phone calls, still NO ONE from Swiss Air has contacted me or gotten back to me.  They continue to say nothing or respond even to emails.  My flight was now 17 days ago.  I was traveling for my sons wedding.  I had nothing but the clothes I had on and a few items in my carry on.  I am also seeing on their website they will only reimburse $100; which barely covers the cost of the lost luggage let alone the dress I had to purchase to attend the wedding.

Lost Baggage,Nice,Mumbai,International,"I recently traveled to Mumbai from Nice, via Zurich on flight (LX 0565) & LX0154) respectively, which arrived on 30th at Mumbai. I had 4 checked in luggages.
 One of these baggages,  which was supposed to be checked all the way through to my final destination has apparently been completely mishandled and 
 not loaded with my other baggages.
The ground staff at the Mumbai lost baggage counter informed me that they had received information that this baggage would be arriving only the next day. 
Since i traveled to Trivandrum on the 31st of July, the baggage was later delivered to the Trivandrum airport from where I picked it up on 1st August evening. 
When i  collected my parcel from the Trivandrum airport , it was a sorry state of affairs and I was appalled by the callousness with which the bag had been handled. 
In fact, the authorities at Bombay airport also confirmed that they received this bag in an open state and hence had to wrap it in plastic before they sent it to Trivandrum airport.

There were lot of missing items and my baggage completely damaged and made unusable. and a Total estimated loss of more than 300 euros

Of course, the real loss is not just limited to the monetary aspect, taking into account the inconvenience caused, stress and the time spent purchasing and selecting these products.

Unresonable policy and rude staff - NEVER AGAIN,Canton of Geneva,London,Europe,"Unreasonable and rude describes best my experience with Swiss air. 
I booked a return flight from london to Geneva to attend my sister's graduation. 
Last minute, i had to fly to Barcelona for work so flew directly to Geneva from there, missing my outgoing flight. 

My surprise was when arriving at Geneva airport for my return flight to london, where I am told i have no booking as it my reservation was cancelled. If you don't board the outgoing flight, they assume you never made it to Switzerland and cancel the full booking. No notice. No email. And no refund.  
The customer service lady at the airport is annoyed that she has to explain this to me. She says is tired of repeating the same to customers over and over after 10 years, and 'everyone coming with the same complaint when it is clearly explained when you book the ticket'. Well, clearly not so obviously if you have to explain this over and over for years.

Unfriendly and unwilling to help, had to book another seat, on the same flight for 300‚Ç¨ , plus an extra 60‚Ç¨ for booking at the airport (of course, wouldn't even consider waiving that).

Ended up booking two seats on the same flight, and yelled at by a unhappy woman that ALWAYS reads the 55 pages on the terms and conditions.

Of course, when I complain theres nothing offered, neither apologies, refund for my cancelled booking without notice, nothing. Surprise. 

My advice:

Flight Cancelled - Sad and frustrated!,London,Zurich,Europe,"I had a terrible experience in my first time flying with Swiss Airlines 
I booked a more expensive flight with them in order to fly from the most central airport in London (city airport) on a Friday night to see my family for the weekend ( they are from Brazil and were going to be in Zurich for a few days).
The flight was cancelled and I was rebooked to a new flight in the next day (Saturday) from a more distant airport (Heathrow) with a connection flight, which means I‚Äôll only get to my final destination today at 3:30pm.

SWISS Air experience‚Ä¶huge disappointment!,Moscow,Barcelona,Europe,"I recently booked a flight for 2 people with SWISS Air and below is a summary of my experience and interactions with SWISS Air when I had to cancel the booking:

1.	A few days after my booking I saw duplicate charges posted to my account (1 charge for each ticket) with ticket #s in the description, as well as Austrian Airlines (not SWISS Air!) stated in the description.

2.	Contacted SWISS Air by phone, who had no idea what I was talking about and asked me to put it all in writing.

3.	At the same time had to contact my credit card provider and lodge a formal dispute and investigation regarding the validity of transactions.

4.	A week later SWISS Air emailed back with proof that they only charged my account once i.e. duplicate transactions were not from them.

5.	Contacted my credit card provider to cancel my credit card.

6.	A few weeks later SWISS Air emailed back saying it was them who charged my credit card and they will organize a refund.

7.	Another week later got the refund, however, due to currency conversion, when the refund hit my account I was out pocket by $20+.
 
8.	Contacted SWISS Air regarding the payment shortfall, who said that it had nothing to do with them and it‚Äôs my Bank who translated the amount at the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù rate‚Ä¶

To sum up, even though SWISS Air charged my credit card without my authority (i.e. it was a duplicate payment), provided misleading information in the transactions' description, took more than a month to confirm that there will be a refund and only because I made a formal complaint to my Bank and also notified SWISS Air...somehow because of all of this I got penalised and have to be out of pocket! 

Somehow, SWISS Air thinks it is fair that I have to now pay for something that was not my fault to start with and are turning a blind eye to the fact that had these duplicate transactions never took place, Rate of Exchange used by my Bank would be irrelevant and not applicable, as there would have been no disputed transactions/transactions waiting to be refunded and, hence, converted from one currency to another‚Ä¶I am not even talking about the time spent and the inconvenience caused by me having to cancel the credit card that was not financially compromised to start with!

Airline experience great booking website awful,Manchester,Zurich,Europe,"The flight was excellent, the cabin crew very friendly I would give 5 out of 5 if it wasn't for the awful booking website and the truly diabolical telephone help line. We booked flights in 2 steps for 2 passengers each. Try to do anything out the ordinary and its a nightmare. On our first attempt it included speaking on the phone to 3 different ""customer service"" operatives who gave totally conflicting advice this ended in my son booking his flights in total 3 times after doing what he was advised by customer services only to be told by another operative each time it was wrong and have to cancel it and start again. This meant he finally had no funds left in his account as it takes upto 14 days to refund the transaction. All he wanted to do was book a cycle onto the flight but this seems to be a major obstacle for Swiss Air systems. Why not make life easier and allow booking of an oversized item online rather than have to book your seats online then phone up to add the cycle in its bike box!

Swiss efficiency...,Shanghai,Milan,International,"Dear Swiss,
I just want to share my last experience with your airline.
Flying business class from Shanghai to Milan via Zurich on July 27.
On-board of the Shanghai-Zurich Flight the entertainment system did not work for some 3 hours.
Many apologies, but ‚Ä¶ poor maintenance.
Arrived in Zurich (15:50) I discovered that my connecting flight to Milan (17:20) had been cancelled for ‚Äúbad weather conditions‚Äù. In Milan the weather was fine, in Zurich we had some little rain for about 10 minutes.
I wonder how the famous Swiss efficiency deals with snow when it happens‚Ä¶
Anyway I went to the Transfer Desk A  where, at the business class counter, I was told that there were no more flights to Milan so I should have stayed overnight.
I was lucky as, at the counter close to mine, the economy class one, there was a couple of Italians with the same problem, and they were proposed a flight leaving for Milan at 20:55.
So I asked the lady at my counter to check again; she looked upset, after all an Italian was criticizing a Swiss citizen, I had to ask one more time, but she finally did it and, oh miracle, she found the flight. A mystery why the flight did not show up at the first search; Indeed, the lady at the counter was another champion of the famous Swiss efficiency. ..
So I was re-booked on a same day flight.
I went to the lounge for my  more-than-4-hours waiting, and then, around 20:30, I went to the gate A84 to finally fly back home.
Many wannabe passengers were queuing there, but we all were told that our flight was delayed and our plane was still in Frankfurt, so we would have probably to wait another one or two hours.
I walked back to the lounge and, having completely lost any trust in the way Swiss organises things, I asked the lady at the entrance to check again at what time the flight to Milan had been postponed.
She said ‚Äú21:35‚Äù, and when I told her that the plane was still in Frankfurt ten minutes before, she said that no, the plane was already at the gate.
10 minutes to get from Frankfurt to Zurich‚Ä¶ WOW! Swiss is shortening the average flight time and setting a new world record: 10 minutes for a flight than normally takes one hour‚Ä¶
That‚Äôs efficiency!
So I walked back to the gate to board and asked the lady at the gate to be changed to an aisle seat as, while walking back to the gate, I had noticed that I had been rebooked on a windows set, which I do not like. ‚ÄúNo Sir, there are no free seats anymore, you have to stay where you are‚Äù
Fine;  after a 12 hours flight from Shanghai plus more than five hours waiting,  you can even accept a place in the toilet, I am sure that Swiss knows.
Once on board, I sat down on my seat and discovered that all business class passengers had been booked without any neighbour, so the seat at my side was free, and was of course an aisle seat. 
Swiss efficiency.. 
Landing in Milan at 22:32, so with more than 4 hours delay (my original flight was due to land at 18:15) we all went to the luggage delivery, and of course, after waiting the last baggage , I finally accepted the fact that Swiss had lost my suitcase.
Having had only five hours in Zurich to unload my luggage from the Shanghai flight to transfer it to my Milan one is indeed a short time‚Ä¶ 
Swiss efficiency..
Another long walk at the Lost & Found counter where I found some 40 people queuing but I saw the counter for Star Alliance Business Class passengers: 
No queue there!!! 
But nobody at the desk‚Ä¶
Yes, this is not handled by Swiss, but a good airline also chooses good partners, and indeed the level of your handling partner in Milan is the same as yours.
Back to the only one queue (one single lady at the desk for some 40 passengers, then augmenting to 50) around half past midnight I managed to finalize the Property Irregularity Report.
Yes, queuing for 2 hours, standing‚Ä¶
Swiss efficiency.. 
Of course after midnight there are no more trains to Milan, so I took the bus, leaving at 1:30 am and by 2:30 I was back home, without my luggage but with a growing sentiment of real admiration for Swiss.
The following day I wrote you through your website and immediately got a reply, WOW!
It was an automatic mail quoting the file number assigned to my claim. After this‚Ä¶ nothing, of course.
Swiss efficiency‚Ä¶
The end? No, of course. 
You have a tracking system for the lost baggage which works very well.  I used it, until the moment in which I was informed that my suitcase had been given to a company for the delivery to my house.
To which company? When will be the delivery? Total mystery, Swiss efficiency‚Ä¶ 
And of course the tracking system says that the matter is closed‚Ä¶ 
Oh, but yes, there is also a phone number‚Ä¶  Yes, it is a phone of your handling partner, not of Swiss, but as I said its level of efficiency is the same as yours, so no way to speak with any human being...
The following day (July 29), I received  a phone call in the late morning saying that the delivery was scheduled between 16:00 and 18:00.
So I stopped working earlier in order to be at home in time and‚Ä¶. waited. Waited. Waited. Waited.
At 20:00, while I was having  dinner,  I received a phone call asking me if I was at home around 20:30 for the delivery. 
Swiss efficiency‚Ä¶
Yes I was at home, so when the intercom rang I explained the delivery guy how to get to my door, but he said that no, I myself had to pick my luggage at the street level. 
Swiss efficiency‚Ä¶
What else? 
Nothing, as Swiss seems to ignore also the second claim I made online.
But meanwhile, as a final proof of Swiss efficiency, I got a mail (July 30) from Swiss Customer Feedback asking me to fill in a survey about my recent flight..
Are you joking? Swissair already went bankrupt years ago, but Swiss is not doing any better I am afraid‚Ä¶

Average in every way,Zurich,Belgrade,Europe,"Check in was quick and easy, and getting to the lounge in D was simple. The lounge in D though is small and lacks any wow factor. The food offered was below par: a choice of overcooked pasta or overcooked spatzle with vegetables. There were 2 soups: the cold tomato soup was good but the hot soup was like salty water. There were a lot of breads but nothing to put on them / with them (no meats / cheeses / butter). They had a lot of Movenpick ice cream but every one was coffee flavour. I asked if they had any other flavours or butter and was told 'no'. The staff working the buffet were either not happy to be there or were having a bad day. They offer free wifi when you go in but it's just the airport wifi. Very hot as the AC wasn't working properly and they had to rely on fans. 
Our flight kept getting delayed and we did get an email about this. When I asked the staff member at the gate she did not know anything about it. When we eventually boarded it was again a disappointment - same as economy but with a spare seat. No welcome drink, no inflight entertainment.

A few people were about to miss a connection flight because of bad weather in Italy. The ground staff dealt a lot better than most of their peers in keeping people informed about how things are going and attempting to help them get their connections.

An incredible airline for value and service.,Canton of Geneva,Munich,Europe,"We flew on this airline when going from Geneva to Munich, and I can‚Äôt recommend it enough! 

Despite being a short flight (only 1 hour from memory), the seats were extremely comfortable. Despite not having any in-flight screens (which was understandable for such a short flight), the views from outside over the Swiss mountains were extraordinary. 

The in-flight food was amazing. They had a freshly baked roll with genuine Swiss cheese on it, with a bottle of water and Swiss chocolate. For an hour flight, I would go as far as to say it was some of the best airplane food I‚Äôve ever eaten. 

The only thing was that our baggage got mixed up at the terminal at Munich airport, but that was most likely just be fault of the airport, not the airline.

Overall, would 100% recommend to travellers for short flights. I don‚Äôt know about long-haul flights or if they use another type of aircraft with screens.",June 2019,"July 27, 2019",5.0,,,,,,,,
Their 777 Economy smallest sized space for humans ever,Zurich,San Francisco,International,"It is amazing how greed can create humans that will order a design of a plane that is so cramped and small for humans that if you are not 5'5"" and 140LBS or less you do not fit properly or comfortably in the spaces.  An average person can not walk down the aisle without having to move in a sideward fashion as they are so thin.  A flight that lasts over 11 hours is torture and unhealthy to passengers no matter what great entertainment you have.

Swiss Breaks the Law and Not Pay According to Regulation EC261/2004,Bangkok,Zurich,International,"We had a flight in business class BKK-ZRH then a few days before the flight I went online to check our seat assignment only to realize the flight had been cancelled because of a defective aircraft (leading to cancellations for several days straight) and NOBODY from Swiss even informed us, nor did they even bother to rebook us automatically to another flight.  By then other passengers had been rebooked on the most convenient flights and were full; we were out of luck.  We were eventually rebooked on Thai Aiways flight instead, at a very inconvenient time to us.  

Swiss must pay compensation of 600 EUR per person (=1200 EUR) as per regulation EC261/2004 because we got rebooked on a flight with arrival time /¬†date nowhere near what we were originally booked.  I submitted the claim, Swiss acknowledged they owe 1200 EUR and asked for my bank account information:
‚ÄúYour flight LX181 on 16 June 2019 unfortunately had to be cancelled at short notice. On behalf of SWISS and our cooperation partners, I apologize for the inconvenience you had as a result. I have checked the reason of the cancellation of your flight and can inform you that SWISS will grant you a compensation to the amount of EUR 600.00 each. On receiving your IBAN, the total amount of CHF 1 332.00 (EUR 1 200.00) will be transferred to your account within 14 days.‚Äù

I provided my bank account info on June 27, then on July 18 I still did not have payment so I sent another e-mail to the same Swiss e-mail address that we had exchanges in June about the payment.  I was stonewalled, I e-mailed again on July 23, 25, 26, all e-mails are being unanswered.  Swiss‚Äô strategy seems to ignore, therefore I must bring this case public.  They had their chance to do the right thing privately but failed.  

Shame on you Swiss, not only the cancelled flight notification was handled poorly (in fact, you did not handle it at all), but now you refuse to pay as per regulations and ignore customers.  I invite you to comment in here about your behavior.  It‚Äôs the law, you must pay, there is no debate to have.

In the future I will do my best to avoid an airline who cannot do the most basic things such as following the law.  Other readers on TripAdvisor should be aware.",June 2019,"July 26, 2019",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0

"No connection flight when arriving in Zurich, Switzerland to fly to Kiev, Ukraine",New York City,Kyiv,International,"My husband and son traveled to Kyiv, Ukraine from JFK Airport in New York City on May 2, 2019. I expected this trip to be very smooth as they were traveling Swiss Airlines, a good airline according to previous experience. Unfortunately, they were for a very unpleasant surprise, when they got to Zurich there was no connection for the flight to Kyiv. Fortunately, a family member was able to put them in a LOT (Polish airline) flight, from Zurich to Warsaw and then Warsaw to Kyiv.

flight was OK but the check-in and boarding procedure was sub-standard,Zurich,Newark,International,"- my wife couldn't check in online, because (a) this was a code share with United and we couldn't find out the Swiss confirmation code; (b) using the ticket number didn't work. I finally called their help desk and was told that I was writing her first name as ""Jane"" and it had to be ""JaneEllen"" with Ellen her middle name and no spaces. (!) They really can't figure out who it is even if you give them the ticket number plus last name? Or at least give feedback as to what they're looking for?

- my online check in didn't work either---I just got a message after completing the process saying ""This is not a boarding pass. Please show this document at the check-in counter upon your arrival at the airport. It will be exchanged with a valid boarding pass."" Some feedback would again be nice; I never figured out what went wrong. 

- at the airport there's an extra passport check at the gate due to TSA requirements. Most airlines handle this smoothly, but Swiss waited until 45 minutes before boarding time, then kicked everyone out of the gate area and made them line up, then spent 20 minutes slowly setting up little desks and gathering staff while 200 passengers, many elderly, stood in line, then checked all the passports again. Total waiting time in line about 30-40 minutes. Certainly this is the cheapest way to do the job, but treating the passengers like cattle is not good.

- at boarding all the economy passengers stood in a line on the left while the first class boarded from a line on the right. Then the staff member announced that economy passengers should board from the right. So 150 people moved over to the right, at which point another staff member yelled at them that this line was for first class and everyone should go to the left. Once again, treated like cattle for no good reason.

- and on the plane the entertainment system was broken, as was my seat back.

Having said this, the flight attendants were gracious and the flight left and arrived more-or-less on time. Swiss needs to pay a lot more attention to the pre-flight processing, both electronic and on-site.

Great Entertainment,Chicago,Zurich,International,"For this being my first international flight, I was very impressed with how easy the overall flight was.

Many say who cares about the games; however, who wouldn't want to play Tetris in the sky? It was nice because you could also play Battleship against someone else on the plane, so my sister and I took advantage of that. The best part of the trip was the little swiss chocolate they give you toward the end of the flight!

Awful Customer Service!!,Budapest,Newark,International,"We arrived at the airport in Budapest at 11:30 local time and had passed through security and were sitting at the departure gate by 11:55 local time.  We received notice from Swiss Airlines at 13:13 local time that our 14:15 local time departure had been moved to 15:10 hours.  At 13:48 we received a 2nd notice that our flight would not be departing until 15:50 hours.  (Please see emails below)
We went directly to the gate to ask the Swiss gate representative if we would still make our connecting flight to Newark.  He indicated that we woud not, but that he would book us on the same flight to Newark on July 6 leaving Zurich at 17:20 hours local time.  We asked if we would have the same or better seats on the flight leaving the 6th and he assured us that we would be very happy.  The Swiss Airlines gate attendant also assured us that once we got to Zurich, we should check in with Swiss Air personnel and they would arrange for meals and hotel accomodations.  At the end of this conversation he thanked us for being so easy to work with, and again assured us we would be very comfortable in Zurich.  Little did we know how dishonest he was and how little Swiss Airlines cares about their passangers!
When we arrived in Zurich our first stop was at the first Swiss Airlines desk we could find.  There we were told that Swiss Airlines would not be handling our rebooking documents or our overnight accomodations.  We were pointed down the hall to transfer services.  This Swiss Airlines Gate attendant did give us our first copy of our passangers bill of rights, little did we know what was POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE we were in for!
At the transfer services we found out that we had been booked by the Swiss Airlines gate attendant in Budapest to JFK airport in New York and not to Newark airport in New Jersey.  Our car was parked in Newark NJ at the airport.  Guest Service indicated that Swiss Airlines would not pay for a cab from JFK to Newark to pick up our car.  We indicated that this was not accaptable and requested we be rebooked on a flight to Newark NJ.  We spent almost THREE HOURS at transfer services, we were booked on flights that would get us to Newark NJ.  The lady at transfer services also gave us a copy of the passengers bill of rights.
The Nightmare begins‚Ä¶  Our bags were checked through to JFK so we, NOT SWISS AIRLINES STAFF had to go to baggage claim to recover our checked bags.  This took almost an hour, we were then told we needed to recheck our bags that evening since our flight to Brussels was so early.  We were told there would not be time in the morning unless we arrived at 04:00 to check our bags.  Once we retrieved our bags I asked a baggage check employee where to go to re-check the baggage, he yelled at me that it was not his job to provide directions, handed me another copy of the passengers bill of rights, and told me to find a Swiss Airlines staff member and walked away.
After we found a non Swiss Airlines person willing to give us directions we found our way to the Swiss Airlines departure area.  While checking our bags, I asked the Swiss Airlines attendant how we go about getting reimbursed for the fees we paid to pre-select our seats and for the premium coach seating we paid for, for the flight that left without us.  She indicated she had no idea and handed us yet another copy of the passengers bill of rights!  We then asked this Swiss Airlines attendant how to get to the tram to get to the hotel, she again stated she could not help us!!  We wandered around and found ourselves on the level for train service.  Lucky for us we found a gentlemen who indicated to us we were at the wrong type of train service.  We needed to be on a tram and should travel back up to the main concourse and ask for help.  We did this, found another Swiss Airlines employee who pointed in a general direction and handed us ANOTHER passengers bill of rights!!  While wandering around we found a gentlemen who walked us up two levels and out of the building and took us to the Tram station.  He stayed with us until the correct tram arrived, he WAS NOT employed by the airport, he was just a very kind person.
The next round of POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE begins!  We were given a voucher by the transfer services staff for a hotel and meal coupons for dinner and breakfast.  We were told once we had recovered and re-checked our bags we could go to the hotel for a meal and some needed sleep.  Once on the tram we found our way to the second stop only to realize we had a bit of a hike ahead of us.  I have a military disability, and her foot had been stepped on at the airport. The guest service staff never asked us if walking or climbing could be an issue for us!
We were greeted at the hotels front desk and given a terrific room, once we deposited our carry on luggage in the hotel room we headed down to the restaurant for a much needed and VERY LATE DINNER, it was almost 21:00 hours!  
In the restaurant we were told the hotel had a private group in the hotel that night and the only meal they could offer us was pasta or risotto!  Neither of us eat either food items offered, we asked to speak to the restaurant manager, who told us due to the size of the group they were feeding, these were the only two options available to us!  I then left the restaurant looking for the hotel manager, the front desk told me there was no manager on duty.
When I explained to the gentlemen at the front desk what was going on, he explained to me that the food coupon was only good for $20 in Francs each and NO drinks of any kind.  He also explained there were no meals on the menu under $20 Francs for that matter.  After much arguing we were given two side salads and water for dinner.
After our ‚Äúwonderful‚Äù dinner experience we asked about breakfast.  We were told that the restaurant did not open until 06:00.  We were offered a ‚Äúboxed‚Äù breakfast.  When we checked out at 05:30 on the 6th our ‚Äúboxed‚Äù breakfast was waiting for us.  Not only did we have to carry our luggage back to the airport we had to carry breakfast which did not include coffee because it was to early for the kitchen.  We traveled to the airport intending to eat our ‚Äúboxed‚Äù breakfast once we cleared security.  Only to find out security would not allow us to take it through.  So much for breakfast!
We feel that Swiss Airlines should compensate us for this TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE experience.  The passenger bill of rights states, ‚Äúpassengers are entitled to receive care while waiting. This includes meals and refreshments in a reasonable relation to the waiting time‚Äù‚Ä¶. We did not choose the hotel or the restaurant, Swiss Airlines chose these for us.  We should have been fed two meals each, we were not asking for lobster or filet mignon, we were asking for a meal.  Even on the flight we were offered a choice of three meals.
The passenger bill of rights goes on to state, ‚Äú You are entitled to receive compensation if you arrive at your final destination with a delay of more than 3 hours provided the delay is not attributable to extraordinary circumstances..‚Äù  When we boarded the flight from Budapest to Zurich the pilot indicated that they were late due to crowded runways, not due to ‚Äúextraordinary circumstances‚Äù.
We did not ‚Äúreceive care‚Äù as stated in the passenger bill of rights, from the Swiss Airlines staff as indicated, all we received were many copies of the passenger bill of rights.  We kept EIGHT Copies of the passenger bill of rights that were offered.  What we experienced goes beyond poor customer service, we would like to suggest that Swiss Airlines train their staff to help the customer rather than hand out the passengers bill of rights.
Swiss Air responded to this letter with:

In case of flight irregularity, SWISS of course compensate the direct costs incurred by our guests (e.g. for meals, beverages, calls). If you have incurred any direct costs, please send us the receipts of these expenses for reimbursement.
 
I understand that the rebooking you were offered was not ideal. However, alternative flights are subject to availability and agreement of cooperating partners.

Small legroom and mediocre meal,Zurich,San Francisco,International,"For my roundtrip to Prague, I picked Swiss Airlines especially due to their good reviews. However, I have to say that I am a bit disappointed. First of all, I had the opportunity to compare the seat legroom between United and Swiss on the long segments of the flight. Swiss Airline legroom is absolutely small, and to make matter worse, the middle seats have bars going down the middle, so you cannot stretch your feet completely. On the other hand, I flied Economy Plus on United outbound, and the legroom is at least 2x. Lastly, I thought United had terrible enough food for international flights, but little did I know that Swiss is also not much better. Our landing breakfast is only a pizza pocket. And dinner is also nothing to write home about. Overall, I think Swiss is not bad but definitely not the pack leader that I thought they were.",July 2019,"July 20, 2019",3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2.0

Horrible customer service - they couldn't care less,Chicago,Zurich,International,"On arrival in Zurich their agent directed us to the wrong gate for our connecting flight.  We discovered her error and ran all the way to the correct gate.   Fortunately, the passenger shuttle was still there, parked just 20 feet in front of us.  Unfortunately, the gate agent (who I will not make because they told me it is illegal to do so), refused to let us on.  He gave the depart instruction while we were standing there.  Sent us to the transfer gate. They're just automatons as well.  Don't care at all about what happened.  Five hour unplanned and unnecessary layover as the start of our big trip.

Economy class review,Lisbon,Zurich,Europe,"Business class service is great of course since I'm paying premium for it. Whereas Economy is worse. 
I am of average height and normally I do not have issues on the seats but this one is too cramped so imagine how it is for western people. The cabin crew on this flight is not friendly at all. I was seated near the tail area and normally they hand refreshing towels before takeoff. The crew did this however they handed it out to only after 3 rows from the back. I do not get it, why miss the last 3 rows? While I understand that some cabin crews are not happy with their jobs but they shouldn't actually show it in their faces specially when serving meals! Although I am a frequent traveler and I am used to seeing different kind of facial expressions from the crew, at least HR could perhaps do something to encourage the staff. 
My impression is that Swiss Airlines is not up to par with Star Alliance standards. If I would rank the airlines under Star Alliance, they are at the bottom. Food is so-so even in business class. It could be different for long haul flights and I've never taken one from them since I always take Singapore Airlines but within Europe, I would rather choose a different airline if I can avoid it.",July 2019,"July 18, 2019",2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
very good experience with Swiss airlines,Boston,Vienna,International,Flew with family from Boston to Vienna and back from Prague to Boston in July 2019.  Excellent equipment.  Flights were on time.

The on flight snack and breakfast was optimum. A special treat included Swiss chocolates at the end of the flight. The ground staff in Mumbai was understanding of baggage service. For example if a passenger has a baggage allowance of 23 kgs as check in baggage and 8 kgs as cabin baggage and the passenger requests to checkin the cabin baggage as a matter of convenience Swiss Airways ground staff do consider your request and assist where possible.

Swiss and Geneva airport,Canton of Geneva,Nice,Europe,"I have 40 years of international travel experience in developed and developing countries. This is the worst experience ever. Customer service is terrible at check-in and when you send feedback. Rude and abusive staff from Swissport handle the check-in for Swiss at the French sector of the airport. Swiss customer service is not capable of reading an email. Low class employees. you send a customer feedback to Swiss, If you have mobility issues, the service is so bad compared to other international airports and airlines. If you have elderly parents or relatives with a disability , spare them! It borders on harassment and discrimination. Passengers are treated like dirt.

Business aisle seats are a little narrow,Zurich,Bangkok,International,"The seats are a little narrow when you're lying down. Perhaps narrow isn't the best word but it is seat design perhaps. My only complaint is that when I am asleep my arm ends up in the aisle. I couldn't sleep well because I was constantly worried about getting accidentally injured.

If the seats didn't have open space under the arm rest, kind of like the pods on United and United Polaris, this would not have been an issue. It is more of a seat design matter and my preference rather than anything else.

I think the food and the airline otherwise are fabulous. Great service in business. This seat issue is something I've observed with the A380 seats in business on Lufthansa as well.",August 2018,"July 15, 2019",4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
"Superb flight experience, but off-flight service can be improved",Milan,Bangkok,International,"We started our trip from MXP to BKK via ZRH. The flight from MXP took off with a delay of more than 1.5 hours, which made us not only miss visiting the First Class Lounge in Zurich, but worse made us lose our luggage as it did not make the same flight - more to that later.
The inflight experience from ZRH to BKK was spectacular. Very personalised service, excellent food and very comfortable and clean seat spaces. Chapeau to this.
As already mentioned, our luggage did not make the connection and was resent to Singapore, with the effect that while we were up in the air, the luggage had already been redirected. Independent of my booking class, I can expect any sort of information about the whereabouts of my luggage, this did not happen.
In total we received the luggage more than 36 hours after our arrival. My complaint to Swiss had been rejected argueing that the luggage got stuck in BKK (it is worth to mention that our final destination was Phuket and luggage was checked through to HKT). Anyway, the luggage had never seen BKK from the interior nor exterior. I feel that Swiss Service was trying to blame others instead of taking over responsibility. Only after I wrote them again showing them pictures of the luggage tag, the Service department had to admit to their error. At least, I got a recompensation - however, the damage was done by not informing properly and keeping us for almost two days without knowing when to obtain the luggage. 
Our flight was in Business Class - here applies the same: great service and excellent food.
For the flight experience, I can only recommend. The service level outside the plane needs to be improved!",July 2019,"July 15, 2019",4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0
Impossible to submit comments to Swissair,Stockholm,Walvis Bay,International,"I travel quite frequently, more than 10 trips by flight a year, mostly in Europe. KLM, Lufthansa and Swissair have been my favorites. I have not noticed much difference of them until this year. In the beginning of March, I was on a trip to Namibia with Swissair but affected by irregularity. The trip was not pleaseant. On the 15th of March, I issued a complaint to Swissair via Swissair's home page and claimed the compensation I am entitled to. After the submission of my complaint, I received a message on the screen, ""Acknowledgement of receipt. Thank you for your message. You will be receiving a reply from us as soon as possible ‚Ä¶"". I saved a screen dump of this confirmation. 

However, days passed by and I received no response. About 10 days later, I called a support telephone found on Swissair's home page. There, I was told to send a mail to info.us@swiss.com. Following the advice, I did send a mail to info.us@swiss.com and I also received answers. The person who replied me told me that they are not working with public relations. However, if I supply them with my case number, they can have a look of my case anywhere. The problem is that I never received any case number. I sent the screen dump I saved but that did not help. I asked for the mail address to the right persons who are working with public relations but I did not receive any answer to this. Therefore, I came to an end there without being able to go further. Now, 4 months have passed. Still, no response from Swissair. At this moment, I do have good reasons to complain, but there is no way to get into contact with Swissair.

On the contrary, I also affected by an irregularity during a flight with KLM this May. I submitted a complaint to KLM via KLM's home page. Within 2 days, KLM responded to my complaint and the issue was solved very quick. A few years ago, I also affected by an irregularity with a Lufthansa flight.

The worst airline ever!,Valencia,Hannover,Europe,"I took this airline in short and long haul flights and won't recommend this airline.
I have experiences with many other airlines, European, American, Asian. This one is the worst.

1. The worst customer service: 
-didn't help with questions via phone. She even raised her tone.
- The worst one: at check in counter, the staff refused to take off my passport's plastic without reason and asked me to do that. When I refused, she took off the plastic and said that she cancelled my flight because of this incident. I then asked another officer and she defended herself to her. The other officer helped me to check in in anpther counter. They didn't apologize. She lied by saying cancel my flight, there is no right to cancel my flight and her attitude was bad. No control from management. Very poor customer service and no help.
2. In my experience, the flights was always delayed by at least an hour, where at least 20 minutes delayed was inside the cabin.
3. Food was so poor, only sorbet to Z√ºrich.
4. For long haul flight, the entertainment was bad.
5. My baggage was scratched when I got it back. Really bad handling.
6. Bad handling on turbulence. Really scary.
7. Overpriced for their bad service.

What was worse later was that it took almost 48 hours for my luggage to arrive in Mumbai and be delivered to me at my address in Mumbai!

I was almost about to miss my connecting flight from Mumbai to Kolkata because of non-delivery of my checked-in bag!

We had the steak and pasta option. Salad was fresh. Service was attentive. Bathrooms were kept very very clean throughout the flight. In flight movies had great selection.

"Great flight crews, terrible ground staff",Copenhagen,London,Europe,"Let me start with the positive:

All six cabin and flight crews were absolutely excellent. The service and the catering first class.
The captain came into the cabin on two of the flights explaining the reason for the delay being due to air traffic limitations.

Now the reason for my low rating:

My bag did not arrive at London City on June 29. This has happened to me before so I was not overly fussed about it.
I saw in the pir that the bag was due to arrive at LCY on the same plane I was taking back to Zurich July 1.
The ground staff promised to intercept the bag and tag it to BCN.
I received a phone call the next day July 2 from LCY informing me that they had the bag and would send it to BCN that evening.
I furthermore received an email from Swiss baggage handling in Bern on July 4 stating the bag was at BCN and that I should already have received it.
I then received another call from LCY on July 6 telling me the bag was returned to them from Zurich!
They also promised to put it on the flight to Zurich later that day.
Still nothing. I then contacted Swiss again and after several contacts where they said it was not their problem, but it was up to the baggage handling company, they finally contacted LCY.

problem was connection times were very short.
fly from Naples to Zurich then Zurich to Vancouver.
it was a short connection time between flights to begin with - and unfortunately we departed Naples 35 mins late - making connection almost impossible.
flight crew said connecting in Zurich was very easy - get off flight and walk to departure gate.
in fact had to take shuttle bus from tarmac into 1st terminal (bad)
then one in terminal 1 run like crazy to only then find out we had to go through passport control as we were now leaving the EU.
to be honest we had to cut this 40 minute line up - pissing off other travellers (rightfully so!)
then run like crazy down escalators to DOH! a frigging tram to take us to terminal 3!

Never Fly Swiss Air,Chicago,Zurich,International,"Two weeks ago i flew Swiss Air to Zurich.  I usually fly United but to Zurich you fly their Star Alliance partner Swiss Air.  I thought that would be fine but it was not.  Usually I fly Economy Plus to get a little extra leg room but Swiss Air does not have that class (at least not on this aircraft.  The seats are cramped and god forbid if the person in front of you reclines their seat.  The cabin was warm, it never cooled down and the type of aircraft used did not have individual blowers to allow you to adjust the temp or air.  So now you are cramped and hot.  Next I had an aisle seat and on most aircraft the aisle arm rests swing up so you can swing your legs into the aisle and stand up.  But not on Swiss Air or not on this Airbus.  So in the middle of the night when I needed to go to the washroom I had to wake the gentlemen in front of me up so he could sit up and allow me to get out of my set.    

Also I want to comment on the flight crew, over all they were a business like efficient team, but they all seemed like they hated their jobs.  Never smiled, talked little other than the perfunctory questions, chicken or pasta, water or coffee, etc.

Not a good experience,  I would not fly Swiss Air again unless I exhausted all other avenues first.",June 2019,"July 11, 2019",2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0
Well worth it,Zurich,Dublin,Europe,"We had flown Air Lingus from Dublin to Venice but decided that, as we would be travelling back from Zurich, Switzerland that we would take advantage of the cheaper and greater checked-in luggage allowance offered by Swissair, in anticipation of buying bits and bobs during our holiday.
We were not sorry.
I would like to compliment Zurich airport on its very clear announcements for a start. Dublin, please learn.
The plane felt spaceous, comfortable and, of course, was very efficient.
We were especially impressed by the provision of a light lunch of a beautiful quiche with a choice of beverage all within the price, which was so much quicker and better than Air Lingus ( and others‚Äô) method of choices and fiddling about with change or fetching something which is not on the trolly so that the aisle is blocked for an interminable time with people crossing their legs wanting to use the toilet!

We then went back to Qatar counter and the only way to travel was to buy my kids very expensive tickets. I must say  Qatar Airlines was very helpful and courteous . They even upgraded the Swiss economy tickets that had been downgraded to Business.

Great Service On Board- Call Center Customer Service - A Living Hell,Miami,Budapest,International,"So you booked a flight on Swiss, spring for business class are confident that all will go perfectly-think again.
 When I booked our vacation flights on Swiss 6 months in advance, I booked business class hoping that all would be hassle free. Reservations- check, seat reservations-check (I even booked the same seats going and coming).  A few weeks before our flights, I wanted to ensure that everything was in order.  I logged onto the Swiss website and noticed our seats on the outgoing flight were not there. There were also no seats available on the seating chart to book unless I paid the $149 additional for the privacy seats.  I tried messaging Swiss on Twitter and they informed me I needed to call their online call center aka A Living Hell.
  I called the center and explained that I had reserved seats and was told by the agent that there was no record for the seats.  I asked how that could be, I knew I made the reservations for two longest legs of the flight (Mia-ZRH and ZRH-MIami).  The agent told me that I would have to wait until we checked in at the airport to reserve seats or I would have to pay $149 pp to reserve the privacy seats.  I explained that this was unacceptable as I had booked the seats and having paid business class which includes reserved seats, I should be able to reserve them.  After going in circles with her, I asked for her supervisor.  She said there wasn't one there . When I asked how that could be, she informed me there may or may not be one there in a few hours.   When I persisted, she said that since I booked online a travel website which which was code shared with United for the outgoing flight, I would have to contact United.  
 I called United and the agent was extremely sympathetic, but informed me she could not see the seating charts for Swiss on her system.     
  The service on the flights was very attentive and flight attendants were very efficient and friendly.  Once we arrived in Budapest, we waited for our baggage only to find that it did not make the connection.  We had to wait for the baggage on the next flight out of Zurich.

We take a 15 minute bus ride to another terminal; go though security; only to be told at the BA counter that Swiss AIr had not paid for the ticket.  Eventually BA gets it worked out and we fly out a couple of hours delayed but when we reach Geneva our checked bag did not arrive.

Great service just have to get better being on time.,London,Zurich,Europe,"We had to take two flights on Swiss Air one from Heathrow to Zurich and the second from Zurich to Barcelona. When landing on time with Air Canada at Heathrow we noticed our flight on Swiss Air was delayed by 30 minutes. As we were pushing away from the gate we were over an hour behind schedule! 

Something for you to remember is while on the webpage reserving you seats it looks as there are only two x two seats in business class it is not different than economy with three x three with the saying spacing between each row. A little surprised and not overly impressed as that was not what we were expecting. This applies for both flights. The only difference was they do not book the middle seat for you. Personally would not pay the difference for business class based on the seating arrangements. 

The two flight attendants on our first leg were wonderful. The younger of the two constantly had a smile and really seem to be enjoying her position. While both were wonderful the younger just exuded a wonderful disposition it was a pleasure to meet her acquaintance. 

When mentioning we had a connecting flight the flight attendant indicated we would be getting connecting details on monitor ten minutes before landing. For this leg we were a little stressed as we would have less than 30 minutes to clear customs and get to our connecting flight. 

Finally, at the ten minute mark came before landing we received the details about our connecting flight and this to was delayed. While it was our first time flying Swiss Air and we were blessed with the delays as it made our connecting flights still work I can not believe two separate flights were delayed by a minimum of 20 minutes. Without getting into all the details we made the connection and were safely on our way to Barcelona. 

The second flight had two gentlemen serving us in the cabin and both did a wonderful job. On both flights we had a feeling of pride and enjoyment from the flight attendants. 

Another Kudo to Swiss Air is the Captain was present welcoming us on board on both flights and made sure he was also present as we left. Something we don‚Äôt in Canada these days. 

Overall 
Plane - A320 for both - a good reliable plane in good condition. Rating +

Seats - terrible 3x3 and not a lot of room between each row. Rating -

Food - first flight was sliced processed roast beef. Served with cheese and crackers. Second was prosciutto with potato salad and cheese as well. 
Rating - 

People - this is where Swiss Air goes above and beyond. The people were friendly and a pleasure to engage with. Between the Flight Attendants and the Captain coming out of the cockpit they thoroughly impressed us. Rating +++

"Comfortable, good value for money and far less walking than with other airlines",Canton of Geneva,London,Europe,"I've been travelling to London Heathrow by Swiss a few times in the recent months and I can truthfully say that the experience was a lot more pleasant than travelling with other airlines. 
The service is good, the staff well trained and the leather seats comfortable and you feel slightly less cramped than with other airlines. The food (in economy) is not much and frankly they might as well not bother, but otherwise it is good.  
What really makes this airline beat the others is the fact that they have good slots at Geneva and Heathrow airports and therefore the passengers do not have to walk miles either to drop their luggage or to go to the gate.  The planes I have taken haven't always been on time, but one gets to expect some delays these days and it was within the acceptable range.
Swiss offers good value for money if you take into account the fact that the fare includes hold luggage, two pieces of hand luggage (one under the seat) and you can choose your seat, all of which are usually charged extra by other airlines.  You can also change your reservation, for a fee and possibly a bit extra for price difference.

As a result, my girlfriend was hold for a some time, and she was asked to show her documents again to perform further checks. I found this a bit unusual and distressful, but, hey, 2 issues can happen, right? Once finally aboard, after a while, the crew started giving around a small snack to all passengers. Well, all except one: my girlfriend. I thought, maybe they did not see her, although she was sitting just beside me? But hey, 3 issues can happen, right? Later on, the crew start distributing the main meal...and once again they serve it to all....except my girlfriend, so I had to call the crew back to get her meal (and yes, it was included in her ticket, if you are wondering...).But hey 4 mistakes can happen right? Sure the fact that they happened all against the same person is unusual, though. The hours passed and the crew brought the ice cream to all passengers; well of course all, except my girlfriend. At this point, I went to the back of the plane where a group of hostesses are talking to one other (I would have preferred them to look after the passengers), and I asked if I could have had an ice cream for my girlfriend. One of them went immediately on a defensive mode, rising the voice against me (not to say yelling), saying she did not serve my girlfriend because she was sleeping (which I can assure she was not). I am not sure why this hostess had such bad attitude, and I told her I found it inappropriate. Also, I wondered why my girlfriend, who was the only dark skinned person (she is Thai) among many white passengers around us, was the only one to be repetitively ignored. A simple apologie would have sufficed, instead that hostess  (too bad I cannot recall her name) was acting in a very hostile manner, which I found very upsetting, to the point that I decided to return the 2  ice cream tubs that her colleague gave me, dropping them back in their plastic containers (at the point she made really upset making me lose completely my appetite). I decided then to go back to my seat and try and relax, closing my eyes. A few minutes later another hostess came, and although I had my eyes closed and I was clearly trying to get some rest, she did not bother to wake me up (but they did not not serve snack, mean meal and ice cream to my girlfriend, because, they said, it looked like she was sleeping..? So what is the company policy?). She told me she was the Maitre the Cabine, and asked me if I wanted to talk about the incident: I did not want to make a big fuss, so I said everything was alright, and that at the moment all I needed was to relax and rest. But she (her name is Susanne Kaufmann) insisted, then started yelling at me, accusing me to have been rude to her team. Furthermore, clearly abusing her power, she threatened me to get me arrested on arrival (for what, since I was actually the offended person, not the offender?). Although I do appreciate a manager that stick to his team and protect them when the team is right, this was definitely  not the case, so I found  it totally unprofessional. As I told Ms Kaufmann, she was not at the back of the plane, when the discussion happened with her team, so she could not really know what had happened there and accuse me of anything. I would have expected from a person in her position to at least ask for also my version of facts, before accusing me of anything and threatening me. This is a simple basic of management. The captain on arrival to Zurich did not contact me before leaving the plane, nor I have I been contacted by any customer service from Swiss Air  so far,  so I wonder if Ms Kaufman had reported the incident. The rest of the crew was actually nice, but my flying experience and the following holidays have been severely affected, pretty much ruined, by the appalling attitude of one hostess and her Maitre de Cabine. So, it did not come as a big surprise, when I saw so many other review regarding the terrible service with this airline.",June 2019,"July 2, 2019",1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0

Terrible Business Class experience!,Zurich,Sao Paulo,International,"I booked  a flight to my wife to visit her sick father to Sao Paulo. Only available was J class meaning full business fare (4500CHF+ on the way out) and she would have expected a better experience from Swiss. The misadventures were multiple including fear for her safety.
The flight was overbooked and didn‚Äôt manage to have a seat allocated at check-in, although the choice was made a time of booking. She was told she may have one at the gate. Premium passengers should not worry and be stressed in wondering if they will fly and if they do in the class they booked. 
Then after boarding, she thought she had taken someone else seat (4D right after First class) as it looked dirty and occupied. 
‚Ä¢	Sock on the floor
‚Ä¢	Used earplugs in the drawer.
‚Ä¢	Headphone off the plastic. 
‚Ä¢	She asked the crew what happened to the seat, and the answer was: ‚ÄúOh the seat may have not been cleaned‚Äù!

Finally, as it is not all, during TAKE OFF, the stack of magazines and newspapers fell on her head and her neighbour because the crew simply FORGOT to remove them before taking off. The crew just wondered after take-off why all those magazines and newspapers were on the floor. I am sure this is a breach of air safety. 

To conclude, she and I are very appalled that paying a full fare business she had to go through dirty seat and fear for her safety on a thought ‚Äúpremium airline‚Äù. 
We will have to fly often to Sao Paulo, I will hesitate to fly Swiss or Lufthansa Group (I had other bad experience with them) and will prefer other carriers with which I had good experience, even if it means paying more and/or fly via another hub. With my friends based in Geneva or Basel, we all agree that going to Brazil on business class KLM is the best. 
She is back in tomorrow and I hope her flight experience stays with a minimum discomfort, if not we will approach newspapers. Not a premium airline.",July 2019,"July 1, 2019",1.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0

Too many mistakes!,Budapest,Chicago,International,"Paid $100 each for upgrade seats.  Got the bulkhead in the third cabin with no window (dark) with the restrooms and galley.  Although people were cautioned not to line up in those areas at the outset of the trip, nevertheless, they did.  All during the flight we had no privacy just people staring at us, helping themselves to drinks in the galley (would you believe?) and waiting to use the restrooms.  It was awful!  After complaining that the upgrade was not really an upgrade in our opinion since we didn't need the extra leg room, the attendant was extremely concerned and checked our reservation.  Then he offered us other seating which we declined since it was worse than where we were.

We also ordered diabetic meals which they did not have or did not even have it noted on our reservations.  Again, this same attendant took time to check it out, came back and apologized.  There was no such reservation despite my husband having it listed on his profile.  He shared that we must notify the ticket office at the time of the reservation to make that notation.  And if it wasn't on the first flight (which it wasn't) we should have notified them so we get it on the connecting flight.  Also, he reported that meals get messed up when a travel agent books the flight.
Another lesson learned.

Boeing 777 new plane but cramped,Singapore,Zurich,International,"Took this airline to Sarajevo, and the Long leg from Singapore to Zurich was an overnight flight. We were supposed to leave at 11 but flight was delayed at least an hour and half. The only consolation was that they offered some drinks before takeoff and pacified us. The reason given by the captain was that the airspace over India was very crowded, not sure how true that was.
Now, the reason why I rated 2 Star is because of the cramped economy seats. I have flown on many triple sevens before but these seats are very cramped and will not suit European size at all. And then there are these light weight seats that are very thin at the cushions. When on Long flights, the buttocks will be sore from sitting on these thin cushions. These are very similar to Budget airline seats like Scoot or even lower tier airlines like KLM.
I would suggest for Swiss to relook at the seating configuration and to improve on the seats‚Äô cushioning.
Other areas like servicing is also not up to par. The crew members seems to be looking very stressed all the time, and one even spilled orange juice on another passenger when in a hurry to serve. The crews seem to be always in a hurry to serve everyone, especially when in a full flight situation.
Overall, the experience was not good and very unpleasant  as a passenger when faced with overworked and stressful crews.",June 2019,"June 29, 2019",2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0

Not a great ending,Zurich,Dublin,Europe,"Returning from holiday is not normally something we look forward to for most people so our flight home can certainly cushion the experience if it goes smoothly.
Unfortunately for us returning from a holiday in Switzerland recently, our flight with Swiss Air ended rather badly. We took off with only perhaps a 10 minute delay and actually landed in Dublin 5 minutes early but then the problems began. We were left sitting on the tarmac for 1 hour and thirty five minutes before dis-embarking, one service announcement telling us very little, a refusal to use the toilets because ‚Äú we may move at any moment ‚Äú and no offer of water while we sat in the heat. One would imagine that after two hours they could have at least opened a door a fraction to air the aircraft, after all we were just sitting still, but  no, on health and safety grounds we should sit still, on full bladders and breath stale air. Eventually people decided they‚Äôd use the bathroom regardless of instructions and did so forming an orderly queue and within minutes we had an announcement to say we could use them and stretch our legs for a few minutes but to sit down if the seat belt sign came on... we could have done that 30 minutes earlier and people would have been a lot happier. Why an airline flys into an airport without a dis-embarking slot I‚Äôm not sure, is it their fault or the airports, who knows but your main priority as an airline should be the comfort of your passengers and that was not apparent here.
Finally after getting off we had a further 45 minute wait for our baggage... the whole experience being longer than the flight with one announcement of no value being their sole explanation.I was expecting an email of some type the following day explaining the delays but no contact of any type or post on their website.
I‚Äôll not fly with them again if I can help it, as I say I don‚Äôt know who is to blame but information is key to travelers and keeping them in the dark and expecting them to just accept a given situation without explanation is not the correct course of action...

Good Airline could be made much better!!,New Delhi,Zurich,International,"Flight was delayed unusually, Airlines ground staff was least helpful and they had no clue how to deal with the situation. Ultimately when flight was announced it was 3 hours late and they refused to give priority to people with young children despite repeatedly requesting them. On flight only a small breakfast was served with no drinks. Usually when a flight is so delayed, a heavier meal should be served and drinks should be offered. Seats were very tight in economy class due to 3-4-3 configuration rather than 2-3-2 or better configuration.

"Flew both business and economy Nice-Johannesburg, both very poor service/aircraft",Nice,Johannesburg,International,"I had the 'experience' of flying Swiss from Nice to/from Johannesburg via Zurich in both business (outward) and economy (back). I have flown Swiss in the distant past and had memories of pleasant experiences - I was in for several disappointments.
On the positive side: the flights left more or less on time (except the Zurich-Jo'burg flight which was held back to wait for late connecting passengers). The planes were reasonably clean. That's it.
Business Class review - poor, and I do travel business regularly with other airlines. Seats were very hard and very narrow. Old technology - seats and in-flight entertainment system, e.g. VERY small screens. Airplane was REALLY old. Food was very poor for Business Class-level. Service (call that service?) was unfriendly, reluctant, distant and the whole thing was 'minimalist'. And expensive compared to other airlines - I only took Swiss because everyone else was booked. What a miserable bunch of people - the aircrew I mean.
The way back - Economy - of course was worse. On the Jo'burg-Zurich leg it was the same 'team' as the way out, just a different aeroplane (newer). The aircrew were even more cold and distant in Eco, unless you were one of the very few German-speaking passengers. Talking of which, the crew persisted in talking German to everyone, even though - after many hours - no one had actually learned German during the flight. Persistence to the point of rudeness. Not only that, my (old-fashioned, tiny, buggy) in-flight entertainment system would ONLY select German as the main language! Basically the crew had the same approach as a Swiss domestic flight where 99% of the passengers are going to be Swiss, and operating out of Zurich, probably speak German. But this is an intercontinental flight going through Zurich as a hub, with the majority being English-speaking (native or otherwise), and absolutely NOT German. On my flight it was probably 99% non-German-speaking.
Food service was very poor and disjointed, e.g. we got a drink and crackers 1-hour into the flight - OK. Then the crew disappeared for over 2-hours! Was that all we were getting for dinner, I thought? Got myself ready to sleep, and yippee, at 22:30 they started serving some food (3-hours into the flight). Food was 'OK' for Eco, I suppose, but the miserable faces and below minimal service dragged out the sub-standard dinner service to past midnight.
Very poor.
Here's an interesting point to note - please bear with me. A while ago I read some research about people's memories, and companies make use of this approach to manipulate us. Let me explain. People form opinions based on the last 5-10 minutes of an experience, like was it good, pleasant, bad, painful, etc. For example, if you go to the dentist for a painful treatment, as you leave he will be nice to you, give you a smile and maybe a candy(?), have a chat about the kids, etc. Then, later, what you remember is how nice he was, not how painful the treatment was - you get the idea?
Well, SWISS must have learned this and apply it. The whole flight was poor, uncomfortable, expensive, with cold, minimalist, rude, staff. BUT in those last few minutes, as we're queuing to get off, suddenly they are all smiles, warm and chatty (in ENGLISH and German), helpful, etc. So what will our memories be? Didn't work for me, as you can tell from this review.
I do NOT recommend Swiss.
Other points: Zurich airport - the business lounge closes (as do the shops) at 21:30, and the food etc. is gone long before that. On the way back (in Eco) passengers were forced to check in hand luggage if they had more than 2-pieces. This was NOT done nicely, politely, voluntarily (I actually remembered this from the past, but had forgotten). I could describe the manners, language and approach that would give you a good idea how she worked, but let me just say that she would have been ideal for a certain police service 80 years ago who liked to wear armbands and walked funny.

Very Good Business Class Cabin Experience,Los Angeles,Zurich,International,"I have flown Swiss on several occasions, each time in Business Class cabin. This trip was last minute and I literally found seats the day prior to the flight, so I took the last seat available literally! The configuration on the 777-300 is 2-2-2 (though there are a few rows with a 1-2-1). I was the last row and in the middle. This is my least favorite seat, but it was really decent and the rest of the appealing features of flying Swiss made up for it. Under normal circumstance, I would pay the small extra fee to have the lone window seats which afford more privacy.
The seat was comfortable, and even for a 6'2"" guy like myself it was sufficiently wide for the 12 hrs flight. When reclined to a bed, its flat, with no bumps and creases and the feet well doesn't tapper too much which is good. There are also a fair number of useful storage areas within the seating are which offer good places to stash your belongings. The overall styling of the cabin is tasteful, and the seat upholstery is fabric which is comfortable and looks stylish.

Ok, but why do I have to fly alone via Moscow, my husband via Hongkong and my 2 year old alone via Vienna to Z√ºrich???
The boarding gate crews said I need to talk with Swiss Check In Counter. We followed the crew to re-Enter Japan and pick up the baggages and go to the counter again.
The crew was of course busy with other customers and always on the phone not being able to respond all the customer.
After waiting 3 hours, they suggested to call Swiss Airline customer service through the phone to coordinate our flights.
I tried to call the number which they suggested...again, busy signals for a while.
Finally our line got connected and spoke with the phone center and explained the situation. The operator suggested to fly with Australia air which departures in 1.5 hours from that moment... Well that is such a short notice and they did not even guarantee that my 2 years old can sit next to me or with my husband...
The operator suggested to fly on next day all together with other airline. 
I asked her if the hotel is paid the we can take the next day ticket. The operator said I have to ask the  Checkin Counter for the hotel.
The Check in Clerk said as long as within the budget, they pay the hotel and started to call some hotels.
After back and forth the check in counter and operator conversation for 5 hours, we finally settled down with the next day flight with the hotel paid by Swiss Airline.
Now back in Swiss and claiming the hotel cost etc, Swiss Airline refused to pay the hotel fee...
This is totally wrong. The announcement said this flight cancellation was technical reason so EU regulation should apply.
We have paid more to fly with Swiss Air (direct to NRT) but ended up via other country which was a lot cheaper. This difference is also not paid and the hotel fee which they said that will pay is not paid.

Unfriendly & fleeting service,Singapore,Sarajevo,International,"I flew more than 12 hours from Singapore to Sarajevo, connecting in Zurich. This is my first flying experience with Swiss Air, I have to say, I did have expectations on the inflight service since Switzerland is known for its hospitality.

The flight was delayed, I couldn‚Äôt quite hear what the reason was as the First Officer was mumbling on the PA system. 

20 minutes have passed, water was served, so I thought, that‚Äôs not too bad. 

Finally, the plane took off and there was some ambiguity explanation on will the delay affect passengers with connecting flight. So not much help there. But luckily, when landed, the info. was published on inflight entertainment unit. 

The meals was served past midnight local time, since I couldn‚Äôt sleep, I ate supper. The service was not friendly, quite blunt and no smile. Surprisingly, the crew didn‚Äôt bother to ask but it‚Äôs up to passengers to order. When I asked for a bottle of water so that I can keep myself hydrated, it was begrudgingly given to me. 

Lavatory in the flight was filthy, wet and smelly. Somehow, the basin is tugged into the wall so when I tried to rinse my mouth while brushing teeth, it‚Äôs hard not to get the floor wet. 

During the connecting flight, I was resting my eyes during takeoff. Somehow, the crew managed to zoom past me when serving breakfast. So I didn‚Äôt have anything to eat nor drink. When I use the lavatory, I saw some passengers asking for water, the crew gave a grim face at first, then decided to shut the curtain all together so that nobody can find them.

The worst airline to fly,Zurich,Dubai,International,"This airline is hands down the worst airline I have flown over and over.  I've flown this leg multiple times and every single time it's miserable. I have never reviewed an airline before but this last trip was so bad that I wanted to speak out.  Here are the chief complaints.
- You can't change your seat - My flight was booked through a travel agency.  It was through a United bid because I can change my United seats but not SWISS.  Every time I go to board it's seat roulette. Sometimes it's an isle, sometimes middle.  The only thing that is consistent is that the representatives at SWISS have absolutely no desire to try and help me change my seat. They are extremely rude. 
- The food is garbage - I have a gluten allergy (not the fake, hey I think it's cool to be gluten free kind). There is no way with my ticket to tell them that I have an allergy so I just have to wait and see what slop they bring then I have to eat usually a garbage salad.  Although the passengers around me always eat about half their meal before getting turned off so I can't imagine it would be great either way. 
- My headsets or screens rarely work - I have flown this leg multiple times and almost every time there is an issue with the entertainment system. This last time I couldn't hear anything. Of course when I asked for a new headset the flight attendant said she would bring me one and never did. 
- The leg room is a joke - I am 6'3"" and I can't even touch my knees together when I am in the seat.  This is why an isle seat is so important.  Of course I can't get an isle seat because hey that would be too convenient. 

All in all SWISS is a joke. I recently had the change to book my own flight to Zurich next month and I chose to take a flight with a stop over instead of a direct just so I didn't have to fly the airlines.",June 2019,"June 13, 2019",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Mortifying experience... one of the worst airlines + worst customer service,Zurich,Mumbai,International,"I used to travel a lot with Swiss Air and believed they were amongst best in the business, until they proved me wrong. End of May 2019, I flew with them to Mumbai. The flight was nothing less than a nightmare. Nobody was allowed to check-in (choose a seat) online. Everyone got their seats at the gate, right before entering the flight. The flight was full (which is not their fault) and I got a middle seat. Being claustrophobic, I literally cannot sit in the middle (or in a window seat). The flight staff could not help me with anything; luckily, the person sitting next to me offered me their seat, ending my nightmare. BTW, I had called all possible customer service-lines prior to checkin-in in order to book an aisle seat as I couldn't do it online, but nobody could help me!! Most of them were also very rude :O

Moreover, I had pre-booked gluten-free meals for all my flights, but I was given 'normal' bread on all my flights (to and from Mumbai). Upon asking, the flight attendant told me they were not gluten-free and took them back (all other airlines offer gf bread). I am really really really disappointed with their service. I would give them negative rating, unfortunately, one is the least option available. Cannot believe they used to be one of the best airlines :(",May 2019,"June 12, 2019",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Nightmare - worth reading,New York City,Moscow,International,"Had a really bad experience going to Russia with Swiss. Had a connection in Geneva where they checked our visas to make sure they were good and we were on our way.  When I arrive at DME there's an issue with my visa and I'm not allowed in the country, they told me I would have to work it out if I wanted to return.  It was approximately 15:00, they told me a rep from Swiss would be coming to put me on a flight at 18:00 to zurich, then to NY and they placed me in a room.  Unfortunately the rep never came, I wasn't being given water and I was starting to get stressed.  Eventually at 19:00 the security guard came and told me I would be put on a flight back to New York the next morning at 9 am and I would be expected to just stay in that room, with no water, until then.  I asked if I bought my own flight if I could leave, he said yes.  So I quickly caught the next flight out of the country, to Baku, where I figured out my visa stuff.  I came back to Russia friday with no problems.  My original return flight was from Bergen Norway, I arrive at that airport a week or so later to find that my return flight had been cancelled.  I had refused the flight back to new york and since I never consented there was no reason that they should have cancelled my return flight.  A very nice woman from SAS called swiss and lufthansa and asked them to do something about it, they refused.  Then I wrote a letter to customer service at swiss and was also told it was my responsibility.  Those two additional flights cost me over $1700, and I'm sure if this were another airline they would've at least given me some sort of credit.

"The  reservation system seems outdated, not integrated with partners and call centre are not at right level",Canton of Geneva,Cape Town Central,International,"I was trying to book seats for a party of 4 departing from 2 different airports to go to Cape Town on an Edelweiss charter ,two in business, two in economy with a hope that accumulated miles could be used. In the end, I had to get my travel agent to take care of it. I agree that the set up was a bit complicated but I do feel that the way I was sent from the call centres of miles & more to Swiss to Edelweiss with nobody taking responsibility was a bit too much. We are in 2019, when systems are supposed to be integrated and customer friendly, when call centre staff are expected to take complex calls covering for system short comings, when partners work together to deliver a flawless customer support.
In addition to this, pricing is all over the place. A business travel seat was close to 8 times more expensive than economy. If you get the additional flight from Geneva, the cost is considerably cheaper than the single flight from Zurich.

SERIOUSLY BAD ACROSS ALL ASPECTS!!!,Hong Kong,Zurich,International,"Never again...

First impressions count... And mine of SWISS AIRLINES (HELVETIC) were in a word.. BAD!

Staff apearance/presentation was poor; most in need of an pressed/ironed shirt or blouse and neatly groomed hair.

Staff attentiveness was in general very lacking and when in evidence was for the most part 'ungenuine'. Body language and periodic frowns and miserable faces could be seen. 

After a simple and friendly attempt to 'break the ice' and gain a little interest/attention from one male flight attendant; which failed and resulted in me letting him know I found him dismissive, even rude... I was immediately treated with him calling the police for when the plane landed. And this threat made infront of other dismayed passengers.

I was made to feel scared, bullied, profiled and extremely vulnerable to the suggestion my comment/behaviour warranted being arrested on arrival once the plane landed. 

I saw this as provocative and a serious abuse of power by a cabin member who was rightly told he was being rude. 

Needless to say I walked away immediately and duly reported him to the head cabin crew, who although seemingly understanding clearly saw the incident as not significant. 

Shock horror!!!!..for the remaining part of my flight I say numb, sickened and perplexed by what happened. 

EVEN my next flight from Zurich to Birmingham UK failed to impress. 

Clearly there is a seriously questionable institional staff culture within SWISS AIR that rightly places it well behind the likes of Emirates, Cathay Pacific etc...

SWISS AIR WAS HORRIBLE,Amsterdam,Zurich,Europe,"HORRIBLE. Will never fly with Swiss again. I‚Äôve traveled near and far and every other airline I‚Äôve ever been on has had impeccable customer service in times of trouble. I flew from Amsterdam to Zurich today and my bag was lost somehow (even thought it was a direct flight only lasting an hour and my traveling companion‚Äôs bag was received immediately). When I first approached the customer service rep in Zurich airport baggage claim she was rude, unaccommodating and unapologetic. She offered no help in mending the situation. I am now in Switzerland with zero belongings, besides the books and charging cables which were in my carry on. After fussing with service reps I was told to file a report. Finally the bag was located STILL IN AMSTERDAM airport! The bag contained thousands of dollars of belonging and somehow SWISS is allowed to have a policy that only issues $100 of replacements to passengers flying in economy, BUT issues $300 to those in first class. ABSURD. I have been on and off the phone all day, completely ruined/wasted a day of my vacation, have been offered no reparations for the airlines mistake and here I am 12 hours later still waiting to find out when I will get my bag back and how. The worst experience I‚Äôve ever had while traveling and I will not advise anyone to use Swiss air again. There are far better airlines that have higher focus on customer service and are more apologetic for their mistakes as well as try to help you in mending them. I am not angry that the bag was lost, as I understand this is a risk any traveler takes when checking a bag however I am irate in the way it was handled both in the airport and on the customer service phone lines throughout the day. Also a $100 stipend could buy me a new pair of sandals and a bra here in Switzerland, an outrageous offering from a multi billion dollar company that obviously cares little about customer comfort and satisfaction. Hopefully my bag turns up soon. Do not check bags with Swiss air unless you fully understand their ridiculous policy surrounding reparations for lost baggage. I wish I hadn‚Äôt. I wish there were a zero star option",June 2019,"June 1, 2019",1.0,,,,,,,,
Zurich lounge worst food in industry,Zurich,San Francisco,International,"The food service at the Zurich lounge by the E gates was the worst I have encountered in several years.

There was some cheap white and red wine, along with ordinary beer.  There was no cheese, no crackers, no fresh fruit other than bananas.  They had some rolls that were edible.

The bed, with extra mattress and duvet and a fluffy pillow, combined with Zimmerli quality pyjamas make the rest very comfortable.

Flight Diversion and Abandoned Passengers,Zurich,Florence,Europe,"This flight was an absolute nightmare! As we approached Florence the captain announced that, due to rain and wind, we were diverting to Pisa. The gentleman sitting next to us, obviously a regular on this route,  rolled his eyes and told us that Swiss always does this. He said they are the only airline that frequently does this. We were told that there would be buses available to transport us to Florence. When we arrived at Pisa airport the captain and crew said goodbye -- they should also have said ""good luck, you're on your own now"". There was absolutely no one at the terminal to give us any direction. We all  picked up our bags and assembled at a main exit, waiting for someone to give us direction.  After an hour there were no buses and no one had come to help us. Finally, someone saw two tour buses parked several hundred meters away on the parking lot. These buses were closed, with no lights or drivers visible, but we all walked in the pouring rain and assembled by these two coaches, hopeful but uncertain that these were ours. Finally two drivers strolled over, climbed in the buses and started the engines. Then it was a free for all! Everyone ran to the buses, where we had to open the luggage bins ourselves and load our bags underneath the coach.  For some seniors this was a terrible ordeal so I, and others. had to climb into the bins to help load and  organize the bags. The drive to Florence airport took over an hour and, once there, we were dropped off at the taxi queue and waited  another half hour to get cabs.

All fine until you have an issue... The crew nice but the desk clerks are a shame...,Zurich,San Jose,International,"I had an issue at the airport then I had arrived at the gate 8 minutes before the plain has to leave. First in an awful tone one of the clerks lie to me saying is too late the plain had gone (when I could see the plane in the back with the boarding stuff on it) she did not give the option to ask the captain in order to see if he let me in. 
After that I went to another desk to see what the airline could do for me; first, the clerk the only thing that said over and over again is ""Your flight had arrived with enough time to you get your connection on time (What a new! I mean I had never stated that the flight had arrived late, I told her I had arrived minutes ago to the gate because I had an issue (10 minutes lost in nothing, also I was able to see that the plane I had to get was not leave yet) 
Ok, they send me outside in order to book another flight, the clerk (as the other ones) looked at me and said that if I want to get another flight I will need to pay because all was my fault (Once again I had never said was the airline fault, for sure were my fault I booked with them for the first instance)
In the end the clerk only could book me flights in dates that are out of my needs; so I asked her to look if there is another airline that has flights to my last destiny, she looked at me and draw a little smile saying ""if you fly with us you need to pay little amount, but if you go to another airline they will give you a ticket but for a price you could not get the ticket"" (I mean how much could be that 10 billion dollars or something. How she knows I could not afford to pay a ticket?) She told me Iberia, Air France, and British Airways could have tickets, but she could not buy them for me (normal, because she is from another airline) When I went out from the desk, I told her to thank you and I will go to the other airlines and she got back to me with ""I will wait for you, when you could not book in another airline"". In the end, thank God Iberia and British Airways have flights and the better one was Iberia, so I booked my flight and came back to my country. 
What annoyed me the most is not that I had to book another flight, what really got me on my nerved is that the staff lied to me and try to belittle me.
The last thing I would do in my life is to book another flight with this airline that has a ""customer service"" that try to blame instead of help, and then try to humiliate the customer just because they think we do not have the money to pay a service. I guess that I will fly with this airline if there is ANY other that offer the connection I need (Hope to not need it) 
And please people do not save 100$ in a ticket, use an airline that not only provides you with a good service on board, in the end when a customer has a problem is when we need GOOD SERVICE...

The flight as usual was very nice.  I appreciate the vegetarian options in the menu and the food is not bad.  Instead of a large evening meal and breakfast,  we were served a large lunch and a few smaller snacks.  Frequent drink service is awesome and so are the little Swiss chocolate bars.

Not what you may expect from legendary Swiss quality,Zurich,New York City,International,"I was traveling on a business trip to Poland flying to Cracow from NYC with the LOT Polish Airlines. My return flight was from Warsaw thru Zurich and back to NYC. It was my first time flying with Swiss, I usually fly either with Lufthansa or LOT on my trips to Poland. Although the Warsaw to Zurich is a short flight when you don't expect anything extraordinary from any airlines, the leg from Zurich to NYC was a pretty disappointing experience. I was seated in the 42E seat at the back of the aircraft (A 330)where the middle row narrows from 4 to 3 abreast. The seat was EXTREMELY narrow and tight, I had to literally squeeze myself into it with absolutely no room on either side and without any chance to shift even in the slightest. I am noty a particularly big man, wearing 38 size pants and being 5:10 tall. This was probably the most uncomfortable seat I have ever been on a long distance flight, far worse from either Lufthansa or LOT. during the flight I was planing to do some work, but it was impossible to open even a 15-inch laptop, so I had to abandon that before I even started.
Food that we were offered was only a vegetarian meal, and being a Texan it is not my particular kind at all, I do understand that some people are veggie-eaters but still vast majority aren't. Very disappointing. On the bright side, flight attendants were very polite, professional and attentive, entertainment and movie choice was satisfactory, and the  aircraft looked clean and well maintained on the outside and inside.
Overall, I was pretty disappointed, because this was not a quality of flight I was expecting from a Swiss company. I will not recommend Swiss for a long-haul flights and will stick with LOT or Lufthansa for my trips to Poland in the future, since I know already what to expect from both.",May 2019,"May 21, 2019",3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0

Thank you SwissAir!,Bordeaux,New York City,International,"Thank you SwissAir for holding the plane in Zurich until all connecting passengers arrived!   Haven't seen that since the 80's.

Also appreciated the crew  providing a drink service while we all had to wait for another hour+ on the plane once the doors were closed for the restricted air space over France to clear.  

Sadly, tight legroom, very uncomfortable seat when in upright position, and once in recline, the seat in front of you really encroaches on your space. but the other factors overrode these concerns.

Throne seat!,Zurich,Montreal,International,"A333 ZRH-YUL in 10A.  Traveling  with my partner we were originally seated in 7AC together.  The most private Business class seats are kept reserved for Swiss‚Äô most loyal customers (HIN) so can‚Äôt be booked unless you pay a few extra hundred dollars on top of what you paid for your business class seat.  However, if they are still available at online check-in you can move yourself into them. We moved into 10A (throne) and 14K (mini throne).  Look at the seatmap and photos online to understand why these are much more private and give you more room than the majority of seats. All business class seats are not created equally on Swiss.  However, I think all seats would be good.  Note that the sleeping position is true horizontal lie-flat.  This is unlike Lufthansa‚Äôs angled lie flat.  The footwell is small and varied somewhat.  The footwells in the non-bulkhead throne seats are narrower than the average seat.  I believe any bulkhead seat has larger than average footwells.  Sleeping isn‚Äôt a high priority on this east to west flight but the size of the footwell is surprisingly important if sleeping, particularly if you are tall so this may be one reason to avoid the throne seat ( the other being not sitting beside your partner , however you are also not beside a stranger).   The IFE screens are a bit on the small side but adequate.  The crew, food and service were fantastic.  I was worried it would be underwhelming given there is a first class cabin on this plane but quite the opposite.  Significantly better than Lufthansa and noticeably better than Air Canada which I like.  The Swiss business lounge at ZRH was the best we have been in worldwide.  The food was really good and lots of choice.  The space is large and nice.  There is an outdoor area and the view is fantastic.  If you are a plane spotter you can watch activity on all three runways and for one runway the takeoff point is directly in front of the lounge, close and unobstructed.

Never again,Canton of Geneva,Palma de Mallorca,Europe,"Our flight was on 9th May. We decided to use this airline even it was double price comparing with other low cost airlines because departing time was good (12h ish). We had a 2 yo boy, so timing is a big thing for us. After we booked a couple days, they changed our flight automatically to 19h without asking us anything. So we tried to fix it and apparently they canceled the 12h flight (I guess there‚Äôs not enough people to fly). So they offered us to take 11h flight, but transit in Zurich. We took it as we‚Äôd like to arrive Palma in the afternoon, but we were not so happy as we paid more (without luggage) expecting to have a good flight, but turned out the total time of traveling was worse than other airlines.
Anyway, the flight from Zurich to Palma was delayed for 1 and half hrs. During taking off time, my son vomited a lot. So once we were allowed to release the seat belt, I was blocked by the food trolley to go to the toilet to change. The steward was very nice, he went to ask the air hostess who took care of business class if I could use the toilet that i have to pass by business class, she allowed...Then I went there waiting someone came out of the toilet. She was preparing food there, and looked at me in the annoying way. Then she told me to go wait in the business section (more like, get out of my space, you annoy me). So I was trying to tell her I had vomit all over me, it would smell and look disgusting in her business class‚Äôs people‚Äôs eyes. But she didn‚Äôt listen to me, she cut me and repeat ‚Äúgo to wait outside‚Äù. I was like wow...what a great attitude!

Originally I had left a 4hr layover in the USA to have time to re-check my baggage and go through all security check. The Swiss employee scheduled a completely different flight with a 2hr layover. It took us 2 hours just to get to the next terminal without even going through the TSA checks. We completely missed the flight and they had to put us on a stand by list.

The bad news: After already having our passports checked and processed on entry, we had to go through a SECOND time, JUST for Swiss Air, which left many people missing their flights, as this took some time.  Worse still, my wife's boarding pass was-allegedly- ""randomly assigned"" for a more detailed security check, which included a form of fingerprinting, not being with me while being insulted and told to ""cooperate"", and being left feeling like a suspected terrorist.

We were extremely devastated and furious as it was our honeymoon trip and we've arranged all activities and meals at fine dinning restaurants! 

We had high hopes on receiving the next day but it was a further disappointment, we had been calling every 30 mins and they simply said "" it's lost, we can't locate and update any status at all"". At that moment, i burst into tears in the street and our honeymoon has officially ruined by Swiss. It was extremely stressful mentally and physically to chase for an updated status while we are traveling. Repurchasing all our clothing etc was not the worst, it's the physiological damages and the stress killed our honeymoon. We also had to pay for our hotel in Capri for a private courier service to transfer the luggage to Capri at the end! It was 6 days later when we received our luggage and the trip is almost finished!

We paid so much to fly in business class and clearly this is unacceptable! We will never fly with Swiss nor recommend our family and friends to! DO NOT FLY WITH THEM, THEY WILL RUIN YOUR HOLIDAY",April 2019,"May 5, 2019",1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,

Old A340‚Äôs really need an update,Zurich,Boston,International,"Flew Swiss A340 from Zurich to BOS in economy class.   The inflight service from the staff was very good, the issue is the age of the equipment and the inability to book seats in advance.  First, the seats are old and the cushioning is worn out.  Second, the inflight entertainment system didn‚Äôt work, and when I switched seats with my son, it was a relic from 15-20 years ago.  Poor quality of choices and sound quality was poor.  It was really outdated.   Third, avoid seat G where the under seat space is partly occupied by the inflight entertainment system box.   Fourth, we were unable to order a special meal in advance, adding further agony to our 8 hour flight.  Lastly, we had booked our flight several months in advance using United frequent flyer miles, but were unable to book seats.  I called 24 hrs before the flight departed and they said they couldn‚Äôt accommodate us then either.  This may have to do with our lack of status on Star alliance and our use of frequent flyer tickets.  If this is the case, it‚Äôs a poor policy given the number of flights we suffered through to accrue the mileage necessary for a redemption.  Very frustrating.

Not acceptable,New Delhi,Paris,International,"Sorry to have to contradict myself as the outbound flight from Paris CDG to Delhi via Zurich had been excellent. 
But what happened on our return flight from mIndia recently, is not acceptable.

Only a few hours before travelling from Delhi, we received a message cancelling the booked arrangements with SWISS. No reason given, only ""sorry for the inconvenience"" !
Furthermore, we received a series of contradicting messages with the new flights details on Lufthansa. Initially with 2 connecting flights in Germany, eventually only one in Munich.
As a result, we had no choice for our seats and although paying a premium fare to travel on business class, we sat next to the galley and toilets for a longer flight than expected. Again no reason given on board !
Been transferred from one airline to another, we felt like being treated as second-class citizens, Lufthansa crex being keener pleasing their fellow crew members travelling free than paying guests.
Of course, any further diet requirements were not passed to Lufthansa and when complaining about the situation, we were faced with rudeness and an extraordinary unfriendly and unnecessary attitude. (The following rating reflect the Lufhansa flight)

SWISS and Lufthansa are part of the Star Alliance group. This does not reflect well on any of the other members of the Alliance (esp with disastrous business class connections within India with Air India).
An experience not to renew.

Swiss Lounge in Terminal E was a disappointment. Felt like a cafe rather than a lounge. I waited for over 2 hours and yet could not shower as there was 4 others ahead of me. Food was nothing special and the offering was modest. Swiss should learn from Singapore Airlines Krisflyer lounge.

On the flight to Singapore on the B77W, I managed to get the ""throne"" seat. The seat was good, space was ample and inflight entertainment was acceptable. 

The food was a disappointment. I had pre ordered and confirmed a Hindu non vegetarian meal. But they uplifted an Asian Vegetarian option which I did not like at all.

Do not fall for the advertising or online videos, the service is very poor.  No attention to detail, no communication and swiss air dump you as quickly as possible, literally dumped us in a stairwell in the airport with no way out in a secure area and drove off. By far the world's worst first class service.  Do all that you can to find a better airline because this one is horrible. Not a word from management either. Not so much as a phone call to me with an explanation or apology. They took my money with no problem. Left us all horrified and fearful for our safety.  This is not the airline for me and I cannot recommend it to anyone. The fact that they leave you locked in a stairwell with no way out not knowing if security will arrive and shoot you on the spot speaks volumes. Much better air transport to choose from that treat you with a first class service that you pay dearly for..

We were able lay down in adjacent seats. Food was bland reminiscent of bland daycare food in the 80s. Stewards were okay. On our way back to LA, was another story.

The stewardesses were more friendly and good service. We love the Swiss chocolate they give throughout the flight! My only main issue is baggage. I went to the website and it said with regards to carry-on baggage they had to be a certain measurement as well as the personal item.

"Flight was ok, Airport should be avoided",Zurich,Los Angeles,International,"My flight left at 1pm from Zurich Airport. I arrived at the Check-in area around 10:30am into a VERY busy and packed area. Considering that the Swiss Air staff directs everybody to check-in using the electronic kiosks, the wait to drop luggage off was ridiculous. Just to let you know, I arrived at my international gate (outbound of EU) with almost no time to spare. 

Anyways, the security line wasn't actually too bad, and right after security you get to the duty free shopping area of the terminal. I am glad that my habit is to scout out my gate first, because I did not see any information anywhere that my international gate (even though it's the same terminal) is in a completely different building, requiring you to take a tram. After I finally located where my gate is supposed to be, you end up at the Swiss Border check, and that line was insane; it was easily a 30 minute wait to get through. Up to this point I've basically already spent 1.5 hours in the airport.

Once through the border, the tram was fairly quick and then a few levels up, you end up at the international gates. There are shops (duty free, coffee, food, etc) here, but I was nearing my boarding time so rushed to my gate. Turns out, the aircraft wasn't here yet and the staff was trying to find out where it is. The aircraft showed up soon, and they opened yet another checkpoint due to USA/TSA requirements, which is another line of roughly 350-400 people (passenger capacity of a 777-300ER). By the time I finally boarded the aircraft it was close to 12:50pm. We left about 45 minutes late.

Now, finally, the flight. The aircraft is VERY clean and I love the brown colored fabric/leather seats; it's a change from all the blue that everybody is using lately. I had the seat in the very back of the plane, last row on the side, which only has 2 seats instead of 3; there is a lot of space to store extra stuff for the window seat (I sat aisle). The flight overall was comfortable (12 hours) and the restroom and galley is right behind me.

What bothered me was that the entertainment system was not available to be used until we were at cruising altitude. So, from the point of me sitting down and settling in, a 45 minute delay, take off and reaching altitude, nobody could watch anything, because a Swiss Air commercial was running the entire team. Also, I must have missed the Safety briefing ...

During the flight the flight attendants are great! Very friendly and professional. Only caveat about this last row indented seat is, they forgot to ask us a few times for beverages and my seat mate didn't get his lunch even until we asked for it. Oh well, it happens.

Otherwise the rest of the flight was very uneventful and we landed at LAX with only a little bit of delay (15 minutes).

Hope this helps.

Safe travels.

Unbelievable Seat Assigment Policy,Chicago,Zurich,International,"As my daughter is getting ready for a language immersion program this summer, travelling for her first time internationally, on her own I made a change to her itinerary with United, as we used United to book her flights of which part are with Swiss Air.  Here's the kicker, initially to confirm seats, Swiss charges a fee, which was paid for all (4) Swiss legs of the trip.  The UA change eliminated one of the legs to reduce her number of stop overs.  United was AWESOME in helping us with this change.  when contacting Swiss to ask to refund the $50 for the assigned seat, the agent 1st said that that was out of policy and also refused to allow me to speak to a supervisor who was apparently not available.  REALLY?  I am stuck paying $50 for a seat on a flight which we are no longer using that is almost 3 months out?  As I have been booking flights for my entire family to spend time in Europe, the booking experience and this event with Swiss is by far the worst of the experiences I Have been encountering.

Then they promised that the luggage was going to come on a plane later that evening so we understood that we would fly to Geneva, wait at Geneva for our luggage. Liars. In Geneva were told that luggage wasn't going to arrive until the next day - by taxi sometime. We were given a form to complete. We had no clean underwear, nothing. Our ski pass had been paid for but we had no luggage. We were unable to go skiing. What a wasted day. We phoned Swiss air. Our luggage was still in Gatwick!!!!!!!

Extremely disappointing claim handling!,Zurich,Tokyo,International,"The best way to rate the quality of a company is to assess their handling of problems, as the way they deal with the customer in a situation like that can make all the difference between an excellent company and a business with poor customer service.

Delivering excellent service when things are going smoothly is not that difficult. What is probably even more important is how a service provider reacts when things go wrong.

In December 2018 I flew from ZRH to NRT. When arriving at my destination and opening my suitcase, I realised that it had been opened by Zurich Airport Authorities during a routine inspection. I found a notice inside, explaining that some flammable items had been removed for security reasons. Fair enough.
However, I was also missing a brand-new expense cashmere scarf, which I had brought along with me on my trip to Switzerland (still in its wrapping and with the tag on), but which I ended up not actually wearing due to the warm temperatures.

An e-mail inquiry with the Airport Authorities revealed that I needed to make a claim against SWISS, rather than the airport.

So I filed a claim through the SWISS Website in January, shortly after which I received an e-mail response from a consultant at their Customer Feedback Services, apologising for the incident, accepting the claim itself and the amount I had stated (estimated retail value of JPY 30,000, or approx. CHF 300), and asking me to provide details of my bank account, so that the funds could be transferred within the next 14 days.

That was about 3 months ago...

To this day, I'm still waiting for the money. On 25 February, upon further inquiry, I was told by the consultant that she was checking with their Accounting Department to find out the reason for the delay.

Since then the person has not responded to any of my further e-mail messages. And a second claim I entered through their Website (with reference to the original one) also prompted no response from the airline whatsover. That in my eyes, is extremely poor customer service!

I thought it might be easier to talk to Customer Services over the phone, to see what's going on. But I had to realise that SWISS does NOT maintain a phone number for Customer Services...
When talking to a representative, all I was told was to ""file another online claim, as Customer Service personnel were not reachable via phone"". When explaining that I had already done that, and that I had not received any response in almost 2 months despite repeated contact attempts, the answer was: ""I'm sorry, but all you can do is to file another claim with the online form.""

The most puzzling thing for me in this whole matter is that my original claim had been dealt with very efficiently, with a settlement offer being made almost immediately, and I remember thinking at the time how satisfactory it was to deal with an airline that was eager to keep their customers happy after an unfortunate event, and to offer a compensation without making a big fuss...

It almost seems as if the person I was corresponding with had acted without authorization in offering me that settlement, and now, upon realising or after being reprimanded, she simply decided to ignore my e-mails, hoping that I would eventually give up and go away. And knowing, of course, that I have absolutely no means of escalating this to anyone more senior at the airline.

If I had been told at the very beginning that the airline could not be held responsible for my loss, I would probably just have accepted it and filed a claim with my travel insurance instead.

But first accepting responsibility and offering compensation, and then simply not delivering on that promise, and instead just refusing to respond, that is not acceptable behaviour for any business, and less so for a reputable airline like SWISS, which prides itself on its customer service!
Moreover, if I now approach my insurance company for a claim, I will have to explain to them why I'm only doing so now, almost 4 months after the event, and then they will probably be rather unwilling to pay out, knowing that the airline had already promised to reimburse me...

Because I'm flying between Tokyo and Zurich a lot, and SWISS not only offers the fastest and most convenient route, but also at attractive rates, I will no doubt continue to use the airline also in future. But that doesn't hide the fact that I'm deeply, deeply disappointed in their handling of this matter, and I will be wary in the future.",December 2018,"April 11, 2019",2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0

Tightly squeezed cattle class,Singapore,Zurich,International,"Customer Service
The flight to Zurich, the staff were slightly more senior in age and because it's a red eye flight, they were probably more grim.

12 hour flight. Water was not served as often (during lights out) as other airlines.

Aircraft
The seats are MUCH smaller than what I have experienced on other airlines (Cathay, Emirates, Singapore Airlines). The seats were really petite. So much so that when I was seated with a tall german lady (she was in the center), she was practically sitting on my seat too. 
Legroom for me is fine but for that tall german lady who is hovering a good 1.78m to 1.8m, her knees were practically touching the back of the seat in front of her. 

Personally, I would not pay for the airline myself.",April 2019,"April 11, 2019",3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0
good enough service,Zurich,San Francisco,International,"We flew on a sunny Sunday from Zurich to SFO after a family vacation. The flight was long, but went by quickly, thanks in part to the good entertaining system on this aircraft, Boeing 770-300.

All in all a good enough experience.

Brilliant service in business class,London,Zurich,Europe,"I am a disabled passenger who recently flew Swiss to Athens via a brief stopover in Zurich. I cannot fault this airline! We felt welcome and valued. The food was divine. A cold platter of meat and cheese and potato salad plus dessert for the first leg and a hot meal of beef and polenta with fresh salad, dressing in a cute small bottle (but I found oil to be too bitter). Fresh warm bread on second leg (first leg the bread was not warmed). Lots of ice for our drinks and lovely champagne that I indulged in just for the sake of it, even though I am not a drinker. We sat on the first row which was spacious enough for a big person like me due to having a small armrest by window that your fatty bits can slide over and under. Only downside to row 1A-C is that the wall protrudes a bit in contrast with seats 1 D-F. As for legroom, there is plenty of knee room but you still have to keep your knees at 90 degrees angle which can be a bit tiring for people with large feet and week knees and ankles. Seat 1C has ample legroom as you can stretch your legs in the passage to the galley when there is no service cart but that is not normally available for PRMs. The middle seat is left free so I was able to use its armrest tray to sit my tray of food and my glasses (I am too fat to use my own tray. However, moderately fat people will be able to use the tray because it slides out far enough.) Talking of the seats, they are on the hard side which became an issue on the second (longer) flight but that was probable me, because I couldn't move to release the pressure. On arrival to Zurich, I had to wait for the other passengers to disembark and there was some confusion about the location of my wheelchair (Heathrow staffer had not explained she was putting the wheelchair all the way through to Athens) but the lady porter was reassuring and even dropped me off at the toilet. Zurich airport looks so pretty and it is a pity I didn't book a longer transit time in order to enjoy exploring it. Just for your information, a business flight with Swiss is just about ¬£40 more than an economy flight (depending on dates of course and demand) so for ¬£40 for two people, I'd say it is well worth it!

I had combined clothes and work things into a single bag to save space. My colleague had separated into 2 bags and was allowed to take both on board while I had the embarrassment of unpacking mine at the gate. On this flight , just after the trolley had past I needed the bathroom. Seeing that I couldn't pass to the rear because of the trolley and 2 attendants I moved through business class to use the bathroom at the front.

And then I had quite an argument - how many ski sets I can have per passenger. Per Air Canada - a ski bag can contain many sets of skis, as long as they fit into one bag - it is one piece of luggage. Not for Swiss - only one pair per passenger. Despite the fact that the first leg is on Air Canada and the luggage will be checked in all the way from  Vancouver to Zurich. I just hanged up them.  It all worked fine at the end but the flight arrived more then 1 hour late. Was not as accurate as Swiss watch. They should train their phone people better so they know IATA rules.

"Almost Perfect, Yet Flawed",San Francisco,Nice,International,"The flight was from SFO to Zurich.  In Zurich, I took a connecting flight to the final destination, Nice. Swiss planes reflect the country.  Everything is quite organized, clean, and professional. Yes, the flight crew smiles and says hello.....There is an overall sense, that they are your smiling Swiss hosts.

What is interesting is my return flight was on Lufthansa (the parent airline). This provides an easy point of comparison for you. 

Yes, the crew was excellent, professional, and quite kind (rather like visiting a small Swiss town).  In fact, the crew was so nice, I almost feel guilty mentioning any negatives (Gulp). 

I only had 2 complaints with my Swiss Air experience. My issues are going to be difficult for the Swiss to fix.  First the seats (even on Business Class) are not as comfortable as you get with Lufthansa. Now considering that the seats are your actual contact  to the plane, this happens to be a fairly big deal.  I do not understand why Lufthansa seats should be so much better than Swiss Air seats, but they are!  There is a real quality difference. Given a choice, now, I would rather fly Lufthansa.

Issue number 2 could be cultural.  The planes are trimmed out with pegboard.  You remember this stuff.  It was often put on garage walls and little metal pegs are attached to it in order to keep garage rakes and hammers handy. If I were the designer, I would have selected a more upscale looking finish.  OK, this sounds petty, but this pegboard is just about ‚Äòeverywhere‚Äô.  You will even see it around your seat.  The look, to me, is close to what you would get if the plane was trimmed out with plywood.  

I would grade the food served at  a ‚ÄúB‚Äù.  It was nicely served, pleasant, yet, and nothing special or memorable.  

If you fly planes for the film selection, you could find a better variety and more choices elsewhere.  For me, however, a guy with just a moderate interest in film while flying, the choices offered were quite acceptable (again, like the food, if not memorable). 

Overall, and until Swiss Air improves those seats, I would likely select another airline, given the choice.  That is a shame and I hate to admit it.  Those kind Swiss people have me feeling guilty for this review.  The overall experience was close to what you might have flying British Air......Pleasant enough, but somehow, something, is lacking...20 years ago, I would not have made that statement.  

Perhaps the score is somewhat lower because I was able to compare and contrast my experience with the Lufthansa return flight.  Normally, Lufthansa scores highest among European airlines.  Still, an airline like Austrian Air (owned by Lufthansa) seems to be trying even harder and will impress you with their dining options.

"Great seats, less great consideration",San Francisco,Rome,International,"What impressed me was that the coach seats are the most comfortable for that level that I can recall.

They recline a lot and though I am 6' 2"" there was room under the seat ahead to stretch my legs. I slept well and did not cramp. Problem came when at my destination my doctor told me to come back before my return flight though I had bought nonrefundable. After two calls a Swiss person said they MIGHT change my return IF I got a note from that doctor. I ended up getting my doctor to relent and put off my appointment till after the return flight. Almost all other airlines allow one to simply pay a fee to change the flight date.

Fair to Middling,Dubai,New York City,International,"Flew return from Dubai to JFK via Zurich in business with my family. 

The outbound journey was punctual, the on board entertainment mediocre and the seating layout just plain wired - do your research before selecting a seat. Some of the business class seats are like thrones with armrest consoles either side, whilst others leave you slightly exposed on the aisles and I would imagine by the looks of them that you‚Äôd be getting a feeling of being hard done by for the same price. 

The outbound journey had the most uncomfortable seats I‚Äôve had in business and they urgently needed an over haul. They also don‚Äôt go quite flat which for me (183cm) is ok, but not so comfortable for others. 

Return journey was a different story, same aircraft and layout but the seats were much better and far more comfortable. 

Lounge in Zurich is functional without being amazing, which is a reflection on Swiss as a whole. They were half the price (around US$ 10,000 for 2 adults 1 child) I‚Äôd have to pay on Emirates or Etihad, with more that half the value.

I then rebooked with Qatar for the same day and as I requested cancellation and refund I was told the flight was missed and I cannot do that YET I WAS REFUSED TO BOARD .

Not Good To Trust Swiss Airlines.,New Delhi,Toronto,International,"The Airlines uses CheapoAir as there agents. They charge for every change and every delay.

Vol comfortable et personnel attentif,Sao Paulo,Bordeaux,International,"When we travel to Asia, we fly Economy because we can easily have a stopover night in Dubai then continue our way with flights no longer than 5 to 7 hours maximum. But to go to South America, it‚Äôs not the same. And the long leg of the journey  is generally a night flight. And we can‚Äôt sleep sitting... So my husband and I made some research on internet and found a great deal with SwissAir. Of course it was not a direct flight (Bordeaux-Z√ºrich-Sao Paulo-Buenos Aires) but it was a small price to pay to be able to afford Business Class. The flight on the way out was with their partner Lufthansa. And the short flight from Brasil to Argentina was with Latham.
Anyway... We were very pleased with the flight. Comfortable and spacious ‚Äúpod‚Äù with flat bed for the night. Good food. The wine selection is not as extensive as on other lines but it was enough. Same for the choose of movies but as it was mostly a night flight it didn‚Äôt really matter.
Very attentive staff and thus with everybody. For ex, we had a Business flight recently with AirFrance and we noticed than you didn‚Äôt get the same level of attention if you were wearing a suit or a more casual outfit...

Nice for International Flying,Los Angeles,Rome,International,"I've been flying directly to the UK for nearly 30 years on Virgin Atlantic; this was our first experience flying to a different European nation on a different airline - so my comments about Swiss come from that background.

Mostly, the two airlines' economy class service are comparable. The one place where Swiss exceeds VA is in the legroom provided for economy flyers - it was definitely more comfortable for my husband and me.

Overall, the flight was very easy (considering the fact that flying overseas in economy is no picnic). Fewer meal choices on Swiss, but that's not a biggie - food and beverage were adequate and the flight staff worked hard to make people comfortable. Fewer amenities in economy as well, but we were prepared for that. 

Entertainment options were not as wide as on Virgin either, but the selection included some very recent hit movies and TV shows, and we understand that the airlines are all moving toward allowing travelers to use their own devices, so that's probably moot. The flight to Zurich did not have wireless internet, the flight back did. There is a USB port on the entertainment screen that allowed my husband to charge his phone; it did not work for my tablet. I don't know if that was a power issue or if I just had a faulty connection.

Safe flight but in a tired/outdated plane,Canton of Geneva,New York City,International,"Firstly the positives. There is no doubt one feels in safe hands with Swiss Air. The crew too are professional, courteous and pleasant. I also appreciated the choice to take hand luggage only at a slightly cheaper price. And indeed we have flown routes with Swiss which have proven very pleasant.

Our recent trip to New York, however, did not come up to scratch. The Airbus A330 looked tired and badly in need of a good refurbishment (or simply put into retirement); the screens are miniscule by most reputable airlines' standards and the range of films and TV shows leaves much to be desired; while the food was pleasant enough, there are signs of budget cuts - witness a bit of iceberg lettuce with a few strands of shredded carrot as the salad entr√©e, and the tasteless sliver of packeted cheese. While I can't be 100% certain, it also felt as if the maximum number of seats had been squeezed in thus making it feel cramped on all sides.

We were then instructed to rent a stroller, but there was no attendant on duty and we were reluctant to place a baby into a stroller, from a safety issue!! We then spent the next couple of hours in the airport terminus holding baby in our arms. When we arrived at the departure gate the check in attendant had placed all four adults in different seating rows. The plane was not full. We then requested we try and seat together and although this was achieved, it caused complete chaos to passengers because the seat numbers had been altered.

My luggage was a small samsonite much smaller than the permissible cabin luggage. Both times I boarded and could clearly see that the overhead bins had more than enough room for hand luggage. My hand luggage had medication which I was told to take out and I had nowhere to put it but to walk with my boxes of medication in my hands. Really ridiculous.  I had to stuff my boxes of medication in the seat pocket in front of me on the flight. Seems both times that they accommodated passengers from another flight who missed their flights. The staff at Kennedy need to be trained on how to handle Swiss passengers in a courteous and friendlier manner. The food on that segment is disgusting and tasteless.

The out bound flight went without a hitch with just a 50 minute connecting flight. Swiss Air staff were excellent. 
The return flight was very much the same, with a faultless service with both flights back to London Heathrow. 
Having had a clear run through passport control we walked into the baggage reclaim hall and as we approach the conveyor belt, our cases were the first up. Brilliant. 
However, we also had two ski bags to collect from the oversize baggage belt and that‚Äôs where our problem started. In short they were still in Geneva, but it took 2hours to reach that conclusion as the staff did not check properly to start with. When we finally spoke to someone that checked properly we were soon on our way with all the paperwork in hand and a promise they would deliver them to my home as soon as they got them back in the UK. To be fair they kept me fully updated with progress and both ski bags were delivered to my home within 48 hours all intact. Problem solved.",February 2019,"March 12, 2019",4.0,,,,,,,,

Cramped,San Francisco,Zurich,International,"Airfare:  The airfare was verrrry reasonable, which probably explains why the flight was sold out and space was at a premium.

Seat/Comfort:  I was seated in the middle of the plane in between two men and felt almost as if I had to hold my breath for the entire flight.  I was able to choose a seat in the first row of economy which was behind a ""wall"" and not behind another row of seats so I had a decent amount of legroom, but the seat itself was verrrrrry narrow.  I had read reviews before my trip (about the lack of space) and unfortunately, I experienced the same discomfort that many reviewers describe.  I am tall, but very thin and this seat was outrageously narrow for an international flight.  I won't be taking Swiss Air again.

Service:  I wasn't really impressed with the level of service.  I wasn't offered any wine or a cocktail during beverage service and when I asked for one, the flight attendant begrudgingly gave me one.  Also, it seemed as if they ran out of dinner choices because when an attendant came by she said my only choice was pasta.  I asked if they had anything else and she said she would check.  I ended up getting some beef, but only after waiting for about 20 minutes and finally asking what the final verdict was about my options.

Assigned the most uncomfortable seat and row I've ever had,Zurich,New York City,International,"A few issues:  (1) headphone jacks are 2 prong which is idiosyncratic so we can't use our own headphones, big issue for my audiophile kid and (2) while the staff is nice, and food is fine, I'm rethinking Swiss Air (even though I usually seek out non-American airlines for a better experience) after my young teen son and I were randomly assigned a row toward the back where (a) there were 3 seats in our row and 4 in the row ahead of us, so the seatback TVs were half a seat away and the tray came out of the seat and (b) my seat was so narrow, that it was the most uncomfortable seat I've ever sat in (I checked the seat on the other side of the aisle and it was fine, my son's was slightly better than mine).  My son moved half the plane away for a better middle seat, and I sat in his seat next to a large man who spilled over into my seat.  Swiss Air was pleasant about it and I finally moved into an empty middle seat in the next row, but it was uncomfortably tight for an 8 hour flight and really not a good experience or value.  If Swiss Air thinks a plane like that is appropriate, with 2-prong headphones, I am seriously going to think twice before going with Swiss Air again.

They care about you,Larnaca,Curitiba,International,"This is one the the finest airline I have the pleasure to fly. Let me tell you why: When I was going back to Brazil, after a conference meeting in Cyprus, I had to fly 4 legs (Larnaca to Munich, Munich to Zurich, Zurich to Guarulhos, and Guarulhos to Curitiba).

Although I had 1 to 2 hours between the first two legs, the Yellow Vest strikes in France caused a cascade effects in the Europe airports that affected flights in Germany. Therefore my flight from Munich to Zurich was delayed. I was simply considering I would miss my flight to Brazil and would be held in Zurich until the next day.

Surprisingly, during the second leg fly, the flight attendant asked for those who were in the next flight because Swissair would transport us directly to the aircraft in the soil. When we arrived in Zurich, they had a van that took us to a specific immigration room where our passports were checked, along with our luggage, and drove us to our aircraft, which was waiting for us.

Thank you for the lady that drove the van and care us all the way from aircraft to aircraft. Thank you Swissair for handling timely all the flights.

I am a normal size person and haven't ever had a problem with economy seatings. Swiss simply wants to make more money seating too many people, and does it at your expense. Simple.

It was offensive, WRONG (the bag was regular: so much so that I came back on the return flight with SWISS using the same pieces of luggage and no one had anything to say about it), uncivilized.

Consistently Good,Canton of Geneva,London,Europe,"I am a regular traveler on Swiss, usually from Geneva to London Heathrow or occasionally to London City, normally at least once a month averaging out at 15 or so return flights per year.

I always fly Swiss as I cannot stand Easy Jet or Gatwick Airport. I do have a Swiss Frequent Flier card which entitles me access to their Business Class lounges at the airport run by Swiss at Geneva and Lufthansa at Heathrow, which makes life much more pleasant.

As I do not actually travel Business Class the Swiss Flight Attendants are unaware of my Frequent Flyer status, but their treatment of their ""ordinary"" passengers is second to none, their in-flight service while restricted to a glass of water or a bottle of water and a cheese sandwich if you have checked in baggage, it is still exemplary, mustn't forget the complimentary small bar of Swiss Chocolate. In line with most short haul airline service these days, you can of course buy food and drink on board.

At ""advanced"" prices comparable with Easy Jet and next week's prices usually below Easy Jet's, plus the fact that they actually fly to London Airports and not those based in the Home Counties that somehow feel the need to add London to their name, I wonder when we will see Easy Jet flying to London Manchester.",February 2019,"February 27, 2019",4.0,3.0,3.0,,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0

Practically two different airlines: On European routes Swiss is ridiculously spartan in service, obviously trying to align itself to its mother company Lufthansa who focuses on less demanding or sophisticated public. Cabin crew are often Germans who apparently can not always cope with a cosmopolitan multilingual and refined clientele.
On long haul flights the image is fairly different. Swiss multilingual cabin crews outnumber the not so agile Germans and cater for your needs. Food quality is good so is the entertainment. Swiss lounge in JFK is excellent",January 2019,"February 27, 2019",4.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0

Multiple changes that greatly affected our trip. Really poor service.,London,Zurich,Europe,"Booked for LHR-ZRH a week before flight, travelling from Manchester via train as it was substantially cheaper. Flight got cancelled for unknown reasons and got auto-rebooked onto a Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt which then transferred to Z√ºrich, which added ~4 hours to our travel time. 

Called to attempt to shift to a Manchester-Z√ºrich flight which would get us in at the same time as originally planned. First person we called (using the UK number) asked for us to call back in fifteen minutes because her shift was about to finish and didn‚Äôt want to go over her scheduled shift time. I wish I was joking. Hung up on us. 

Redialled using the Australian number (seriously) and actually got to have a conversation. Asked to change to the Manchester flight (keeping in mind, at all times saying we‚Äôre happy to pay the difference in fare). Told it was impossible and that we could only be on the London-Frankfurt-Z√ºrich option. Asked if there were any flights that got us in earlier (was told there wasn‚Äôt). Increase in travel time affected things previously booked, meaning any cost benefit associated with flying out of LHR was wiped. 

Arrive at LHR on the day, check in attendant mentioned there was a direct flight to Z√ºrich available without extra cost, but would fly out fifteen minutes later. Helped cancel our flight and rebook, got us exit row seats and paid for our lunch for the inconvenience. If I remembered her name I‚Äôd give her a shoutout, because she was the gleaming diamond in the turd that was our experience with Swiss. Flew out the 25th approx 13:45, she was working the middle counter (not bag drop - inquiries/checkin assistance). Had the aura of someone who had been at the company for a while and was sick of putting out other people‚Äôs fires.

Problem with boarding due to incompetent staff (blamed their internal rule),London,Penang,International,"Heathrow via Zurich and Singapore then Silk Air to Penang.
Swiss Air Staff said they coul;d not put me on flight as I didn't have a return ticket from Penang within 90 days. Normal for me as I am fully aware UK passport holders only get 90 days visa for Malaysia so I hop moff to Sinapore or Thailand within the 90 days and then fly back to UK from Malaysia within my next 90 days allowed stay.
Knowing Singapore to Penang was with Swiss air I told them to book the liggage through to Penang and give me  boarding passes to Singapore knowing Silk Air would not have a problem giving me a boarding pass tpo Penang which turned out to be the case. Airlines should be aware that experienced travellers know and don't break the rules.
As for the flights unaventful, food  ot very good, below standard for even economy. Onboard staff friendly. only 23kg luggage allowance stingy. Singapore Airlines allow more and give better food.

Very nice airline,Canton of Geneva,Vienna,Europe,"I have travelled several Swiss flights within Europe as well as cross-continental.

They surely have the best looking, and feeling seat fabric (!!) in the economy sections compared to other airlines.

Always presented with a Swiss chocolate and in the long haul ones, with a La Gruy√®re stick.

A few years ago, when my boy was only 1 and a few months and must have been feeling some sort of discomfort just before landing, the head stewardess took him and kept on trying to distract him from cockpit to the back of the plane...and it worked so well for him.

While we (probably we all) have been looked at or even instructed at to keep our too-little ones silent.

It is really not so much the food and the seats - but always a feeling of calmness and relaxing that is important for me in a flight. And their in flight stewards are one of the best in these terms. Which is why I think that Swiss Hospitality is not an over-rated thing.

It must be very nice in Business and First Class I reckon!

We have the Swiss App on our mobile phone and checked in with Swiss 23 hours before our flight and noted we'd been moved up to row 3 in premium class. A couple of hours before boarding, we received an update on our App stating we'd been moved back to row 9? As we boarded the plane, I noted that Row 9 was just outside of the premium seats which were entirely empty except for 1 person. I showed the stewardess our boarding passes printed earlier which clearly showed our seats on row 3 and also our mobile app now showing seats on row 9. She had no explanation and pulled out a customer chart showing our seats as row 9. I didn't make a big deal out of it but pointed to all of the empty rows ahead and also pulled out my Swiss receipts showing our seats were paid for months before. She apologized and said there wasn't anything she could do and they couldn't allow us to move ahead to the seats we purchased. She then shut the curtain and the entire 8 rows in front were empty except for one customer. We fly often internationally and have never experienced anything like this before.

Hopeless ground staff/'tell it to someone who cares' attitude of complaints staff,Hamburg,Zurich,Europe,"I booked a ZH/Hamburg/ZH flight. Subsequently, my plans changed and I first flew to Helsinki with another airline before returning to spend a few days in Hamburg. When I arrived at Hamburg airport to return to Zurich, I was informed by check-in staff that my ticket had been cancelled as I did not take the outbound flight. However, helpfully the person told me I could pay an amendment fee at the Swiss sales desk to have my ticket reinstated and gave me the code number to pass to the staff at that desk.

Unfortunately, despite handing over the code to the sales desk staff, the junior staff member did not use it but spent 25 minutes on the phone, trying to get instructions on what he should do. Eventually, he received confirmation that my ticket could be amended (using the code I gave him at the outset) but advised that check-in for my flight had now closed. The upshot was that I had to buy an exorbitantly expensive one way ticket with Eurowings and arrived back in Zurich 2 hours late.

Despite multiple communications with Swiss' complaints department, I have received neither an apology nor proper recompense. This despite the fact that the issue was due to the incompetence of Swiss staff at their sales desk and the fact that my wife and I have flown Melbourne/ZH business class return on multiple occasions over the years.",July 2018,"February 17, 2019",1.0,,,,,,,1.0,

Best of all was the delicious Swiss chocolate they passed out toward the end of the flight.

Something to consider: The ticket prices for Swiss were generally more expensive than the other European airlines. But if you pay extra for more legroom anyway, it may be worth paying the extra ticket price, because this comes standard.

A word of advice: Swiss will not allow online ticket purchases within 24 hours prior to departure. If you find a great last minute deal, go to Lufthansa to purchase the ticket.

I highly recommend Swiss and will fly this airline again.",February 2019,"February 17, 2019",5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
"Ok, but probably wouldn‚Äôt fly with again long haul",Tokyo,Manchester,International,"We flew with Swiss Tokyo to Manchester, changing in Zurich.
The long haul plane was very dated - I know the A340s are being gradually replaced but looked like it could have done with a good refurbishment. Entertainment systems (important, in my opinion, when you‚Äôre on the plane for over 12 hours!) were very dated, screens small and operated by a remote in your seat arms. Mine crashed 5+ times during the flight so I gave up using it. Notified the attendant and she just shrugged - a bit annoying, not sure if all seats on the plane were full.

Disappointing Flight,Zurich,Tokyo,International,"I have been flying Swiss for many years. I used to be a Frequent Flyer, at one point with gold status. It always felt good to get on a Swiss flight anywhere in the world and feel like I was almost home.
Recently, I flew to Japan in an old airplane. Since not many passengers fly to Japan in January, I assume that an especially small and old airplane was deployed. 
The seats were uncomfortable, very narrow and not fully flat when in the sleeping position. The food was not good at all. The restrooms were old and stained (not unclean, but stained from old age) and very tight. The service was ok, but twice the menu we picked was no longer available. I know, I know, I am no longer a Frequent Flyer. I know, this time, I used miles to pay for the flight. And this seems to have made me a Passenger Second if not Third Class. Although ... quite frankly, if I have accumulated enough miles to fly to Japan in Business Class, this should make me a good customer, right?
I was very disappointed. I don't fly as frequently as I used to, but is this the new Swiss standard? The last flight I took to Los Angeles was a lot more comfortable.
The movies, BTW, were old, and the sound was terrible. The remote control didn't always work. In all, it was not a good experience. I will think again before booking my next flight to Japan with Swiss.",January 2019,"February 16, 2019",3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0

Then on the day of travel and only at the gate I was informed that there is no upgrade. Thats after the staff at the NY JFK lounge confirmed to me verbally that the upgrade was ready at the gate! No apology or explanation, worse they make you feel like you did something wrong ... after my protest they told me that I was outbid!

This is the WORST airlines we've ever taken.
1. The team had no patience, was obnoxious to people on board and wasn't very accommodating when (2) happened.
2. It was a long flight (8hours) and the screen did NOT work at all ! Not even for a second!
3. NO SPACE AT ALL for your legs (I'm 178cm) 
4. They don't tell you the WIFI is not free when you book the flight, you'll know once you've boarded 
5. The voucher they gave us to apologise about the delay was 50CHF and did not work when we tried to use it ! (NB: you can't use it for additional luggage so we tried to use it for the WIFI on board, did not work either!)
6. I am one of these people who don't dare bending their seat so I don't bother the person sitting behind me. The guy in front of me was definitely not one of these people and bend his seat (which is normal! good for him for not feeling bad every time he moves!), I swear I couldn't even open my tray or fit my laptop on my thighs or anything.

Even though the plane was late in departing, it more than made up the time, arriving only 20 minutes behind schedule.   Very good information provided by the crew in terms of our schedule, and information for people who were transiting MIA for other flights.  Complete transparency.  Now, for the real difficulty that Swiss Air Lines handled in an exemplary fashion -  our baggage did not arrive with us in Miami.

Poor service for international customers,Zurich,Kristiansund,Europe,"Having flown with Swiss on mammy occasions, I can say that the service has been dropping down over the years to nothing special. 

On a seperate note, this review is actually motivated by my latest booking experience with them. I decided to book directly through the airline instead of a third party site like Expedia. I thought this would make service easier but when I needed to change my booking within 24hrs of making it, I encountered some issues.

Firstly the change in fare they proposed for the ticket was more than the price of an entirely new ticket that I could purchase at that moment on their own website. Somehow this fare class is unattainable for ticket ""changes"". I opted instead to cancel the booking and make a new booking since this was about 700 chf less. 

Swiss will refund a ticket but withhold a service charge of roughly 30 chf. That's annoying but to make matters worse, they issued the refund as a seperate transaction instead of canceling the original and charging the service fee on the side. For anyone paying with a foreign credit card, this means a roughly 6 percent loss (3% on both sides) on the entire ticket price, on top of the service charge.

So after all that, now I am struggling to get a receipt for the refund. The only department that can issue the receipt has no phone number and the general customer service is powerless to assist. One week has passed since sending an email request and almost two weeks since the original transaction and still unresolved.

Can‚Äôt give zero stars.,Canton of Geneva,Dublin,Europe,I believed that booking with Swiss would ensure a fast professional service but in years of flying I have never experienced such chaos such as check in at Geneva Airport.

The FAs are very courteous and professional but the food choices, in flight entertainment and non-alocholic drinks are definitely sub-par compared not to the ME3 and Asian carriers but to other European carriers like Turkish Airlines.

I've created a profile on the website and made my meal and seat preferences known to the airline, but, to no avail. As a Muslim I've found their description of Halal meals to be rather insulting defining it as ""doesn't contain pork"", I was however, offered food prepared with Alcohol!!!

I was also surprised that (other than a sandwich, more later) any food or drink was payable (for example, not the case on KLM). Swiss appear to have combined flag carrier prices with low cost airline service quality and ancillary charges - hardly a winning formula.
As regards the free sandwich, I was so astonished that after one bite I took a photo. The ‚Äúbread‚Äù was dry, very stale, with a tiny smear of some unidentifiable pale tasteless paste.

Seat arrangement at Swiss is very disappointing!,Zurich,Tokyo,International,"I recently booked a flight to Japan and realized that outbound flights are operated by Swiss (otherwise Nippon Airways). Since we are traveling as a family, 2 adults, 2 children aged 10 and 7 years old, I wanted to book seats for a long-hauled flight (Zurich - Tokyo) however I was able to do so only against payment. I called support service and they told me the same. They also confirmed that Swiss does not have any policy where minors must be accompanied by an adult (parent). 
So, if I do not pay extra 140‚Ç¨ to book seats it might happen that my 7 and 10 year old would sit by themselves on a long hauled flight for 12 hours with their parents away from them!!! This is not a problem if the flight is short(er) however for an overseas flight this is unacceptable. 

As Swiss is considered as one of the best airlines (No. 12 as per Skytrax) this is definitely a big and unwelcome surprise. Even Ryanair (ranked 64 at Skytrax!!!) which is considered as a low cost airline has a policy that a minor must sit next to a parent. I really do not understand how an airline like Swiss would allow that!

How a passenger sitting next to a five or six or 7 year old would feel when the child would need help with food or would be cranky and tired, possibly crying? How would parents feel if they would need constantly be going to kids seat or kids not wanting to stay at the seat without parents? I believe it is even more challenging for stewardesses/ flight crew with arrangement like that.

For return flight from Tokyo we had no issues of booking seats on the airplane free of charge (operated by Nippon&Eurowings). Actually this is the first case within all our travels (we are traveling overseas at least once per year) that we encountered needed payment for booking seats for the overhauled flight. If we were only adults or my children would be aged 15 and over this would not be an issue however as they are still minors it is very hard for me as a mother/ parent to accept that they would be surrounded by strangers for 12 hours and sitting by themselves. 
We are not even seeking to have all 4 seats together, 2 by 2 seats are completely fine- so if I do not pay, my kids might sit by themselves (seating based on the availability 24 hours before the flight). 
This is the first and the very last flight that I'm booking/ flying with Swiss! VERY unpleasant experience and very dissapointing!

B777 / 300 Business seating less space,Zurich,Bangkok,International,"For a long time I fly long-distance flights in the business class. This year I chose Swiss for the first time from Zurich to Bangkok (LX180). 
At Zurich Airport, I was served very friendly; quick check-in, pleasant stay in the business lounge, uncomplicated and fast boarding on a full plane.

Compare with other airlines, the seats on Swiss Business Class are narrow and have few storage space. My seat (8D) had little storage compartment. There was only a tiny drawer, just fine for a glasses case. The handbag and shoes had to be stowed at the foot. To compare: the Boeing 777-300 Thai Airway, according to ""SeatGuru"", 34 flat bed seats are listed, but 62 flat bed seats are listed on the same machine on Swiss. I made my seat into lie flat mode to prepare for some sleep. It‚Äôs disappointing that no mattress pad was offered; only a pillow and a blanket. The pillow was acceptable but the blanket was not as luxurious as I‚Äôd expect on Swiss. 

A meet very nice and courteous flight staff. The food was good, but with the description on the menu, the chef is also 'up in the air'.
All things added up, I‚Äôd say my experience wish Swiss B777-300 Business class was positive.

Great flight spoiled by the hub-approach,Canton of Geneva,San Francisco,International,"Unfortunately, my great flight ZRH-SFO was spoiled by the experience from Geneva to Zurich. Is Swiss wants to promote its hub in Zurich, it should make more efforts to consider its passengers coming from other locations.

My bad experience started at check-in, where the person at the desk did not know was the Global Entry Programme was. She had to call her superior and the whole process lasted 25 minutes until I was cleared to get my ZRH-SFO boarding card.

Going to the lounge, I was directed to the senator lounge even thoug I had a first-class ticket from ZRH. After discussion, the staff let me in in the first class lounge in GVA. 

In the lounge, good service, but unfortunately they have taken away the Nespresso machine (cost-cutting measures ?) and there were no magazines (cost-cutting measures ?)

In Zurich, we taxied to a remote location on the tarmack, no on a bridge. There was no service to the lounge. I had to take the bus to terminal A, look for the first-class lounge (not easy to find from this side). I then asked to be trasnfered to terminal E, but there was a waiting time of 15 minutes. I was finally driven in an 8-seated bus to terminal E. Time between getting out of the plane from GVA to the lounge : 35 minutes, same time as flying from GVA to ZRH. Since they drive you anyway from terminal A to E, why do they not get you at the plane ? This is a terrible client experience‚Ä¶for this kind of price

On a good note, the flight from ZRH to SFO was on time, great service, friendly staff, great food, comfortable pyjamas, excellent beds (the mattresses and the duvet are really great).

Not meeting expectations,Zurich,Hong Kong,International,"Check in for this flight was rather straightforward and we were soon going through customs and security which was all rather brief as Zurich airport was rather desert late at night. Boarding was smooth and efficient and so far everything was going okay. Unfortunately things weren‚Äôt as impressive during the flight as I hoped them to be. As per usual the 777-300 was in a 3-4-3 formation. I did find in comparison to other airlines that Swiss leave a small gap between the window seat and the window seat which eliminates aisle space. This was a major pain for me in the aisle seat as it was nearly impossible not to be bumped by every person and cart that went past you. Unsurprisingly I prefer the window seat right up to the window as this means a wider aisle. The flight left on time and the seat belt sign was off quickly enough meaning the dinner service started rather quickly. The meals I must say we were one of the high points of Swiss airlines as food often has a terrible reputation in the sky. The lights were dimmed shortly after dinner as per usual which was when I started to browse the inflight entertainment in the hope of finding enough content to fill up the next 9 or so hours. What I did find was the most disappointing inflight entertainment selection I‚Äôve ever encountered. A very limited selection of tv,films and music meant I didn‚Äôt use the inflight entertainment full stop. Luckily I had hours of music and downloaded shows to fulfill my time. One good thing about Swiss was the amount of times the flight attendants came around with water during the flight to the point it seemed excessive but completely justified as one will usually find themselves drinking more than usual on a flight. Toward the end of the flight when it was around 1400 there was the second meal service. At 1400 BREAKFAST was the meal. I still can‚Äôt get my head around this, with this being the most illogical meal possible at this time. Anyway the breakfast tasted alright but certainly didn‚Äôt help adjusting time zones. Toilets are always the same in economy small and clean so nothing out of the ordinary about the toilets. Overall I had high expectations prior to the flight as I find their short haul flights in Europe very good. Unfortunately these expectations weren‚Äôt met meaning I‚Äôm not in a rush to fly them again. Although the price is cheap i will be looking elsewhere next time I‚Äôm flying long haul in and out of Europe.",January 2019,"January 17, 2019",4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0

We were disappointed in Swiss Air,Johannesburg,Zurich,International,"We have flown with Swiss Airlines before and sadly the second experience had been no better than the first.  The majority of the attendants came across superficially friendly - there were one or two who obviously did not mind helping and caring.  The rest seemed to be simply doing a job they had to do whether they liked or not.   This was also noticeable in the overall serving of food and beverages.  They were slow to start with the evening meal,  slow to move down the isles,  slow to offer second drinks/coffee,  slow to collect the dinner plates.  Not at all what we expected of the world wide impression of Swiss quality and efficiency.  One upside though, were the availability of soap, hand cream and spray in the toilets.  Not all airlines offer sprays.  The food were OK - not bad but not good either.   The choice of breakfast before we landed in Zurich, however, was a major let down:  we were served a COLD sandwich.  At the end of a 10 hour flight, a cold sandwich just does not go down well.   If the service and food were good, one could look past the aircraft being on the old side, with no USB port to charge a phone and old technology in-flight entertainment.

Several of the seats in economy were broken, ie. could not be pushed back, so that one was treated like an animal, i.e. front seat worked and yours did  not, so that you are trapped and find it hard to get out to go to the lavatory....AGAIN the stewardness did not seem surprised nor did  it appear that she/he would ever report the problem.

‚Äú‚ÄùThey screw you in the drive thru‚Äù (so to speak),Milan,Tel Aviv,International,"I was originally booked on Lufthansa from Milan to Tel Aviv. When I realized they were flying the A321, I changed my flight to Swiss Air (almost 1,000 change fee for 3 tickets( because it would be a 77W going and  a A330 on the return. Less than three weeks before my trip, I receive an email stating my seats were changed. Including my privacy seat, which I paid nearly 100 euro for 
Well, hahahaha on me, they changed the whole damn plane to, you quessed it, an A321. Why would any airline use this bucket for more than an hour or two flight? 
A330- Lie flat seats, AC power, Wifi, personal tv screen. 20.5 width seat. A321, 17‚Äù seat, 4‚Äù recline.
It‚Äôs extremely unfair to the customer when they think they‚Äôre getting A330 perks and end up getting the, we‚Äôre going to fly it until it breaks bucket. They get your money and then they, we‚Äôll, I‚Äôll say screw you to remain somewhat respectful. I was told by them they have a right to change and I agreed when I bought the ticket. However. Looking at their website it shows that plane being used for Europe and the three newer planes beyond. However, they‚Äôre sneaky, when I looked at the planes specs they have deeper in their website, there, it states they use the bucket for Europe. Near East and Africa. Although no where at the sales level does it say that. Naturally. One would think, you change the plane, not all of the goodies as well. On a long distance flight, this plane is a throwback to the 70‚Äôs without the ashtray. If you like airplane food, it‚Äôs included, if you have time. You might get a seat in the lounge. Me personally, the seat is everything, especially after running from Lufthansa because I couldn‚Äôt bear the thought of a nearly five hour flight in basically coach. In my opinion, they have no respect for their customers or the expense they go through to travel. 
Needless to say, I won‚Äôt ever book a flight with this terrible airline again. Originally when this flight was booked, someone at Swiss inadvertently deleted my itinerary and they blamed it on Expedia. It literally took 6 hours on the phone between the two companies to correct and reissue.
It‚Äôs been a circus act since minute one. If you decide to fly with SWISS, I wish you well.",January 2019,"January 14, 2019",2.0,,,,,,,,

Compensation of delayed flight,New Delhi,Amsterdam,International,"On 19th december 2018 We flew  from Delhi to Amsterdam via Zurich with Swiss Air. In Delhi our flt was delayed due to some technical reason as told by the crew. Because of the delay we missed our connection to Amsterdam from Zurich. We were rebooked on the next flight. We arrived in Amsterdam at 1440 hrs instead of 0910 hrs.  Our delay was more than 5 hrs. As per the regulation number  261/2004 we are entitle for the compensation, so we submitted our request. Surprised en  sorry to say  that the Customer Feedback Services of  Swiss Air says that the delay in Delhi was  due to external operational reasons to the airline and these circumstances are considered extraordinary. Which is completely not correct. As per the regulation 261/2004 the extraordinary circumstances are :  bad weather conditions, air traffic control strikes and acts of terrorism. There were  no such things happened that time. All the other flights were left in time from Delhi. 
This kind of response was never expected from such a reputated airlines. How can the airline make such excuses on the other hands they guarantee for complete satisfaction for the customer. I don‚Äôt think we will fly again with Swiss Air.",December 2018,"January 13, 2019",1.0,,,,,,,,
Horrible experience,Miami,Paris,International,"I just want to say that my flight experience with you guys was horrible. First, when we got to the airport we explained that a family emergency occurred and that two of the passengers were going to be flying at a later date. We ask if we could take the coming back flight and they said it was ok. Next, the airplane we took to go to Paris, had no air conditioning and it was very uncomfortable situation to be in for 8 hours. Then, when we got to the airport in Paris, they let me know that my pregnant wife and mother's ticket was cancelled without any notice. I never received any emails or call to inform me about the changes made. You guys wanted to charge me 4500 more dollars to buy tickets to a plane that we already purchased. I had to buy ticket from another airline and miss the opportunity to spend New year's together as a family. I couldn't buy any more tickets because we didn't have sufficient money and we were traveling with our 5 year old son. My wife and mother in law had to take a connecting flight to Turkey and stay in a hotel in the airport to spend New year's to then be able to flight to Miami. Also I live 3 hours away from Miami and we had to make an extra trip to picked them up. On the second flight we were all worried and couldn't feel comfortable with having our family members traveling to another country and missing the opportunity to spend New Year's together as a family.

no compensation for major flight delays and problems,Zurich,New York City,International,"Last year I flew with Swiss from Zurich to New York in March and in August. I have never written a review of an airline before, but I was so disappointed with the lack of compensation from the airline that I am now motivated to write something.

In March, the flight had an initial delay of about 4 hours. After taking off, there was a warning message related to one of the engines, so we were not allowed to fly over the Atlantic Ocean. In order to burn the fuel before re-landing in Z√ºrich, we flew in circles for 5.5 hours. This was extremely uncomfortable because the pilot would accelerate the plane and then slow down and then accelerate again, in order to burn the fuel faster. All of the passengers were very uncomfortable. After sleeping for a couple of hours in Z√ºrich, I was able to take a different Swiss flight. I arrived in New York the next day about 18 hours later than my originally scheduled landing. This flight even made the news. TripAdvisor doesn't let me post a link, but one article in the NZZ is ""Swiss-Maschine nach f√ºnfst√ºndiger Zwangspause in der Luft gelandet.""

In August, I waited for 5 hours for my flight to take off while Swiss investigated a mysterious green fluid in the cargo. It turned out to be a ""cosmetic item"" that was not dangerous at all.

Swiss has offered no compensation for either of these trips, despite the major inconveniences just 5 months apart. I will certainly look to another airline next time I travel.",March 2018,"January 10, 2019",1.0,,,,,,,,
Expedia - scammers and scammers,,,,"Good Day
Never fly Swiss Air or Work with Expedia.com.I enjoyed a great vacation to morocco only to end it completely stressed out. I booked my flights via Expedia, an online travel agent via the Sky Scanner website. My return flights were Marrakesh ‚Äì Geneva ‚Äì Zurich ‚Äì Beijing. As I was going to be in transit and had no intention to leave the transit area, I saw no problem. On arriving at the airport to depart, I was told I could not take this flight. The explanation was that there is a rule stating that one cannot transit in two Schengen areas for more than 24 hours. I was less than 24 hours but it was on two different days. This was unknown to me and there was nothing told to me via Expedia or Swiss air. I had been in contact directly to Swiss air with regards to other aspects of my flight, so there should have noticed this before. The staff at the airport gave me this reason and said they can‚Äôt help and were quiet rude about it. Directly telling me its my own issue and walked away. I asked for help at the Swiss air office to call the customer care and they refused to allow me to do so, again saying it‚Äôs my own issue as I did not buy it from them directly. As I see it, they set the route and times of the flight and have an obligation towards customers even if I did not buy it directly from them. On contacting Espedia, the agent said they can‚Äôt assist as they get the tickets directly from Swiss air and they set the routes. At the end of that day, I was forced to buy a new ticket from Swiss air at 700 USD.  Both Airline and travel agent denied accountability for not having any disclaimers and say I need to know my travel laws. To me, this is an easy way to get out. 
The next day, after spending close to 100 USD on calls and sleeping on a friends couch, I went back to depart. I was the first to arrive and first in line but the last to board. Once again the rude Swiss staff had issues about my flight. This time I bought the ticket directly from them and only had 2 hour stop in Munich. They had no idea if I could take that flight now and made me wait 2 hours. What was worse was that management was called down to help me but never did. The lady issuing tickets had to go up after half an hour of waiting to state my case. After another 45 minutes of no one telling me anything, I decided to go up and speak to management who brushed me of stating I should have patience. At 12.28, 2 minutes before boarding can close, they said: ok go in. This was without even an apology. On the flight they mixed my meals and all together was the worst flight and experience ever.

In London they let us sit in plane for more than 2 hours before take of - technical problems with the baggage computer system.
I had no hand luggage and was stranded in cold New York with only light sports wear on, that is very comfortable for traveling.
The customer service desk told me I can shop what I want because luggage will arrive in 2 days.
I did it trust them and wrote an email to Swiss customer service and asked for the amount I can get clothes, underwear etc. - no response at all. Finally I went to a discounter and bought the minimum necessities items, all on sale and for a total of $1500,-. 
When I sent the original receipts in, they offered me less than $400,-. I asked to get in touch with the supervisor and received an email with less then $800,- confirmed.
The Swiss employees wrote me, they will cut amount in half because I can wear goods more than one time!!!!!!!
I‚Äôm notinterested in this items at all and will with pleasure return them to Swiss when they cover the full amount of my expenses. 
I have not heard back from them since, nearly a month ago!

I have not only paid a premium price for a first class ticket, I also had to suffer a financial loss of $700,- cause by Swiss for not delivering my luggage and am stuck with cheap clothes I will never use again.

Swiss Air performed a systematic rip-off that has a patern with its customers.

The long haul flight from Zurich to HKG (and back) was not comfortable as the seats are very small and space is limited. The level of arm rest is too low for anyone to feel comfortable. 

However, when we were back from Zurich to London City, the flight was much more comfortable as the seats arrangement are 2+ 3. This is much better than those 3+3 in SAS or any other airlines with the same cabin. Well done Swiss Air.

A major cock up,Zurich,London,Europe,"Having booked my flight well in advance, this is the second time now that I have found my flight delayed on the tarmac due to congested airspace. However, this is first time that the aircraft actually started, taxied around the airport before returning to its starting place.
We were then told that Swiss had decided to cancel the flight since it would not be able to make it back out of London City inside of the airport curfew.
We were then unloaded and left to work out for ourselves what we had to do. Absolutely no one was there to tell where to go nor what to do. Thus, my wife, son and myself made our way to baggage reclaim and then to an information desk which told us where we needed to go. My sister-in-law on the other hand went a transfer desk where she had to wait some 2 hours before being booked on what turned out to be a nonexistent flight which she was then later transferred to a scheduled flight. This meant she only just made it for a musical we‚Äôd booked.

Absolutely nightmare,Berlin,Tel Aviv,International,"I made a booking via Expedia 10 months in advance choosing Swiss for past experience and for offering the a330 aircraft as a carrier. 
While booking I made a mistake and chose Am instead Pm , price was similar, and the line in Expedia were close . 
Upon check in, I discovered the mistake and contacted Swiss customer service, 
They told me to talk to Expedia, and I did 
Expedia said that Swiss don‚Äôt allow the change unless I will pay 600$ for new ticket. 
I asked if one of their business partners can offer something (knowing that they work with Austrian and Lufthansa) the option was on the table yet Swiss refuse. 
I depart from Tel Aviv to Zurich on the 13.12.18 , I‚Äôm an a321 , (not a330) so no entertainment system though it was promised. 
Connection flight was in a bombardier aircraft, that was so small so when other passenger opened the storage above it hit my head. No assistance from swiss staff though I was clearly injured! 

According to Expedia guidelines I contacted Swiss again after I arrived Berlin , and was told there is no problem and the flight will change to 18:45 Pm with a ticketing price of 70‚Ç¨ . I agreed and approved the offer. And hour later I saw the new ticket on the website. 
24 hours before the flight I tried to check in on line and discovered my ticket is canceled, 
Immediately contacted Swiss again I was told that the payment was not approved (why no one told me? Nor sent me an email? Only god knows) 
The hotel staff spoke with Swiss representatives and they promised to switch to evening flight free of charge as an apology. 
At 14:30 I tried to check in again and no ticket was found. 
Contacted Swiss again and this time they told me I was no show for morning flight so the change was not approved! Asking me to pay 111‚Ç¨ fine which I agreed to pay since I was on a situation that I can‚Äôt argue ! 
Gave them another credit card and a local number for information in case of a problem. 
Arrived the air port, no ticket was found, contacted the ground staff that took care of it and charged me with no problems and guess what again Swiss didn‚Äôt inform me about the payment problem!

Better than expected,Brussels,Dubai,International,"I read some of the reviews and was a bit weary... but in the end it turned out to be a reasonably good flight. The aircraft was new and the seats are good, but as always with any ariline, not enough leg room. The pitch of the seat is better than average, but since the rows are so close together it becomes a nuisance when the passenger in front of you leans all the way back. Impossible to continue watching a movie and when you are eating you bump your head into back of the seat in front of you. A real challenge! They really should do something about this. Having said this, the food and service are better than what you can expect on a flight with any airline. So all in all we were pleased. One thing however that almost ruined our holiday had to do with a wild strike of Swissport luggage handlers in Brussels. They refused to unload the incoming aircraft... As a result we arrived in Z√ºrich with 20 min. to spare. We had to run like crazy to get off the plane, go through border security, take a train, up the stairs to reach gate 59, literally at the other end of the airport. With 5 min. to spare we boarded our flight to Dubai, being the last passengers to board. On the bright side, our luggage made the flight. I don't know how they did this, but everything arrived on time in Dubai. Maybe they should have done this for the passengers as well... Both my wife and daughter have health issues and I can assure you getting there was an ordeal. We were exhausted.

On our return flight I complained to the senior officer (a Woman) at the check-in desk explaing what had happened and kindly sollicitating for a free upgrade. She agreed that were were fully entitled to an upgrade, but that she didn't have the authority to offer this to us. Apparently there is a lot of red tape to go through and you have to do this well in advance (read you will never get an answer)... The senior Employee however offered us two middel row seat (2 x 4) so that we would have a little more space for the 4 of us. This was highly appreciated (and my sincere thanks to this wonderful woman) but an upgrade would have been more appropriate. The idea was that my wife, daughter and grandchild could sleep occupying 3 seats... Sadly this turned out to be impssible since the armrests dont fold all the way back and up. What they have done is make the backrest wider from the middle to the top, to create the impression (illusion) that the seats are really wide (which is not the case). Nice trick but if you are on a flight which is not fully booked as was the case for us, forget about lying down... Anyway, all in all still a good review for this airline. We had worse, even in a A380! 

Before you book check out the legroom and pitch and very important how many seats there are across.  In a triple7 from boeing i.e. which was designed to have 9 seats across, many cramp in one extra seat, also Swiss, to carry more passengers. High time that airlines start to realize that some passengers like me, 1,85 m tall don't fit in these chairs. The synonym 'cattle class' was not invented by me, but accuratly describes what flying long haul has become these days. So airlines... do something about it and start listening to your customers. Not all of us can afford to pay for business and first. (:-)",December 2018,"December 26, 2018",4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Food was just OK, nothing special for business.  The entertainment system was mediocre, and unavailable until you have taken off and reached altitude, whereas most of the on-demand systems nowadays are available as soon as you board in business.

Zurich to Boston,London,Boston,International,"Routing:  LX332 London to Zurich then LX52 A340 aircraft Zurich to Boston U.S.A..  

I am comparing my experience to British Airways and Virgin Atlantic

SWISS onboard is excellent and happily, as of December 2018, it is the traditional legacy carrier service for trans-atlantic long-haul flights: drinks service after take-off, main meal service, snack service consisting of pizza and ice cream, another drinks service.  All inclusive including baggage in the ticketing price.

Main meal was well-prepared turkey with red cabbage and potatoes, all very good and tasty.  There was a salmon and potatoe salad starter and small parfait desert thingy.   There were three (3) trolley drink services and I made one trip to the galley for an additional glass of wine. 

Cabin seating and space is average but nice seating material throughout the cabin making for a smart appearance.

More than adequate number of attentive cabin attendants to take care of a full flight.  Attendants were accommodating and provided the expected legacy-type of onboard service. 

Only complaint was the inflight movie system stops mid-way through the movies and you have to restart the system which will reset to the point in the movie that it stopped.  Problematic but not terrible. 

Why SWISS?  I live in London and use BA and Virgin for trips to the eastern U.S..  Economy fares in December were running +¬£800 rountrip excluding baggage . . another ¬£60 each way per bag and then the onboard ridiculous costs for drinks, food, etc..   Swiss was running a special for ¬£376 (I waited at first and then finally paid ¬£431) all inclusive if you flew via Zurich.

13 hours of hell,New York City,Tel Aviv,International,"Usually I fly with another company that has direct flights from NY to TLV. This time, because of the holidays rush I too a Swiss via Zurich flight.
The first flight -from NY to Zurich was in an ancient airbus. The only good thing I can say about this flight is that the food is eatable. Seat were extremely bad and leg space was incredibly small. The touch screen has some internal issues and you have to use the little device inserted under the arms. The push button did not release back the chair and I had to sit straight during the 7 hours flight. I though to myself ""Swiss still thinks we are cattle!"" little did I know that on the second flight (which was late!) the space for the legs will be even worse and there will be no screens at all! On both flights there was no air condition directed to each person - so you can imagine the stench. Altogether the flights were absolutely terrible. 
  
 There's a lot of competition around and the fact we can use this platform to report this - may help to change things. 
*Dear Swiss*- both planes needs to retire or re-organized. Leg space is crucial - along with air conditioning and media systems upgrade. Since we are in 2019- an electricity plug is highly important as well.",December 2018,"December 22, 2018",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0

However, on my last three flights in a row from ZRH to TLV, in May, July and December 2018, was unable to complete the online check-in at Zurich. 23 hours prior to departure, as advertised by the airline as a major feature, the check-in didn't provide me the expected and promised seat allocation. My 1st two complaints in this regard didn't yield a reasonable answer. In December, have called Swiss service's phone number  and after almost 15 minutes on the line have received a seat. The official mentioned the fact that am blocked for the feature but couldn't provide an explanation. My written complaint wasn't answered yet. Three cases in a row hint at a statistically significant snag.

Good experience,London,Zurich,Europe,"We travelled from London Heathrow to Zurich, on our way to Colombo, Sri Lanka a few days ago. Although we were delayed by 2 hours, due to bad weather, once on board the flight staff were excellent, apologising for the delay, although clearly not their fault. The seat pitch was not great for me at just over 6ft, but the food and service was not at fault. If there was a criticism, it was that we could have been kept informed of the actual time delay at the airport, instead of staring at a 'delayed' message for nearly 2 hours. However, this is likely to be an issue for Heathrow's staff. Unfortunately, we missed our connecting flight to Colombo, but the ground staff organised a good hotel, transport and food in an efficient manner.

I would definitely recommend Swiss Airlines.",,"December 20, 2018",4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,,,
Not a high-flying experience,Tokyo,Zurich,International,"While I usually choose SWISS for my flights between Tokyo and Zurich mainly because of the direct connection and the attractive price, the experience in recent years (at least in Economy class) is not as good as what I think it should be for an airline that prides itself on its high quality. A few things that left a bit of a sour taste on my latest flight:
- Second time in a row that I was in a seat where the Entertainment System wasn't working properly (sound only on one side). Replacing the earphones didn't make a difference, so I assume it was the equipment in the seat. It's not much fun to watch a film if you hear only half of the sound!
- Toilet seat seemed to be falling apart. Couldn't lift the seat (i.e. it didn't stay up).
- Whenever I put the table back up, the cup holder came crashing down. Very annoying.
- My seatbelt buckle was dirty. 
- Cabin attendants on SWISS flights always hand out chocolate shortly before landing. I was wondering this time why they didn't. Until I got up from my seat when getting off the plane, and saw the chocolate lying on my seat. I have to assume that they put it there while I was in the bathroom. Not a very intelligent choice, and for me a bill from the dry cleaners, as I was wearing beige slacks and only noticed at my destination that it I couldn't wear them for the rest of my trip because of the dark brown spot the melted chocolate must have left there!

I get the feeling that the maintenance and cleaning of SWISS aeroplanes leave quite a bit to be desired. Or perhaps they should think about investing in new planes...

As for the choice the cabin attendant apparently made with the chocolate, I'm not really sure what to say...",December 2018,"December 20, 2018",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0

(‚Ç¨40) On both outward and inward trips I was sent an email informing me that my seat had changed. Why did I pay ‚Ç¨40 to pick a seat for it then to be changed by Swiss Air. 
On the flight back to Dublin the air vent above my head was broken which meant cold air was blowing on me constantly. I asked a member of cabin crew could I move and she said she would be back to me. But never did. For the duration of the flight I wore a hat and had to cover myself with a coat from the draught.

Fell short of high expectations,Athens,Boston,International,"We had very high expectations of SWISS based on friends' experiences. The staff was generally good but they seemed to forget about me and my wife more than a couple times especially after we've requested for something (a cup of water, a fork, etc.). They even failed to wake us during breakfast service so we landed quite hungry. Maybe it was because it was too close to landing time but they weren't able to accommodate our request for breakfast which was very disappointing.

The plane unfortunately was an older model so the hard product also failed to live up to expectations for business class. Bad luck on our part I suppose that we ended up an older plane.

I'm hoping our experience was just a one-off as other friends who've flown business class with SWISS had nothing but high praise for them. Although I will add, SWISS Business Class Lounge in Zurich is absolutely amazing!",November 2018,"December 20, 2018",3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0

We opted for the cab and were given information as to how to claim our reimbursement for the cost of the cab.This all happened on September 4th. We filed our claim on September 7th and got a response of receipt. When nothing happened we contacted them again and they did respond. As of a few weeks ago they just ceased responding to my queries as to the status of my claim. There was no mention of any dispute and all documentation had been furnished.

At check-in, they asked for a new US Immigration Paper for Swiss citizens - a form which did not exist on our last flight to the US (5 years ago). We did not have it because nobody mentioned.  The Swiss staff was very helpful and did the tedious computer work for us. Departure time got closer and closer and the US Immigration server did not accept the Swiss clerk's entry. 
He had to start the 45 minutes procedure (for 2 persons) all over again. Of course, we missed the plane. The Swiss staff went out of their way to find 2 seats on the evening flight to Boston, it worked.

Our flight in Dubai was delayed by 45 minutes. When we got on the flight before take off a woman (who was in the same row as us, row 37) started screaming and swearing at the man behind her because he was kicking her chair. The 'f' word was used by the both of them continuously for 2 minutes. We were travelling as a family of 5 including my 7yr old and 10 year old. They were very scared. Those people should have been taken off the flight but your stewards did NOT even approach them.
In Zurich because of the delay and the plane not gaining permission to land we missed our connecting flight to Manchester. New boarding cards were issued to fly us to Frankfurt then Manchester. Why do you have a connecting flight with a short time if your planes are always delayed.
When we finally landed in Manchester our luggage had not arrived. 5 pieces. 
We have been promised it will be delivered today. I am very worried about the condition they will be in.
I was in tears when we had been waiting at the carousel for 40 minutes and our luggage did not arrive.
We had had the flight(s) from hell. Obviously by changing us from swiss airlines to Lufthansa caused the problem. I even said to the woman at the airport what about our luggage? She assured me our luggage would be on board.
So we were supposed to arrive at 8am in Manchester but arrived after 12pm with no luggage. The kids were exhausted and they had witnessed a spectacle on the flight. So please swiss airlines, please tell us what was our fault in all this and why do I feel utterly upset and disgusted when I should have been feeling refreshed after my holiday.

Booked directly via Swiss Air web site. Keep in mind that published fares for this airline does not include your seat. So if you want a specific seat you need to purchase it. I purchased two seats so my husband and I could sit together and be over or near the wing. 
When I booked the flight I also requested a special meal (Gluten free). On the day of the flight as well as the return flight they had the meal on the food cart and they knew I was the person who requested it. A much better experience in this regard vs US airlines. 
Food was good, seats were comfortable (as best as they could do in coach class) and their selection on movies, etc. was good.

When the Stewardess explained that it was for an Economy Class passenger, he hissed venomously:""Pillows are only for Business Class Passengers"". We heard this because we were sitting in the ""separation row"" just behind the Business Class. The Stewardess returned crestfallen - she did not know how to best explain his unfortunate behaviour.

As some background information Swiss is the only major airline to fly to where my family lives. I booked business class to make it as comfortable for myself as possible and since I knew that had requests to add on to my booking I found it fair to do this. After 2 calls to Swiss Air, and 2 calls to the airlines that were operating the flights, the third person I spoke to at Swiss airline confirmed to be that everything was done and booked, took my credit card details and said that everything was done. It was not! 2 weeks and several hours of calls later I found out that they could not accommodate my requests, even though they had charged me and booked my tickets. I proceeded to cancel my ticket, did not get an explanation, apology or any information what had happened. Just that it I wanted them to accommodate my requests I would have to rebook my tickets from scratch, for more than twice as much money as my booking had cost.

SWISS TEACH YOUR EMPLOYEES MANNERS!!!,Zurich,Athens,Europe,"Gate A66, Friday 14.12.2018 Swiss Flight LX1838 from Zurich to Athens at 13.05: A very arrogant young male employee of Swiss working at the counter of Gate A66 demanded in the most rude way to weight my hand luggage. He specifically chose me out of 150 other passengers with hand luggage bigger than mine and demanded to weight my hand luggage! He claimed it was overweight as he found it 9,3 kilos instead of 8 but when I tried to explain him that I had bought 2 kilos of chocolate at the airport, which I had put inside the hand luggage, he wasn‚Äôt listening to me! He was yelling at me in front of the other passengers, trying to make me feel bad with sarcastic comments about my ‚Äúlight fare ticket‚Äù and before we even sort out the issue he asked for my credit card in order to charge me for the extra weight!!! As far as I‚Äôm concerned, things that are bought at the airport are not included in the weight limitation of the hand luggage.

My only gripe was with young woman seated in front of me who felt entitled to recline her seat fully so she could lounge while watching her programs and eating her meal. I asked her politely to raise the seat back a bit, and she seemed quite resentful, so I repeated my request to the flight attendant and got some results.

They were trying to cover up with an ""extraordinary circumstances"" so they don't have to dish out any compensation. By EU law, airlines has to compensate 600 Euro for each of their passengers for any delay over 3 hours unless it was due to some ""extraordinary circumstances"".

One of the phone calls, I spent 55 mins and I only spoke to an operator for 5mins in this call and the rest was just waiting on hold.

Swiss cheese,San Francisco,Cairo,International,"Too many holes in their service!!! First off I hadn‚Äôt seen my wife , children or sick mother in twenty months. So after a long wait, naturally I collected many gifts for them. Enough to purchase three additional bags to check in. 
I arrived early at the airport as to weigh the luggage and make any adjustments to comply with their standard twenty three kilo or fifty pound limit per piece. Four of the five were over the limit but I was willing to pay the extra weight. After all, these are my families items they‚Äôd been waiting for. 
Upon arrival at the counter, the agent and her luggage assistant weighed everything and calculated my extra weight to cost $806!!! My ticket was for that much!! I asked if there was anything I could do like buy an extra piece from the shop and disperse the added weight there. She said ‚Äú no, it‚Äôll still be the same!‚Äù Even though the extra piece of luggage checked at the airport is $287. I became frustrated but had no choice until her supervisor arrived. Luckily he knew better and allowed me to buy the extra piece at $287. I checked in and proceeded to the gate.
On the plane, I purpose pre-checked and selected the last window seat in a three seat row after noticing the flight wasn‚Äôt full. My hope were to be able to lay down across all three seats. Of course that didn‚Äôt happen, oh well.
The actual seats weren‚Äôt comfortable as the cushions were old. Additionally, there was no leg rest underneath the chair in front of me to rest my feet on as not to slide forward.
The food....we were told there‚Äôs a meat option and vegetarian one. By the time they made their way to me, the chicken was finished and I there was left was macaroni and cheese!!! With a bit of broccoli... what??? Growing up in the states, I rarely ever ate that because I don‚Äôt like it!! And I‚Äôm not a kid!!!

Not a pleasant experience...,Zurich,Valencia,Europe,"I was flying on Swiss from November 29 to December 4, 2018 to get into Valencia for the Marathon on December 2, 2018.  I booked my flight on kayak and didn‚Äôt realize that I was booked as eco light, which apparently meant that a checked bagged is not included for an international flight from USA (which I was completely unaware).  Basically upon my arrival from USA to Zurich before my transfer to Zurich, one of the Swiss air representatives decided to randomly select me to weigh my bag and basically told me that I was forced to check my bag in because it‚Äôs over the 8kg weight limit for carry ons.  Interestingly enough where I left from in USA, they did not weigh my bag and I had no issues with bringing my carry on as is during the international flight.  Not great........ 
Then prior to coming back to USA, I thought it would be wise to check my bags in because I knew that the baggage weight would exceed the 8kg carry on limit, especially with the amount of things I bought to bring home from Valencia.  So the website said that if you purchase check in baggages before three hours of your departure that there is a ‚Äúspecial price.‚Äù  I thought that this was an option when I was checking in and of course it was not.  I tried multiple times to purchase the check in bag option so I would not be over charged as written on the Swiss website at the airport.  After multiple unsuccessful attempts, I decided to call the 1-888 number and I was ‚Äúassisted‚Äù by Melissa.  Her ‚Äúassistance‚Äù was more of giving me pushback and telling me that purchasing check in bags prior to my flight is not an option because I had already checked in (which was absolutely absurd because there was no option during online check in to purchase the bags).  She told me I would have to pay the higher price at the airport.  I literally read what the Swiss website said word for word and then she retracted and said she would go and ask one of her colleagues for help and finally helped me figure out how to purchase the check in bag online before three hours of my departure time.  
Definitely not a fan of their customer service considering she gave me pushback times 2 and I had to read to her the policy of Swiss from the website and be forceful about it before she actually started ‚Äúassisting‚Äù me....

Oh and not to forget to mention that my flight back from Zurich to USA that they constantly ran out of non vegetarian meals when they got to me (I do love veggies, but I really needed the protein as I was recovering from the marathon 1.5 days ago...) Really?! I guess that was my fault that I did not realize that eco light means that you get treated basically like second class...

Lost Baggage and very bad customer service followup!,Stuttgart,Cairo,International,"I was flying from Stuttgart to Cairo on Swiss Air, and when I arrived to Cairo I didn't find my luggage, I filled an immediate complain at the airport. the bag had some very important staff that I urgently needed.

I started following up with their customer service representative via e-mail and phone and they were very slow in responding and very much careless about the impact of this delay or possible loss on me!

Hot cabin,Miami,Zurich,International,"Overnight flight from Miami on a Boeing 777. My wife and I got different seats than what we picked online. We got stuck in the center 4 seats, in the middle 2 seats, with 2 sleepers controlling the isles. To top that...the cabin was hot (sweat down your back). When we complained that we were sweating for 10+ hours, the flight crew said they were not going to lower the temperature. If they did then people would complain that it's too cold...isn't that what the free blankets are for? The Boeing 777 does not have individual A/C over head spouts that you can control. The 777 has a long A/C vent running along the length of the plane, that the crew controls 100%. The leg room was tight on this plane. The same airlines on the way back home flew a Airbus 380 and that to me is a much better and more comfortable plane.

Good Service - Hard Seats,Zurich,Los Angeles,International,"I flew Swiss from ZRH to LAX and I had booked the flight through United which served the other legs of the flights, along with Austrian.
Coming in from Stockholm on Swiss Air they announced that TSA precheck would be offered on my flight to the US. Great!
A few days later I was going through security at ZRH and asked several officials at the airport about TSA precheck. Nobody had an idea what that was. There was only the general security, which, luckily was fast enough. So far, so good. Then came boarding. I was surprised to see such a mass of people at a relatively small gate. It was difficult to see which line (or cluser pof people) was waiting to board and which line was trying to get the extra security sticker. Boarding itself was just plain chaotic. I am used to boarding groups being called, or, at least, lines being arranged for the passengers - no such thing here, just 400 people shoving and pushing through the one gate with the scanner for the boarding passes. In 20 years of flying I have rarely seen such chaos.
On the plane, I had the chance to ask two flight attendants about the boarding experience. Both were flabbergasted and pretended not to have noticed anything. Also, boarding groups did not seem to ring a bell. Needless to say, the flight was delayed from the beginning because of the unorganized boarding.
The airplane itself was clean, and service was really good. Several meals were served, and people came by non-stop to offer more water, coffee, etc.
The entertainment system offered a good variety of European movies, which I always enjoy, because you never get to see anything from that part of the world in the US.
After 3 hours I noticed that the seats were unusually hard. I am used to sitting 8 to 10 hours on a transatlantic flight, which I am doing 2 - 3 times per year,. This time was different: I had to get up and stand for a long time. I would have preferred to not sit down at all, and the rest of the trip was painful.",November 2018,"December 4, 2018",3.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,4.0
A340-300 Business Class ZRH-NRT (12hrs 25min),Tokyo,Zurich,International,"A340-300 Business Class ZRH-NRT (12hrs 25min). 

SWISS is one of those greedy airlines, flying on business and I could not reserve a seat because I would have to pay 250$ plus to reserve one of the single seats. I did not do it. 

Then I waited till the 24 hrs before departure to choose a seat during the check-in process. They had asigned me an aisle seat in the middle with no window. At the check-in in NRT they weighed my hand baggage and told me that I had to get rid of 2 kgs... may be she was right but for the price the ticket costs, two kgs and the few cabin baggage in Business Class...it should not be a problem. 

The cabin is outdated. The seat it is not comfortable. The screen is really small and outdated. Service is nothing special. The entertainment system was not working , my screen had to be rebooted 5 times. I just managed to start 5 movies and I just manages to complete one. 

For the same price and if it is an A340, I would recommend any other airline. I do not specially like the SWISS crews, generally have an attitude issue , specially if you were travelling in Economy. 

SWISS is way far from the Qatar Airways Business Class (that most probably would be comparable to the First Class of other airlines), QR is definitely way much better. 

After arriving ZRH (approx 16 hrs) I had a transfer flight out of Terminal A. The lounge was modern but so crowded and no seats, then I decided to leave the ""lounge"" furthermore , the food was not appealing.

Silly carry on lagguage policy,London,Zurich,Europe,"What a pity that a reputeted airlines offers a poor service on lagguage policy (poorer and less efficient that the one that European low cost airlines apply today).
I bought a light fare (carry on lagguage only). Because I had to carry a Christmas gift (a bottle of champagne I received at very last), I asked to check in my only piece of lagguage. Because the weight was 0,8 kg above the allowance, they asked me to pay GBP 35.00 to check it in. I complained saying that the flight was overbooked and having 1 piece less in the cabin would have been if great benefit for all the passengers (considering also that I was assigned an emergency exit door). The attendant answer that he could check it in for free if I made my lagguage below the allowance. Thus, I had to take my suite jacket off from lagguage, carry it on my arm... That seems to me (a frequent flier on gold status within stars alliance) just a poor and silly way to make just less uncomfortable my flight experience.
I really wish Swiss will review its inflexible way to apply policies.
BTW, the flight departed 40 minute delayed... and -obviosly on a fully booked flight- the crew had to dolve problems and discusdions to fit all the carry on lagguage in the overhead beans...

Disgrace on business class,Canton of Geneva,Zurich,Domestic,"One of the key reasons for flying Swiss business class is being granted access to the business class lounge; Particularly prior to a long flight where I like to chill in the lounge to relax for 2 to 3 hours. (Catching connecting flight LX176 from ZRH to SINGAPORE). 

On the first sector I checked in at Geneva airport 3 hours before my flight and asked about the Swiss Lounge location. Instructions were given regarding the location. (no indication was even hinted that it was not ready) 

Upon my arrival in the Geneva Swiss Lounge; I was told it was under renovation where a voucher was given to me for just 1 drink & 1 sandwich at a designated cafe. 

At any Swiss lounge there are no such limits. 

Why was no alternative lounge arranged ?

This arrangement is absolutely not compatible to the usual Swiss business class service. 

I was told by Swiss staff the cafe was 2 minutes away. This proved to be not true; even if you could run there. Struggling with my 2 heavy hand luggage (with no wheels) the journey actually took 10+ minutes to walk there; where there was no signage how to get there. (and why are there no trolleys at the GVA airport after security clearance !! ) Swiss is the second largest customer of GVA after EasyJet. Swiss has the power to insist to GVA senior management that they should provide trolleys to passengers. 

To add insult to injury, the cafe was packed full with no tables to even sit down to rest, after my struggle to eventually get there. 

I was totally exhausted & frustrated. 
I gave up ! 

I struggled back to the gate waiting for 2 hours with no drink or food. I could not leave my luggage at the seating area alone, whilst getting some refreshments from the cafe. It‚Äôs obviously not possible to carry my 2 hand luggage; plus getting drinks & some food. You need 4 hands for that. 

It was my worse experience with Swiss. 

I felt very let down. It‚Äôs a disgrace. Your competitors would never treat a business class passenger with such disregard. 

I was Super-stressed, exhausted and angry. 

All this could have been avoided. 

I must protest in the strongest manner & I want this complaint to be elevated to Swiss Senior Management to get their House in order.

Terrible customer service,Newark,Zurich,International,"Where to begin...you arrive for a international flight at least 2 hours before the flight to then find out your flight is delayed during the boarding time. The boarding time was continuous pushed at 10minute increments. The gate keepers then announce there is a technical difficulty on the flight, which resulted in doors not working. They then selected rows 14-26 to cone up to speak to the desk. I was then told my seat was fine- and hour went by and they called up all of the guests that they told the flight was OK to tell them they can't get on a flight tonight. Christian was one of the men at the gate that was extremely unprofessional. The whole airline had terrible customer service and nobody was willing to help the customers that pay them thousands of dollars to get on these flights. 

After this we were all told to get on line to try to find a new flight. I was told there were none to then have to push back to get on a flight more than 24 hours later. There was no discount offered, I was giving a worse seat then my flight I had originally paid for. Then I was told to go to the carousel to pick up my luggage- which went without me to the final destination. I was told that the airline was under staffed and that was the excuse for them not getting everyone's luggage to them.",December 2018,"December 1, 2018",1.0,,,,,,,,
Not as good as it sounds,New Delhi,Zurich,International,"The very word Swiss conjures up images of a rich and beautiful country with world class living standards. So it was but natural for us to decide to fly Swiss airline with high expectations to Zurich for a holiday.  That logic was flawed. Swiss airlines was as bad as any other low cost International airline despite being the flag carrier of the fabled country.

The problem was not the service from the ground staff or the air crew ;they were all well trained and carried out their duties as per their training. Many reviews have also mentioned delays but  both our Delhi to Zurich and Zurich to Delhi landing times were quite punctual although there were some delays during take off. 

The problem as I see was the airlines management who have tried to save money by cutting costs at every turn.  The plane was old and the cabins,seats and  toilets were all ill maintained. Seats were ultra cramped , the entertainment material was limited and stale and recycled, The display screen was small and just a few inches from my nose when the seat in front was reclined. The entire  row shakes and creaks  when a passenger shifted in his / her seat. It was impossible to watch any thing. Switching to music I found the ear buds hard and the sponges worn out. The sound was deplorable. Both Video and music were more a pain than pleasure. 

On both flights, food and refreshments like roti rolls and pasta were well packed and served efficiently but I discovered later they were unappetizing  and was better left packed and returned . These food can be better described as some kind of fast food which I never eat.

The chocolates and cheese were an exception but not the ice cream.

I would most certainly visit Switzerland again  I would take any low cost flight if I wanted to save money and put up with the inconvenience or pay more and travel a better airline like Emirates or Singapore.

 I would never pay more and put up with inconvenience . I would never fly Swiss airlines believing it to be of the same standard as their fabled country.",October 2018,"December 1, 2018",2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2.0

Wish we didn‚Äôt choose to fly Swiss for our honeymoon!,New York City,Dubai,International,"We flew Swiss airlines last month for our honeymoon, with a final destination to Dubai, UAE. I honestly wish we would have paid the extra money and flown Emirates. We didn‚Äôt know what to expect because neither one of us had flown Swiss before. We moved our seats since we‚Äôre both tall, and got a row behind the exit. To say the least, if your in economy, the fit is tight. Really tight even for an average person. To add insult to injury, the seats move all the way back, so if you have a rude and completely mindless person in front of you(sadly,we did) your at a complete loss. I tried to politely ask the flight attendant if we could move our seat, and didn‚Äôt make a big deal, but spoke to her privately. Business class had almost half a dozen empty seats and she said we had to pay an extra 1,000 Swiss franks, which is about the same as a 1,000 US currency. They were empty the whole flight, yet they would rather keep them empty instead of accommodating two extremely uncomfortable passengers. We sat back in our seats, and endured a 7.5 hour flight to Switzerland praying the connection flight wasn‚Äôt as terrible as this one.

Class Airline,London,Cairo,International,"Full A320 LHRZRH with an adequate 31‚Äù pitch for the relatively short flight and just 5 minutes late in arriving. I liked the way in which Gate staff monitored each passenger‚Äôs baggage as we entered the airbridge, taking some oversize/extra bags for the hold and weighing others which appeared over the 8kg limit: a great policy which speeds up the boarding process and allows maximum room in the cabin for small luggage.

There were no meals or refreshments offered. No assistance provided. More than that when a request for assistance has been raised it was denied at the airport counter.

My repeated requests for the issue to be addressed have been left unanswered or answered in an inappropriate manner. My attempts to contact the airline both online and over the phone have not yet received an adequate response.

Comfortable and swift,Mumbai,New York City,International,"We took the Swiss flight to JFK via Zurich. This was the first time to take our son on an international vacation and that too such a long distance. One of our priorities were to ensure this long journey to be a comfortable one for him and also we reached our destination in a reasonable time. Only Swiss Air could ensue both of  these were met, albeit at a slightly higher cost.
The gate for the connecting flight being at the same terminal E at Zurich, was like an icing on the cake. Lesser connecting time (3 hours layover) and less distance to cover is absolutely ideal. Moreover, the Zurich airport is very quite and pleasant unlike the other busy hubs like Frankfurt & Heathrow. Also, my earlier experience through Abu Dhabi was not so memorable.
We reached JFK at 2pm, and were well within time for a couple of drinks and dinner will our relatives.
The only thing we could point out for improvement is that the airline staff could have been cordial especially towards  families travelling with children.

Poor Service or Harassment?,Zurich,Vienna,Europe,"I live part time in Switzerland and I am a Miles-and-More Senator member, hence I shouldbbe flying Swiss a lot more frequently.  Unfortunately in recent years I have avoided flying Swiss because the service is really poor compared to other StarAlliance airlines.  The crew is often arrogant and rude.  It is impossible to redeem free tickets during popular travel months.  And now it costs extra to have my preferred business class seat.   My latest experience just adds to the list.  Yesterday my husband and I were on LX3558 (code-shared with Austrian airline) from Zurich to Vienna.  When we were waiting for boarding, a Swiss ground staff came over and told me that my carry-on bag was too big for the cabin hold and had to be checked in.  I had never had any problem taking my carry-on into any aircraft but he insisted and said the flight was full.  It was nearly 8pm so we were already late for a 7:50pm scheduled departure,  I really did not want to have to wait for checked luggage at Vienna but I agreed thinking if the flight was full, we should all contribute a little.  However, after he made a big show of making me check in my carry-on, he hassled no one else.  I looked around and saw that several passengers had bigger carry-ons than I did but were not bothered.  I seemed to be his single target for some reason.  Unhappy with this revelation, I decided to take my carry-on into the plane anyway.  My case fit into the overhead compartment without any problem.  Thankfully the crew was from Austrian airline.  Not only did they not make a fuss about my case, they even helped me remove the checked luggage tag.  I don't know how else to call this incident other than pure harassment.  Is it because I am Asian or a woman?   I have no idea but I do know I will try even harder in the future to avoid any flight associate with Swiss.",November 2018,"November 21, 2018",1.0,,,,,,,,

Leg room better on Bombardier CS300,Dublin,Zurich,Europe,"The flight from Dublin to Zurich was on a Bombardier CS300 I think. I took a photo of the safety brochure but cannot find it.

The Bombardier has three seats on one side and two on the other. I choose the seat at the back near the toilets as it is more practical and I wanted to take photos so the wings do not block me taking reasonable photos.

I was lucky on the way back at the seat beside me which is an aisle seat was vacant. I could use the table to put my drink and coffee. There is also a small quiche.

Service is good and one of the toilets but I now not sure on which flight was really spacious. First time ever.

Swiss have a baggage allowance of 23 kgs while Aer Lingus is only 20 kgs. I like to bring back some sausages, black and white pudding, rashers and brown bread which I cannot get here. Swiss also offer a drink and something to eat.

I have only the complaint that the leg room or room one has when the table id down is not great and when you are a little bit of a tummy then it is uncomfortable.

Cancelled connection flight twice during my second time traveling with Swiss - No Reason,New York City,Moscow,International,"I arrived from New York (JFK) to Geneva (GVA) on time as per itinerary via SWISS airline. As soon as I got there SWISS told me that the flight is cancelled without giving any specific reason. They took my connecting flight boarding pass. They told me you need to figure this out with Swiss or call them. I didn't have phone working there internationally in Geneva and no SWISS person helped. I was stuck there without any help, I had to get out to customs to go to swiss terminal. At the terminal, I told SWISS I have another flight from Moscow (DME) to Krasnoyarsk (KJA) at 10pm the same day, they provided no help. They told me it is your responsibility even though SWISS cancelled the flight. I was re-routed to London then to Moscow (DME) but arrived way too late and lost the second flight as well and all money. I had to spend the night at the hotel in Moscow and call the next flight pay money to book a morning flight. I had requested SWISS if they can give me an earlier flight but no help, I had a 14 hours difference for my Moscow flight and they could have helped. This is the second time SWISS has done this to me at Geneva, I had a connection flight last year and they cancelled as soon as I arrived at Geneva. This is ridiculous and they are not helping or taking responsibility. I had to spend entire day in Geneva, Many hours in re-route London without food, missed my flight in Moscow, had to make international 2 hour call to get a new flight from Moscow, had to pay for hotel and food.

However, boarding took also longer and wasn't announced by seat rows which makes it faster.

Boarding not by rows - Not very friendly staff,Montreal,Zurich,International,"The boarding in Montreal was completely ""open"" once First and Business class passengers were on the plain. No first entries for families with small children, no calling out by rows a.s.o. - just nothing! Thus the boarding in Economy was quite chaotic!

Being Swiss I expected the flight a bit ""like comig home already"" (Swiss has an advertisment going in that direction), but was quite disappointed. In the Airbus A330-300 the room between rows was narrow. The man in front of me reclined all the way and when dinner was served he wasn't asked to get his chair in a upright position. Eating squeezed in like that was very difficult! 

In the time between the servings of dinner and breakfast, no-one ever came by with a class of water or juice - no FA to be seen. At least one toilet ran completely out of paper before an FA even noticedl 

For breakfast we were served a box that contained all the things Swiss probably considers us to need for breakfast (ratzher poor choice!). Only the croissants were warm but nothing else (e.g there was no omelette or similar)! No one was asked if the box provided was the thing they wanted - it was just given to you without commentary.

Incredible small pitch,London,Hong Kong,International,"We chose Swiss as we were looking for a cheaper option to a direct flight and the shorter flight from Europe to Asia.
There were  several problems:
1. You do not board by numbers but en masse so the people in row 20 are blocking the access for those in rows 40+.This must delay departure as we were always late in 4 flights.
2. The pitch of the economy was incredible small .I am  not tall 5 10 (1.78) but it was painful for me to get in and out .Good job my bladder was strong doe an 11 hour flight. Coming back I managed to get a n aisle seat which meant I could expand into the aisle  at the expense of being trollied on a regular basis.
I did get offered the option to make a bid for the up market seat but the minimum offer was around ¬£1000 so considering that we only payed ¬£1000 for us both for there and back so to pay ¬£2000 for one leg  made no economic sense.
3. The flight from London come sinto one terminal and leaves from another  one whih requires time and effort to find.Once you left the immediate area of the palne you were on your own to find the connection. Especially difficult on the reurn journey as the transfer time wasonly 20 odd minutes and we had to go through security (shoes of f /belt off) and then get down the terminal. Very stressful.
The good news was that our bags did not make the flight but were delivered safe and sound the next day 120 miles away from Heathrow.

Did we pay too little and should have expected the problem? I don't think I have seen such a small aperture for  a seat even on Ryan air and Easyjet so to have this little  space for over 11 hours is too little..",November 2018,"November 4, 2018",5.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0

This one however, the boarding at Zurich Airport was a free for all. Meaning the boarding procedure was messy. Some people were even cutting the queue. Another bad thing was that the FAs dont ask the person infront of you to recline their seat during meal service, the FA just asked me to adjust the way i eat?!?! SERIOUSLY? The guy infront of me was on full recline while i tried to eat during meal service. And no, the person infront was not sleeping. While the IFE is good, the seats on this configuration (B777-300ER) was super cramped. On other airlines, the economy on the 777s would have a 3-3-3 configuration, Swiss has a 3-4-3 configuration. Im 1.79m in height and the legroom wasnt so good. I am comparing based on my SQ and LH experience which had way better legroom. To be fair with Swiss, the Food was very good.

Beware Swiss Business class in Boeing 777-300ER!,Zurich,Hong Kong,International,"The configuration of the Business Class seats in this plane is unusual in that all seats are definitely not equal.

These small double seats also have no other storage space so everything has to be thrown under your feet on the floor. The middle section of the Business class cabin has two seats side by side for the entire length but these have more space, with individual side tables for each passenger. Look closely at the seat configuration before you reserve your seats and definitely don't book the double window seats unless you're a couple and don't mind sharing the small table space available between you (and also don't mind climbing over your partner to get out if you're on the window!)

My personal problem happened when the gentleman seated next to me was huge, 6'6"" or taller. It was impossible for him not to be spilling into my seat and space (the way Swiss Air seats are supported means that the two inside seats in the central seating area have shared space underneath). I can't blame him for being so large, but I can be annoyed with Swiss Air for not creating a better design for shared space; or seeing that a person that large would have to take up more space than the seating provides and coming up with some sort of  a solution.

Very good flight on Swissair,Zurich,Johannesburg,International,After a trip to Russia we flew business class from Moscow to Zurich and then Zurich to Johannesburg. The flights were both comfortable with excellent service and food onboard. The only disappointment was the business class lounges at Moscow and Zurich airports. The lounge at Moscow was small and very hot with no working air conditioner. The selection of food was also limited and quite disappointing. The lounge at Zurich airport was better but still not entirely what I expected from Swissair. The food was adequate but not very good and service was limited.

An excellent first class product on an excellent airline,London,Dubai,International,"This recent long haul flight in first class was very impressive. Service was warm/genuine, attentive and extremely professional. The food and wine was of a very high standard and had real wow factor which is always important in first class. What‚Äôs also refreshing is that everything is so very ‚ÄòSwiss‚Äô, staying true to the airline‚Äôs identity which makes it a more interesting experience. 

Lunch starters were served from a display trolley including beautiful hand carved Balik salmon and an array of other exquisite dishes. The soup was delicious as always and the main courses were equally good, as were the desserts. The meal finished with fine Swiss cheeses and the best chocolates I‚Äôve ever had, from Sprungli. The whole meal was a real ‚Äòexperience‚Äô. 

The amenities were of high quality and the cabin was very comfortable. Seats are spacious but only semi-private. Bedding is excellent.

The only element of the journey that was slightly disappointing was the ground experience in Zurich - it could be so much better. There is no ground service for first class as such, unless your incoming flight meets a bizarre set of specific criteria in which case private transfers to/from the aircraft are offered. If you wish to go from their first class lounge in A gates to their lounge at E gates, then a rather unglamous minivan will take you at set shuttle times like catching a bus. Zurich is also an irritating airport to connect through despite its positive reputation, which makes the lack of a comprehensive first class ground service even more obvious. Their newly renovated lounges are an improvement on what was available before but quite stark/cold and not the most luxurious I‚Äôve experienced. They do have high quality a la carte dining options though. 

Overall I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to recommend Swiss in first class if you are looking for a high quality first class experience on a long haul trip. Their onboard service is excellent in every way. They are definitely one of the best and offer a level of quality/sophistication that many of the Middle East carriers can‚Äôt match, however they are not THE best.

It is every man/woman for themselves, creating a chaotic situation with everyone pushing and shoving to board in order to get the limited overhead space.

As managing partner of my firm we try no everything possible to avoid this airline but not easy if you are based in Zurich. When complaining to Swiss they said it had to do with the capacity of Zurich airport, which is a bad excuse as the other airlines don't seem to have that problem.

There were many passengers with more hand luggage than ourselves - we refused to have our luggage loaded in the hold as it was well within the requirements. Our luggage easily fitted in the overhead lockers on the aircraft, the flight was not full and other passengers had no difficulty stowing their luggage.

Good Flight,Athens,Boston,International,"We normally fly Swiss from Greece to Boston, USA and are generally pleased with the accommodations.  We flew Swiss for our return flight most recently.  The food was hit or miss.  For example, on the shorter flight from Athens to Zurich, they served smoked salmon over lentils, which seemed odd as that type of palette probably doesn't appeal to many people.  On the longer connecting flight, they ran out of the chicken (second time this has happened to me on Swiss) and only had vegetarian available, which is normally not a great option.  I'm not sure if this typically happens on airlines but would advise to not sit near the back of the plane if you want a food selection.  We found out after that you can pre-select your meal on their website.  Because the connection time is so short, there is not really any time to grab food so it was quite disappointing when our only dinner option for the 8 hour flight was the vegetarian.",October 2018,"October 23, 2018",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

NEVER EVER FLYING AGAIN WITH SWISS AIR! THE RUDEST FLIGHT ATTENDANT EVER!,Singapore,Zurich,International,"The rude flight attendant:

Black long hair, length on the shoulder a little bit down. Quite not young. Crock nose and thin lips. 
Becareful if you fly with this flight number. Try your best not to interact with her! I know her name but I still respect her no matter what she did to me. 

A very hurtful incident that should never happened. It all begins from a small thing. 
My son (10yo)felt a little bit unwell. Suddenly he felt a stomach pain. 
He said that he was hungry. While we already fed him with the Double Whopper extra cheese, double large fries and coke. 

It happened when he went into the cabin. 
So, i asked for help. Maybe they have some crackers to hold his pain until the dinner comes. 
I asked to one of the flight attendant, a male, I am asian. Of course I asked politely. Very politely. I do not want to hurt anybody. I just need help for my son. 
He said that i have to wait until all are on board and plane take off and wait until all priorities classes (first and business) serve first then us. 
So, i was thinking that would be on dinner time. That would be too long for him. 
So, i said to this flight attendant that my son had a stomach pain. I just need a crackers. Should he wait for that long with this pain?
He said i have to wait. 
So, i came back to my seat and kept fed my son with water. 
I took that responsibility that i should bring some bread. 
The dinner time was coming. 
After finished it, I brought the trays back, so i can use my lap as a pillow for my son. I will not do that if I was alone. I paid the seat and the service, so, I should enjoy it. 
But my condition was different. 
So, i brought it to the pantry. And one female flight attendant was there, and I smiled to her and said a very nice hello. She was so mad! And said, we will collect all the tray now!! What gonna happened if all bring the trays here! No patience!! No patience!! I said so sorry, I explained to her I bring it because the trays almost fall. She already so mad and shaking so,i did not explain for further. But she knew that my son was feeling not good. 
I said sorry and thank you. She was so mad, no smile (of course) and the lips were tight! 
In my life never ever a flight attendant is so rude! Anyway,
Actually this was the second time i flew with SWISS AIR. Both journey are unpleasant. She made me felt so uncomfortable a whole 13 hours flight! I was SO AFRAID to ask anything. Afraid to get a very unpleasant feedback and service. I kept the dinner for my son. Afraid that she or the other staffs will angry and snobs to me and my son.

Frequent travelers: avoid!,Zurich,Berlin,Europe,"I have to fly frequently to continuously changing destinations for my job, and I am thus using a broad spectrum of airlines. Swiss International Airlines stands out as one of the least reliable major airlines with the worst customer service. Based on my own experience (arguably with limited statistics), it is clearly the worst airline among more than 40 airlines that I have used in the last 10 years. In average there is a medium or major problem with every second flight I take with SWISS - far more frequent than with every other airline.

The only airline that repeatedly puts me on stand-by status despite holding a regular ticket is Swiss International Airlines. Repeatedly SWISS has not allowed me to take carry-on luggage on the airplane, although it clearly conformed to the respective rules. Some of its check-in software did not work at times, causing me quite some inconvenience, but the compensation was not worth the time that it took to redeem it. 

Particularly shocking experiences include a pilot having a meltdown and shouting at all seated passengers before departure, and a flight attendant shouting at customers who politely asked for tea during the in-plane service time (luckily not at me, but it felt very uncomfortable anyway). 

On the occasion of a cancelled flight at an Asian airport, they made all passengers wait at the airport for an entire day to announce alternative travel and accommodation arrangements - something that can take minutes or at most up to one hour with other airlines. More recently, a flight had a delay of more than two hours, but no compensation in form of food vouchers was given prior to departure as required by European law. Emails in this regard have remained unanswered to date. 

The pitch and width of the economy seats are average in the industry, thus there is a very little space. Business class seats for long-haul flights also are mediocre in comparison with other airlines. Business class for short flights consists of a slightly improved meal and seating in front of the plane, and is clearly sub-average. The customer service has a very long response time, which can take from several months to never, and mostly consists of boiler-plate answers - quite different from other airlines (with the exception of Lufthansa). I presume that the miserable quality of its customer service caused by a high number of complaints from unhappy customers. 

Because I am based in Switzerland I can not always get around SWISS for European flights. It is clear that SWISS profits from such a captive audience. For long-haul flights there are good, and usually cheaper alternatives: For flights from Switzerland to Asia most of the big Asian carriers are very reliable and offer great service. For flights to North America, there are some direct flights from Switzerland by North American carriers. The service is similarly mediocre service but they have much higher reliability, better customer service and much better frequent flyer programs. Scandinavian airlines are also great, if you do not mind a stopover in Northern Europe. The Middle Eastern airlines are a great option for Asia and Australia if you do have some extra time and do not mind changing planes in the middle of the night.",February 2018,"October 21, 2018",1.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0

The drawbacks with Swiss when compared to other flights connecting Mumbai to Zurich like ethihaad and emirates is the check-in baggage allowance. Swiss allows only 23 kg whereas others allow 30 kg .
Having travelled in a similar route in other airlines , The leg room is pretty low so legs become cramped quiet often especially for taller people.

Worst Customer Service and Airline to trust and Fly with,Boston,Athens,International,"Airline is beyond unreasonable and disgustingly arrogant.

Made my friend and I miss our connection flight because of Immigration reasons they did not help us with.

We arrive in Athens to find out guess what the bags we were ""promised"" and a phone call was made right in front of us were LOST.

Now we've spent over $900 because Swiss dint check our passports correctly. They then lose our luggage so we have to go purchase clothes, toiletries etc. Costing $400. No one at Zurich could find our bags or contact us...
Now I have filed a complain TWICE and each employee (Mereoni) sent me a check for $176, never replying to my concerns and emails after I never confirmed that this okay to send or ENOUGH! Then to tell me the matter is closed and SWISS has done their job adequately. Ignoring my emails and just sending me a meesly check for $176!!

Not pleased,Zurich,Chicago,International,"Not pleased
All was good with the Swiss boarding and actual flight. 
However, we arrived late in Chicago and missed our scheduled flight.
After rescheduling we went to transfer our luggage to the next flight, to find one piece of luggage missing from the Swiss air flight. After searching, we had missed the second scheduled flight. 
After going back and forth between terminals and having to reschedule for the next day, we ended back at the Swiss air desk located in the international terminal.
We were told by Swiss air personnel  that Swiss air would cover our hotel, taxi, and food. Swiss air personnel  gave us the Swiss Air card with their internet site.  We selected one of their designated hotels with free transport and had a snack in the hotel restaurant. 
1 week later, I sent the necessary documents to the web site for reimbursement. 
The response was, they are not responsible for the need for the hotel and to have my insurance cover the cost.",September 2018,"October 18, 2018",2.0,,,,,,,,
rude and utterly inefficient,Valletta,New York City,International,since june 2018 we have been promised a refund on our lost luggage. they never reply to emails and when they do they keep bringing up excuses for not paying. They keep asking the iban details which are correct. its a shame as one cannot even call the customer care and no number is available to call any other office that one can speak to. When I did call the head office they told me that I couldn't be passed through and that they receive millions of calls like mine for complaints... great airline it is ha!? I suggest one never travels with them as if something goes wrong no chance of your refund.,June 2018,"October 18, 2018",1.0,,,,,,,,

Off to Russia,Zurich,Moscow,Russia,"We flew from Zurich to Moscow in September of 2018. We began our journey by taking the nonstop train from Lucerne to Zurich Flughafen(airport). We got our luggage together and took the elevator from the platform to the airport concourse. Signage at Zurich airport was very good; everything was clearly marked.  We found our terminal and quickly lined up in front of the Swiss counter. Several agents were available and so we had no waiting time.  A very friendly agent immediately checked us in and very soon we were headed for security. The Swiss agent also told us that the airline was part of Lufthansa, another of my favorite carriers.  As usual, the friendly but meticulous security staff cleared us and very soon we were in the departing lounge waiting for our flight to Moscow. Because it was an international flight there was a second passport check at the gate.  Once cleared, we boarded the aircraft, an Airbus 320. The seats were quite comfortable and the cabin crew were stationed at various points inside the aircraft to help passengers get settled.  A nice lunch was served along with choice of beverages and very soon we were looking forward to our destination, Moscow.  All along, the cabin crew kept checking on the passengers in case they needed an extra coffee or a cold drink.  After a smooth flight we landed in Moscow on a sunny afternoon, full of great expectations at the start of an eight-day tour of the city and St. Petersburg.

Never Again,Austin,Krakow,International,"We booked our trip through United in April for September flights. After booking through United, I went to the Swiss Air website and paid to reserve our seats. Fast forward to our day of departure. Upon checking for the first leg of our trip on a United flight, I noticed the seats on the tickets were not the seats we selected and paid for. I then called the ORD Swiss desk, and the rep who answered told me that ‚Äúmy agent canceled our seat assignments‚Äù. When I told her that I booked through United, she said that United canceled the seats. After asking multiple times what can be done, they offered to reverse the fees and nothing else. After getting off the phone, I went to the desk for our United flight, and the agent there confirmed that there was no way United could have changed our seat assignments, as they do not have access to Swiss‚Äô systems. The United agent also told me that Swiss should have offered additional compensation. When we got to ORD, we went to the desk there to see if anything else could be done. They offered to page the passengers in the seats we wanted and see if they‚Äôd be willing to switch. I wasn‚Äôt optimistic, but I said yes, I‚Äôd like to try. The agent never followed through and we were stuck in the middle seats. Apparently, it wasn‚Äôt just us whose seats were reassigned. We sat close enough to the desk and overheard a number of other people complaining about the same thing. 

When we got to ZRH, our next flight was delayed a couple hours because the plane failed the safety inspection...

Finally, after getting back home after our trip, I checked my credit card. We were never refunded the fee. When I called Swiss again, they gave me a specific email address to contact to request a refund. While they did finally refund the fees, they didn‚Äôt even bother to reply to my email to let me know it was done. 

I understand that problems come up. But Swiss‚Äô terrible customer service, multiple lies and total disinterest in trying to resolve the situation means that I will never fly on their airline again and will tell everyone I know to avoid them at all costs.",September 2018,"October 14, 2018",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,

They were not very friendly. I'm not asking for a conversation but when you serve food or drinks a nice gesture would be appreciated . I always make sure that I say please and thank you.

Reason given for delay by pilot was a safety/comfort issue so he knocked back the original plane, so they had to get another aircraft organised.

I've also noticed the increase in toilet smells, so the cleanliness is faultering as I got frequent wafts of faeces on outgoing and return journeys. Return was on HB-IOC, which had a serious incident on 09.03.14.

The CS 100 is deceiving,Warsaw,Zurich,Europe,"The commercial comments about this plane may give you the feeling this is the best airplane in the world. It is what I thought. The reality is meanwhile quite deceiving. The seats are in very high density. Unbelievable. I never saw that, even on low-cost planes or urban buses. I am not a tall guy (1m72), but it was impossible to put my legs in front of me. So the flight was seating in lateral position. This is possible in Business Class as the nearby seat is free. But I imagine the difficulty in Economy Class. No physical separation between classes. The plane is not noisy, but Airbuses are not noisy as well. I had asked for a diabetic breakfast, which included... sugar (not sweetener) for the coffee. Objectively, the EMBRAER planes are much more comfortable.

Do Not Use This Airline,Thessaloniki,Zurich,Europe,They cancelled the flight with no reason given with less than hour before it was due to take off. Delayed the flight to the following day 08:30 and took all passengers to a poor hotel overnight. This is the fourth flight that has been cancelled for me with no proper reason given at the time in the last six months. Customer service is non-existent in Zurich and at best they just don't care. Trying to claim compensation is impossible because they use the excuse that allows them not to pay. My guess is that it is cheaper to cancel the flight if its not full and then not pay compensation.

When we arrived at Athens to check in for our flight home, the representatives let us know that your system hadn't closed our flights there, and since they were open still we'd have to pay a penalty of $400 euro. We have explained many times that we were on those flights and that it must be a system error on your company's behalf, but the representative said the only way to get home that day was to pay that extra fee. She even asked us for evidence that we were on the flights over, and I was able to provide one of the boarding passes, but this wasn't enough. The experience was insulting, frustrating, and honestly felt like extortion. Buyer beware - not only is this a terrible customer service response from Swiss, it is a safety issue.

Worst flight ever,Zurich,Bangkok,International,We bought this flight when considering that it was a long haul flight (nearly 10hrs) and therefore we wanted a comfortable flight expecting Swiss standards. But boy what a disappointment. This was the worst flight I have ever been on and that's saying a lot when considering that I'm a frequent flyer. Forget about leg room because even budget airlines used for short trips have more space. Please note that I'm only 1.57m so if you're any taller than that (which you probably are) goodluck with that. My boyfriend was literallt crouched during the whole flight and therefore neither of us could catch any sleep (first flught ever that I didnt sleep). Our airhostess was like airhostessess you see on comedy movies keeping her very very fake smile even when we adressed her with problems. One instance was when we were given a vegetarian meal and told that they had no chicken left when we asked for it. I mean I have nothing against vegetarian meals but I cannot say the same for my boyfriend. Afterall did we not pay the same price as the other passengers?

Swiss quality indeed!,Rome,Newark,International,"We started from Rome-Fiumicino going to Zurich on flight LX 1737 to connect with flight LX 18 for final destination in Newark. LX 1737 was delayed for unknown reason and we barely had 20 minutes to to connect with LX 18. We thought we will never make the connection because of the distance between the 2 gates and the passport control/security check  that we had to get through. Amazingly, upon landing in Zurich the airline had an agent waiting with a car to zip us through all the hoops. We boarded just in the nick of time before gate closing.

That was the good part, the bad one was that our checked-in luggage did not make onto LX 18, so we arrived in Newark without luggage and we are still waiting for them to be delivered to our house.

I think it is a mistake for SWISS to allow such a short time interval (in this case 45 minutes) for international connecting flights. The reservation system must be fixed. The company made a heroic effort to get us through but not our luggage. Moreover no passengers care for the harrowing suspense of delayed flight and inadequate time to make connection.

It was just too bad for SWISS. The service was great, the seat comfortable, the staff courteous, my rating could have been a 5 but was held at 4 because of the reservation glitch.",October 2018,"October 4, 2018",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Best for long-haul flights,Zurich,Singapore,International,"Thanks to Swiss Airlines, I am not terrified any more by the lack of comfort and bad food in long-haul flights. I had economy tickets from Zurich to Singapore and back this September, with comfortable seats and enough legroom (I'm 1,72m heigh), the food was good, both dinner and breakfast, much better than other airlines offer, with vegetarian meals also. The options for entertainment are good, many new movies and good documentaries, also the crew was nice. What I appreciated the most is that even though reserving a normal seat online is pricey, starting 35 euro, in the airport they agreed to change my automatically selected seat on the boarding pass as I was requesting, if possible, to have an aisle seat for the almost 12h flight. For the outbound flight I was even luckier. They agreed to offer me a window seat this time and above that, this one was an extra legroom seat. I really appreciated they were trying to help me have a pleasant flight. And so it was. I travel abroad almost every month, this was a very pleasant flight and I'm a 100% satisfied future customer.

Incoming flight was delayed; alternative route was horrible,Newark,Venice,International,"The flight coming into Newark must have been delayed so our takeoff was pushed back.  But that only left 20 minutes for a connecting flight.  So Swiss Air rebooked our trip from Newark to London to Frankfurt to Venice, not arriving until early evening.   We had dinner reservations that couldn't be canceled, so this was unacceptable.  I contacted Swiss Air, they told me to contact Expedia.  I contacted Expedia and they said that Swiss Air owned the tickets and only they could change them.

When the person in front put their seat back I could not use my tray table to eat. The stewardess had to ask her to put it up.  Would never fly them again. The airline try to cram in you in. I paid for business on the return flight to avoid the nightmare in the back. The best I have found is Aer Lingus.  They go through Dublin. If you are a little crammed at least is it a shorter flight.

However, Swiss air is not part of the eu and therefore there seems to be no possibility to claim any compensation if there is a delay for any reason. We already experienced a total lack of customer satisfaction during our flight from Amsterdam to Boston, with a delay of 24 hours without any compensation. We fly to the US at least 4 times a year, but we never had such a disappointing customer experience.

First and last time with Swiss Air,Boston,Rome,International,Decided to go with Swiss Air for our trip to Italy because of the reviews. Our first leg was to Florence with a stop over in Zurich. Horrible flight. The leg room was ridiculous. The person in front of my put her seat back and my legs were struggling for space as a result and I am only 5'6. The TVs were poor quality and wouldn't turn off if you didn't want to use them. Multiple people on the plane were putting things over the screens so they could sleep and not have the bright light in there faces. My wife paused a movie at a point when it was dark so she could sleep. I knew when we landed in Zurich and had to get to our connecting flight that our return trip was going to be a problem. We had enough an hour and half for our connecting flight to Florence but we were only going to have 45 min on our connection home. We had to go all away across the airport take multiple flights of stairs and then take a tram to get to our next gate as well as wait in line to pass through customs. Having the extra time between flights is a must at Zurich. Our flight home was the breaking point though. We flew out of Rome to head home and the flight was already listed as 10 min later when we got there. Then as the time got closer it definitely looked like it was going to be delayed even more. No word from Swiss Air though. We just kept seeing the departure times getting moved back. Finally we were called to board. One guy taking tickets and answering questions so by the time we got through that and took the shuttle buses to the plane to depart it was an hour late to take off. So we would be landing in Zurich at the time our plane to Boston would be leaving. No reason given for the delay. They said they would give us an update on the connecting flights 15 min before we landed. We were just told to go to a transfer desk when we got there at that point. Then as soon as we landed I got a text that we missed our flight and would be leaving the following day now. We got to the transfer desk and only 1 person was working and the line was getting longer. We finally got our boarding passes for the next day but were then told to go to another transfer desk where we just got off the plane to get our hotel transfer. At that point we were resigned to the fact we would be staying the night in Zurich so we decided to make the best of it. But not the case. We were given a taxi voucher for a hotel that was an hour away!! Apparently every hotel in the Zurich area was booked. By the time we left that airport and got to the hotel it had been 3 hours since we got off the plane. We were tired and hungry. We planned to just check in and go to the hotel restaurant to eat when we got there. We had a voucher for dinner there. Alas we get there to check in and are told they don't have a restaurant at the hotel!! Only snacks at the bar. The hotel was like staying in a hostel as well. Luckily on our next day everything went ok. Flights were always late that we took and we didn't have the smoothest landings on a couple of our flights. I would never fly Swiss again. If you have the option to fly Swiss with connections in Zurich I would think twice.,September 2018,"September 27, 2018",1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0

Disappointing. Advertising?,Zurich,Athens,Europe,"Flying SWISS to Athens and back was disappointing. This was on the tail end and at the beginning of our trip to Athens from Brisbane Australia. We had been flying Singapore Airlines until this point of our trip.

We were on the 777-300ER and then the a320 on the return flight. 

The first flight, on the 777 we found the cabin to be far too hot. Additionally the seat was average, and although the IFE was relatively new, there was no remote. No remote is really not the end of the world, however after take off there were numerous ads played, the ad sequence lasted for around 15-20 minutes, and felt like a bad joke.

The food onboard was somewhat decent for a short flight, the meal was tasty, hot and filled the gap. 

The a320 on the return flight was much the same with the advertising.

Legroom on both aircraft was about average, tight but not unbearable. 

The staff were ok, I know that someone travelling with us had a negative experience but overall the staff were also not too bad. 

All in all, SWISS is not great. The advertising is awful, and everything else is about average, though the food was good. As SWISS is the only European airline, aside from Ryanair that I‚Äôve flown I can‚Äôt recommend much else, though what I can say is think twice about flying SWISS, as there‚Äôs quite possibly something better.",April 2018,"September 26, 2018",3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,,,,

Great care to passenger struggling with ear problems,Zurich,Chicago,International,"We had over 10 hour flight due to head winds and had great service. Business class had 4 flight attendants taking care of us. I had a head cold and struggled equalizing my ears. They brought me medicine to use, hot water and lemon and checked on me regularly in addition to their normal duties. They were amazing even though English was not their first language. Business class seats had a variety of positions including completely flat. I think anyone over 5' 10"" would struggle to lie down. Each seat had it's own screen and large selection of older movies and TV shows. The headsets they supplied were very uncomfortable for such a long flight. We tried just our normal head phones and although they only had one plug they worked and sound was much better and more comfortable. Food was decent, loved the ice cream snack. Seats had built in massagers, foot rest that raised, etc. Still 10 hours was a very long time!!

On the flip side, we flew from Venice to Zurich in business class to connect to this flight. Business class was non existent. They just left the middle seat open. No extra leg room, no extra seat room, but did get free drinks.

* Always great In-Flight Entertainment, the largest screens I've seen in a Economy cabin
* Always I get very relaxed atmosphere during the flight, even if there are small children (they give them toys and such)
* Legroom is definitely bigger comparing to other airlines I've been
* Also the last seats in the end are actually very good and not worse than seats more to the front. No smell or noise of toilet since it's designed to be opened in the real back, not on the side.

Sustaining passenger through the ordeal of a long flight,Tokyo,Zurich,International,"With strong headwinds it took Swiss 12 hours and 20 minutes to get me from Tokyo to Zurich.

Unfortunately, my attempt to get an upgrade to First at check in failed. I had the two e-vouchers but they are not valid if you have purchased your ticket through an other, code-sharing airline (in this case ANA).
 My only criticism is about the plane used for this route, the A340.

In fact from start to finish Swiss International have been probably the worst customer service we have ever experienced.

This had us arriving a day late meaning we had to pay for a night in a hotel that we didn't use and reschedule an airport pickup. It also threw our child's sleeping pattern off by a lot more as we had planned the original flights to reduce the impact as much as possible. 
Despite all of this Swiss Airlines have been non communicative and after months of trying to get compensation for this we eventually for a form letter with a pittance of an $80 travel voucher offer for flights that totaled more than $1000 each.

The one disadvantage is that if you're in a side section, crossing over the aisle seat is difficult when it's being used so beware of getting window seats. Swiss International (business class) was so much better than other international flights I've had.  The Business class stewards were absolutely super polite and friendly.  The food was superb.  Went with the Filet Mignon and a good Cabernet.  Excellent wine choices and meal selections.  Deserts were artistic and good.  The bathroom was huge and super clean, I could have easily used it as a changing room.",September 2018,"September 23, 2018",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0
Very disappointed,Newark,Zurich,International,"Very unhappy with my recent transatlantic trip on Swiss, and frankly I expected much better based on good past experiences. I believe these were the most closely packed seats I had ever experienced, and on an overnight flight a bit of comfort is very important. My wife and I are smaller than average people, yet when trying to recline our legs were in contact with the reclined seat in front of us, and we could not easily move at all - little possibility of sleep. We had an ongoing seating issue for over 2 months - I understood that it was a complication that my ticket was purchased by my company's agency and my wife's was a personal purchase, but months in advance I tried to ensure that we could sit together, even at added cost. Full details would be too complicated, but in 3 separate series of communications, I was assured that we would have seats together, then sometime later I'd notice on the website that this was no longer the case, and we had separate or unreserved seats, and would start a new series of phone calls. Combining the reservations seemed not possible. In one case a representative told me that their notes said that I had agreed in a previous call to the understanding that our seats might not be together! - nothing could be further from the truth, I had always made clear that this was my highest priority, so that anyone who wrote otherwise was either being dishonest or their communication skills were too weak to be on a US customer service line. Again, the full story is very complex, but my short summary is that I do not plan to fly Swiss again.",September 2018,"September 23, 2018",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0

Plenty of space, service and comfort on Singapore airlines flight but for a tall person, the small space to put your feet when you lie down is not the best. In addition, you lie at an angle.

Punctuality with Swiss is much better.
Two negative points :

So we waited from 5PM, to 1AM in a queue, to get rescheduled. They brought us one bottle of water in that time, that's it. By 1AM, I was offered a dinner voucher, that turned out to be worthless because no restaurant or hotel served dinner at the time.

Amazing service,Dublin,Sao Paulo,International,"Flying to Sao Paulo from Dublin, with a stop in Zurich, on Business Class, was a great experience, specially for the service provided onboard both flights, very efficient and polite. One negative aspect of that trip (that is not related to Swiss directly) was the awful service offered at the Business Lounge of Dublin Airport Terminal 1 - cramped, with below minimums offer of food, all self-service coffee machines not working, forcing you to be served by a lady in not the best of moods, complemented by mini-croissants that were at least 24 hours old.
All the opposite from the Business Class Lounge on Terminal E from Zurich airport, spacious, with many options of food and amenities, great spaces to work with all privacy. Clean, tidy and well served toilets. Very swiss indeed. 
I took a so-called crown seat for my journey from Zurich to Sao Paulo, and the only sort of negative comment is the extremely cramped leg space when your seat is in bed position. One cannot turn while sleeping without waking up. It¬¥s Ok for people under 1.80m tall, but for me was a little bit squeezed.

On the BHX to ZUR route a delightful but cold croissant comes on the early flight which is ok when dunked in coffee. Evening flight comes with choice of small filled roll either cheese or, for the first time, spinach (!) Not being Popeye had the cheese. Swiss are as good as anyone in making up delays whenever possible and often succeed very well. Main reason for us using Swiss however is that they offer no-change BHX to ZUR. Only minor irritation is that although you can pre-book a seat they very often send an email saying that for ""operational reasons"", whatever they are, your seats have been changed. So when you get this immediately go in and see if the new seats are ok and if not re-allocate if possible.",September 2018,"September 19, 2018",4.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0
"Don't spend the extra $100 to get ""extra leg room"" seating.",Chicago,Amsterdam,International,"I had the extra dollars ($100, to be exact) to spend to have ""extra leg room"" on this flight.  The seat was in the exit door row, stating ""window seat"".  Yes, this seat did provide extra ""leg room"".  However, there is no ""window"" & ""seat"" is a stretch of the imagination.  The 3 seats in this row are very narrow with the food table tray & the video monitor stored in the armrest.  Thus, the armrests do not fold down, providing extra ""seat"" space for a bigger booty!
     The person who purchased the middle seat in this row did not fit at all. Fortunately, they were able to accommodate this person in a different row. I cannot imagine what the flight would have been like for we three who paid extra for these seats.
     Myself & the passenger on the aisle spent the rest of the flight laughing at other passengers trying to get thru the pulled curtain on their way to the toilet.  Too funny.  That's the other thing you have to put up with. The extra leg room quickly disappears as people form a cluster line waiting for the toilet.  Our Mantra for this flight was ""We Paid To Do This!""
     Here is the last issue to know before you pay extra for this seat, you cannot have your carry-on with you in this space.  So, if you are like me & have snacks, earplugs, books, etc. in your bag, you are up & down getting to your bag in a crowded overhead bin.

Hard to understand what can motivate such random seat arrangement, but the short of it is that the arrangements are not properly disclosed to custumers upon purchse or even at check in, so buyer beware of the short straw.

"On night flight (red-eye), was woken up by flight attendant and made to bring seat upright so passenger behind could eat",Dar es Salaam,Zurich,International,"My wife and myself were flying from Dar es Salaam, Tanzania to Zurich on an overnight flight and my wife was in a window seat. We were in economy but had paid extra to be moved forward to get additional legroom. The flight left Dar at 10:30pm and after the seat belt sign turned off my wife reclined her seat to sleep and was sound asleep when the food service commenced.
Obviously she did not take/get the food service, since she was asleep, but as the attendants were serving the passengers behind us, they came back to our row and woke my wife up and insisted that she raise her seat upright so the passenger behind her would have more room to eat.
We asked if there was a safety issue and why did they have to wake her up.  The flight attendant was very rude and insisted my wife had to raise her seat up for a courtesy to the other passenger, no matter what.  So my wife did, but then asked for her meal since she was awake now and was told that she would have to wait since the meal service had passed her and was serving other people further back.
She finally got her meal, but all of a sudden the head flight attendant/purser arrived at our row, asking if she was going to have a problem with us and again insisted my wife raise and keep her seat upright for the passenger comfort behind her. To say I was flabbergasted (since I travel a lot and have never seen this before) would be an understatement, but then the head purser threatened us before leaving saying I better not have to come back here again to deal with this or then we will have a real problem!",August 2018,"September 18, 2018",1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

Long haul flight was comfortable, seat pitch was fine, and the cabin had a sleepy effect on my partner and I; we dozed off midway through our movie when they dimmed the lights. The 3-4 kids seated around us seemed to have knocked-out too (Yay!) Our only complain was that the cabin temperature was a bit warm on our flight to Zurich, but it was nice and cold on our return journey, when we wore shorts instead. In-flight entertainment selection was good, but be prepared for a VERY lengthy promo video with lots of ads on your flight out of Zurich, its main hub. They gave out a small menu card before supper so we knew our options and what would be served for breakfast - nice. Food service is quite speedy and the attendants are generally friendly and helpful with additional drinks requests. After food services (ie after they clear the trays), they provide bottled water & some fruits in the galley for passengers to help themselves - I liked this as I didn't have to bother anyone. On arrival, it was a huge joy and relief when our bags came out first as we had transited at 2 airports and were very worried if our baggage may be lost; we were on 3 different flights & airlines before reaching our destination.

Now, I am overweight, but not so huge that I can't normally put the table down so I was not best pleased. it was the sort of thing you would expect from a penny-pinching budget airline, not Swiss! Time to take a few rows out and create better space. 
Another thing was that on the outward flight we were changed from the 2 seats we had booked in advance to a row further back without any proper explanation. We later realised that our original seats were by an exit door and there must be a policy of not allowing people of a certain age to sit there (we are both 60 plus). If so, why not say so?

When he tried to sit we noticed that for his legs to fit he had to open his legs and place his knees in an angle in between seats. As the trip was going to take 12 hours, we pledged to the crew to help us find him another place. We even offered to pay for an upgrade, as traveling like that would be excruciating. The promptly said that the plane was full and there was nothing they could do about it.
He is still limping today from the pain caused to his knees by those tight seats.

The Most Stressful Experience EVER!!!!!!!,London,Seville,Europe,"We booked flights in February for an upcoming trip in October to Seville. The Swiss Air flight is from London Heathrow to Zurich then Edelweiss Air (owned by Swiss Air) from Zurich to Seville. 
When filling in our APPI details (luckily 5 weeks before flying), I noticed our LHR departure time had changed from 8.50am to 6.00am with no notification! Rang Swiss Air to find out why this has happened, we have yet to receive an answer to this question. We were told we'd been informed by e-mail of the changes only to find they have the wrong e-mail address, we gave them the correct one as we received e-mails from them however someone has input a 1 instead of a T into the address.

"friendly service, relatively old equipment, biz class at best ""ok""",Zurich,Mumbai,International,"Aircraft in use for this flight was an A330. You could see and feel that it was a bit of an older type - the upholstery in the business class was a bit worn out, the screen of the entertainment system was really small. 

Sleeping comfort in Business Class: limited, at best ""ok"". If you have a window seat, you need to climb over the person next to you - probably sleeping. The ""bed"" is relatively small and - despite a massage function built into the seat - you wake up with back pain the next morning. 
Yes, you can stretch out your legs, but they fold underneath the seat in front of you and the space there - particularly for your feet - becomes cramped. 

Flight was punctual. 
Entertainment: screens are too small, a few more documentaries would have been nice - but ok. 

Service on the other hand was really great - authentically friendly people, very agile, very focussed on service.",September 2018,"September 15, 2018",3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0
Comfortable and efficient Business Class flight,Heraklion,Canton of Geneva,Europe,"To get a flight from Crete to Madrid at a reasonable hour during the day was tricky. The best option was Swiss from Heraklion to Geneva, and then on to Madrid. We flew in Swiss' new Bombardier C-series aircraft, and it was nice and new and clean, and the service was friendly and efficient. The seating is 3+2, with the same seats in Business and Economy. But in Business you get 1 of 2 or 2 of 3, so you get the extra room and more legroom. However, pack a book and put some music on your phone because there's zero in-flight entertainment - just some really small screens in the roof showing the flight path. Didn't worry me as the flight was relatively short, and anyway I had a heap of classical music on my phone.
For the transfer at Geneva we went into the Business lounge - nice and clean, with lots of drinks and some hot food as well. And, as would you expect from the Swiss, the toilets were scrupulously clean!",September 2018,"September 15, 2018",5.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0
Our best yet Business class experience,Zurich,Singapore,International,"My wife and I  have flown Swiss in Business class on 4 occasions now, most recently, last June flying from Rome via Zurich to Singapore.

The experience on each occasion was outstanding.

The Swiss Business class lounge at Zurich airport is excellent.  It's spacious, with 
 comfortable areas for work as well as relaxation and has great views from its large windows.  There is also an outside balcony area overlooking the runways and the mountains beyond,

Food selection is excellent and can sometimes even include a steak cooked to order.

Drinks include just about anything you might want.

On board service from the Swiss cabin crew was impeccable from start to finish.  Food was excellent  and the lay  flat seats were very comfortable.

There were also plenty of options to amuse yourself with from the entertainment system, although I found the music menu limited.

Deciding to fly Business class means that you'll be paying several times more than an  Economy class ticket, so you expect certain things in return for the premium fare you have paid.

You expect access to a good quality lounge in the airport, preferential check in,  boarding and disembarkation, comfortable seating on board , good in-flight service and food.

We definitely felt that we got all of those things and then some flying Business class with Swiss.

Their staff laughed in our faces after we told them how we waited for several hours in a line.

A pleasant surprise,Singapore,Zurich,International,"I was a apprehensive about this flight having read previous reviews. My travel agent had asked me to select my seat when booking and pointed out that certain seats marked with a cross required an extra payment. She had never seen that with any airline in business class. I was interested to see why the extra charge was required. It turned out that it was a single seat but rather than it being a wide seat it was exactly the same size as my seat despite taking up the same space as the two seats. You had a console on either side. Definitely not worth the additional cost. As it turned out I didn‚Äôt have a passenger beside me so no issue getting out at any time. 

The service was very good and the food was well presented. The flight took off and landed on time which was great as I only has 50 minutes to my next flight.",September 2018,"September 12, 2018",5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,

Zero Client Orientation,Sao Paulo,Zurich,International,"Swiss lacks more and more Client Orientation. If everything goes well, it can be a nice experience (see also my previous report on a recent flight), but as soon as there is an issue you will experience a ""service desert"". A mistake was made on my arrival which I understand can happen. What is unacceptable is the way they dealt with it. First they wanted to tell me I made a mistake, then they told me to be more friendly otherwise they would not speak to me (I was not rude but just nervous), and finally they said everybody can make a mistake and I should not make such a fuss....instead of a small excuse this is the way they treat their premium customers. I also realized they treat their staff very nicely, greet them etc, but ignore you as a frequent flyer and first class passenger. It is a pity, as it could be a good airline, but with this attitude they will lose more and more customers.

Flying with Swiss International,Barcelona,Zurich,Europe,"I flew four times with Swiss in September 2018, and I have mixed feelings towards Swiss International Air Lines:
- service on-board was very good, and snacks were tasty - even in economy class
- communications from the staff / pilot were good, and all needed information were always provided
- three flights out of four departed late, and four flights out of four arrived late, and this was the worst flight: it was announced as leaving Barcelona 20 minutes late, but actually left 30 minutes late; it also arrived 30 minutes late in Zurich, and it made my connection there hard to keep - I had to rush from one end of the airport to the other.",September 2018,"September 12, 2018",3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0

Close to perfection from beginning to the end,Zurich,Sao Paulo,International,"What would be nicer than to start a vacation, travelling in Business Class? That's exactly what my good friend Paddy and me did last month. We enjoyed Business Class in the newest, most state-of-the-art aircraft that Swiss uses for their longhaul flights - its Triple-Seven. In fact, we were assigned seats in the very first row, just behind the First Class cabin. I am pretty well aware, that the reviews of this aircraft are mixed. Particularly bad ones for Economy-Class with 10 seats crammed in one row where premium airlines, such as Cathay Pacific or Thai Airways only seat 9. Also Economy offers way too little legroom for longhaul flights. Anyway, I should write about their Business-Class product. It is brilliant. Excellent seating arrangement, space, Innovation to detail and comfort which makes a long journey simply short. The crew, mainly male attendants, were extremely friendly and helpful. They even addressed us by our names. The meals served were simply excellent (for airline food), in presentation and in quality. Only downer that partially disturbed my personal experience and that the crew did nothing about, was this bunch of three young Israeli men who forcedly talked so loud in the aisles, waking me up way too early, that I would have loved to ""silence"" them.",August 2018,"September 10, 2018",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
outdated entertainment system and no leg room,Zurich,Shanghai,International,"Living in Switzerland, the airline of choice should be Swiss. On transatlantic flights I try to avoid flying with Swiss because they do not have any economy comfort options like many of the US carriers and Air France and KLM. On this recent long haul flight I was reminded again just why - the entertainment system was very outdated and not even working at some seats, the legroom is an absolute disaster, and for people tall like myself, you can barely see the display because it can-t be rotated out enough to watch from the height of my head, and if the person in front reclines- forget it.",August 2018,"September 10, 2018",2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0

24h later I had everything back, but what was my surprise when I opened the stroller‚Äôs bag and realized that the stroller was broken, exactly the piece that make it to open and close. 
I called the lost baggage phone number and they gave me another phone, DOLFI1920‚Äôs phone, is the one who deal with the broken baggage. 
I told them how important is for me to have a stroller, I have a ONE YEAR OLD BABY, Who weights 13KG, and can‚Äôt barely walk. They told me to answer an email that they would send me and in 48h max. should be fixed, because they understand that the baby stroller is very important for us. 
I replied their email within 2h and next day they told me that I need a paper from Swiss airlines in which they gave their phone number. And that I also need to fill up the broken baggage form in Swiss airlines website. 
TWO DAYS ALREADY PASSED AND STILL WITHOUT STROLLER.

A bit disappointing beforehand,Zurich,Hong Kong,International,"We were a bit disappointed with the airline. We had booked a vegan meal beforehand, but were told at the departure gate that it had been applied to our first flight (Florence > Zurich), even though short-haul flights don't receive meals (and we didn't receive one on board either)! The staff member was smiley but seemed completely uninterested in helping us or suggesting something, simply telling us 'no, you won't have a meal'. This was extremely frustrating. On board, the staff were friendly and tried to cobble things together for us, but all we ended up eating on the 12-hour flight were bread rolls and fruit. 
As a side note about the plane, as it was fairly old, the legroom was appalling. My partner is 6""6 and is usually ok in economy seats, but these were so small, his knees were wedged against the chair in front, so we had to tell the woman sat in front that she wouldn't be able to recline.

They treated all passengers as they were offenders of a crime and had some pay 55 EUR as a penalty they said.

We explained that we are LH Senators/ UA 1Ks and never had this on any flight in the entire system. The station personell responded that we should shut up, or they call the Police on us. We had to calm them down even.

Up to now I would say I am a fan, 9 year frequent flier, the 777 in economy changes that, it is a truly horrible experience.

Zurich Transfers from out of Schengen area countries to out of Schengen area countries,Chicago,Moscow,International,"ZURICH AIRPORT TRANSFERS

The system in place for transit from arrivals from out of the Schengen area countries transiting to an out of a Schengen area country was the best we have experienced in Europe. We arrived from the USA (Chicago-O'Hare) on our way to the Russian Federation (Moscow). We only had to go through one security check and at the departure gate we had one document check(Passport and Visa) and did not have to go through multiple passport control checks and multiple security checks as we have experienced in Frankfort airport during transit from out of Schengen area countries to out of Schengen area countries.

Arriving at a Concourse E gate you are quickly directed via clearly marked signage to a shuttle train that moves you to the point in terminal building 1 that had connections with B gates. Our total transit time from arriving at gate E19 to gate B32 only took a total of 55 minutes. I had been concerned with only having 120 minutes between flights at Zurich Airport since we have experienced 3-4 hour transit times when flying through Frankfort airport with the same itinerary.

First and possibly Last time I will travel with Swiss Airlines.,London,Antalya,Europe,"I travelled for our summer holidays to Turkey via Swiss Airlines. The first was to Zurich and then a connecting flight with Edelweiss to Turkey. Both planes didn‚Äôt have inbuilt TV screens but room space on both was sufficient for a simple plane. Food on both planes were quite insufficient and lacked in portion size. The first plane provides travellers with a hard cold croissant (tasted as if it was defrosted) and the other provided cold cuts of meat with some pickle potatoes and green beans with a small chocolate moose. There was no vegetarian options for those that had dietary requirements (Halal) and were told they had to have requested this upon check in. We were unable to check in online but to have no veg options is quite disappointing. My flight in particular ....... had so many passengers complain as veg options were requested via online check in and yet undelivered in service. This is not only inconvenient but not acceptable. Staff tried their best to deal with the situation by offering lots of bread but couldn‚Äôt and didn‚Äôt have the facilities to offer any other alternatives. They dealt with the issues in a adequate manner and this therefore raises concern on behalf of the airline which needs to step the bar up if they wish to have any further bookings from customers including myself. Travelling to a Muslim country where the possibilities of Halal is a requirement and not providing vegetarian options as an alternative for the non delivery of this is just plain stupidity. 

Another note is that Switzerland airport is very limited especially if you have a long transit period. There is one cafe that serves hot food and is very expensive; 25 Euro for a burger. There around two convenient stores to buy some drinks and light snacks.

The inflight entertainment can be improved. The selection of movies are not the latest.The flight takes around 12 hours. It will be an upper hand if the airline will invest in the latest movie to let either family or business traveler to catch up on movies during the long flights.

In terms of punctuality, the flight was slightly delayed due to runway congestion at Changi airport. We were glad that our baggage arrived at the destination in good condition.

Not trhe best communication and experience,Boston,Rome,International,"Well we first dealt with bad weather effecting our departure, and Swiss Air changing us to another airline Delta. So as we were waiting for our plane in Boston and when our plane taxi into the gate it clipped the wing of another plane. So they flew another plane for Detroit to Boston to get us over to a connection in Amsterdam to Rome. We did it, but had to run with our luggage through customs to barely catch our flight. Also Delta would not give us assigned seats for the connection because it was with Royal Dutch, so that delayed us too. Not a pleasant flight, and it took a lot longer than originally scheduled.

Then on our return we had trouble checking in on-line, so we tried the Swiss Air Italy number and that kept connecting us to a private number. So we tried the Boston Swiss Air number and after getting through they were extremely helpful and checked us in. When we arrive three hours at the airport the next day we went to get our boarding passes from Swiss Air and we were told we hadn't checked in yet. The woman checking us in was extremely rude and while she was helping us check in she was in a very loud and angry conversation in a lovers spat. She most likely figured since we were american and speaking english with her we wouldn't be able to understand her conversation in Italy. Not the case! 

Long story short, not only was she one of the most upsetting service people that I ever have the unfortunate opportunity to deal with, but on our flight from Rome to Zurich she seated my wife in row 4 and me in back of the plane in row 38. So there was huge delay in meeting up with my wife to run to our next flight. Plus there was a 30 minute delay boarding and then we had to wait for a gate in Zurich. We barely made the plane, but the good thing that happen was two very nice people moved to our our separate seats and offered us their seats. I guess the karma needed to change, and Swiss Air was definitely not offering it. Just those two good souls who offered us their seats, so we could sit together.

Oh by the way, the Swiss plane was old and didn't have the wifi capability to purchase.

Manchester to Tell Aviv madness,Manchester,Tel Aviv,International,"I travelled with Swiss on 27th of February from Manchester to Tel Aviv via Zurich.

I was originally supposed to catch the 10.45pm flight from ZRH to TLV. But due to the late arrival of the flight from Manchester(10.43pm), I was informed that I would only be able to travel to TLV the following morning.

Upon arrival in ZRH, I was informed that I would not be able to leave the airport and I was therefore shown to a room within the airport. The room can only be described as marginally better than a prison cell. It was extremely small, had no open able window and was hot, stuffy with no A/C or other ventilation.

The corridor in which the room was located was likewise small and was subsequently locked  for the night.

There was one public toilet and shower in the corridor, with no personal toiletries provided. When I requested deodorant in the morning I was given a used can that had to be returned after use.

I was given a voucher to buy food, but there were  no open shops at that hour.

I was unable to contact my family in England as there were no telephones provided in the locked corridor in which I was ‚Äòimprisoned‚Äô.

On the flight to TLV the following morning, I received a seat towards the back of the plane. I had reserved myself an Exit seat on the original flight to TLV. In consideration of the fact that I am 6ft 2in tall being denied the Exit seat I had originally booked caused major discomfort.

Poor long-haul experience,Zurich,Tokyo,International,"We just had quite a poor long haul service experience with Swiss. The problems started when we checked in online and realised that our family of four (including two young children) were not seated together. When we got to the airport we were told that the flight was over booked and there‚Äôs nothing I could do. Same we got to the gate. We then tried to negotiate with individual passages that couldn‚Äôt make it work so we were left with threes groups of seats for the two adults and a nine-year-old and three-year-old girl. Needless to say this made the (overnight) flight very difficult for us all, and Swiss didn‚Äôt seem overly concerned to help us. Now I didn‚Äôt not even think seating children away from their parents was legal and most airlines pre-seat families in groups to make sure this doesn‚Äôt happen but it would seem Swiss is more interested in making short-term money by overbooking the plane. In the 40 overnight long haul flights I‚Äôve taken with the kids this is never happened to me before so I‚Äôm very disappointed with Swiss. To make matters worse they then served me an inedible dish again didn‚Äôt seem too concerned by that.

Best regional flight in 13 years of travelling in Europe,London,Florence,Europe,"We've flown EasyJet, KLM, Air France, Lufthansa, British Airways and an obscure Belgian airline but Swiss wins hands down.  In fairness, KLM comes a close second.  What we found with Swiss is that they are good value for money, the standard package is more than sufficient, they are more reliable than the budget airlines, there are no hidden costs and the aeroplanes are clean and modern.  I was also very impressed by their awareness of diversity and inclusion - both BME and gender, in the cockpit and in the cabin.  Our outward trip was a shambles with delays at Heathrow and the associated knock-on effects but the crew went out of their way to be friendly and helpful.  The big surprise on the way back was when I asked for gluten-free snacks.  I was offered a chocolate muffin on the first leg and it wasn't bad at all and a quinoa salad on the second leg that was frankly delicious.  Anyone who is restricted to a gluten-free diet will know the perils involved and I was astonished and so impressed by what I was offered as well as the smile that accompanied it.  I was also impressed by the cabin staff who were able to effectively handle a very rude young punk who demanded booze before take-off.

Very little leg space and poor service,Brussels,Denpasar,International,"This year we flew with this airlines from Brussels to Denpasar (flight from singapore to Denpasar carried out by singapore airlines). In advance we booked chairs next to each other (a paid service). By boarding we found out that the chairs where very small (we're average height and weight). When sitting down your knees almost hit the chair in front of you. When the person in front of you is putting the chair in sleep mode then it's even worse. This makes its almost impossible to have a meal. During flight (night time) there is water and snacks available in the pantry, but with sleeping people besides you that's not very convenient. One's and a while there someone walking around with water. For the return flight we tried to chance our reserved chairs to chairs with extra leg space. (Started to email as soon as we arrived). After several emails (where they asked me to call the service centre, which is very expensive from bali) we received a email with the following solution. We could cancel the first reservation for chairs (next to each other) and make a new one for extra leg space. We would be charged for the full cost, the paid amount for the first reservation was not refundable. Conclusion: never ever again are we gone fly Swiss air. Very bad service for changing of reservations and horrible seating.",,"August 26, 2018",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,

"It's not a matter of the airline, it's the matter of their ground handling staff",Cairo,Stuttgart,International,"Swiss/Austrian/Lufthansa, you should either chose another ground handler or train the current one(s) at CAI airport. Two recent experiences are not in favor of the airline(s). When checkin in mid July with my wife, the agent informed us that the flight is heavily booked and he would accept our hand-luggage to be checked in free of charge. We re-arranged our stuff and noticed, that the trolley we wanted to check in would be more or less ""empty"". So we reconsidered, repacked and took our 2 trolleys along to the aircraft. The aircraft was NOT full, more than 20 (!) seats been empty. During this ""event"" my mobile phone got lost and despite filing the issue at the airport police there was no result.
Checking-in on another flight on 17.08. this agent was more than relaxed, actually he was ""hanging"" in his chair, not sitting. He did not say one single word (maybe due to the fact that he had been talking too much privately on his mobile phone).  My wish to be seated to the front of the aircraft in a seat either at the window or the aisle ended like: Sitting in a middle seat in the very last row of the aircrat from CAI to ZRH and from ZRH to FRA again a seat in the last row. No, i was not one of the last passengers checking in, according to the numbered forms for immigration, i was passenger 28 checking in.

The ONLY negative...

All seats have a TV screen with a great selection of movies to watch. 1 hour in to an 8 hour flight, not all screens were working, so the system needed to be rebooted. 1 hour later, it still wasn‚Äôt working. 2 hours later, the TVs started working. Very important to a long flight.

Horrible first experience,Boston,Zurich,International,"My wife and I traveled to Switzerland for 3 weeks for our honeymoon. The first flight from Boston to Zurich was between 8-10 hours. The connecting flight from Zurich to Geneva was under 1 hour.

My original impression with Swiss Air wasn't good, but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary based on my experience with American or United. I originally overlooked this (and wasn't going to write a review) but our return trip was so excruciatingly bad that I now find it necessary to inform the public of each and every aspect of how poor our entire experience was and how badly Swiss Air handled the situation.

During our trip to Zurich, the service on the plane from Boston to Zurich was simply not friendly. This was surprising to us given all of the glowing online reviews of the airline. More importantly (especially for an 8+ hour flight), we were on an extremely old plane without even the simplest of present day commodities (no outlets or USB ports to charge our phones). Some might not think it's fair to write a review based on the fleet of the airline, but I believe that's absolutely something that reflects on the airline.

On our return flight after a wonderful 3 weeks in Switzerland, we had a nightmarish experience with Swiss Air. We ordered our tickets through the Swiss Air website which included a connection from Geneva to Zurich before flying from Zurich to Boston. Due to weather issues, our flight from Geneva to Zurich was unable to land on time and we circled the airport until the weather was more appropriate for us to land. Let me be the first to say that I am perfectly understanding of issues like this. I would rather be safe on my flight and weather is certainly a common factor that jeopardizes that. However, the way the airline handles the situation afterwards, in my honest opinion, is what makes or breaks the airline. In this case, Swiss Air failed miserably. Prior to landing in Zurich (around 5:00 PM), the Swiss Air flight made an announcement regarding the connections. We were told on the flight that we needed to make our way immediately to our gate (as our flight was departing at 5:30). Our plane landed and we deboarded at 5:22 PM, giving us 8 minutes to get to our gate. Upon deboarding, there was literally nobody working for the airport or Swiss Air within eye shot to inform we were on our way. Because of that, we began running from gate A22 and needed to get to gate E23 in 8 minutes. Due to airport logistics, we needed to traverse numerous escalators as well as take a tram. We arrived at the gate at 5:33 and our flight was still sitting outside, though the gate had been closed. Thus, we could see our flight but were unable to board. The fact that Swiss Air didn't recognize there were 2 guests late due to a connecting Swiss Air flight and didn't hold the gate open for even just a few minutes was astonishing to us. We spoke with a Swiss Air representative and they told us that there was nothing they could do and that we would need to get in the transfer line to obtain more information. We stood for about 30 minutes in a transfer line in terminal E behind a couple of other folks with the same issue as us. After getting to the front of the line, we were told we would need to go to the transfer line in terminal A for any issues with connecting flights. Again, we waited 30 minutes for absolutely nothing due to poor guidance. We walked the 10 minutes to terminal A and then saw the size of the transfer line. After being in line for about 30 minutes, I started a timer on my phone. At this point there were hundreds of people in line and only a single station was open for economy flights. We were in line for another hour and a half before we were able to talk to someone. It was now about 8:30 PM when they told us they would get us a hotel for the night with free transportation and vouchers for dinner since there were no earlier flights to Boston. I will admit that the hotel was actually nice (once we actually got there). When I looked online, a standard room was booking that evening for about $198. I'm sure it costs Swiss Air a lot less with their bulk discount, but it was still better than most. However, actually getting to the hotel was another process in and of itself. I had originally expected that ""transportation to the hotel"" would have been a taxi for my wife and I, but it was actually a shuttle service which was another line we needed to wait in. Actually, this line was more of a mob without any organization. The driver arrived and first went to a different hotel. When he returned about 15 minutes later, there were even more people pushing and trying to get to the front of the mob so they didn't need to wait. Again, this shuttle service probably has reviews of their own, but the fact that Swiss Air is utilizing them just continues to reflect poorly on them as well as the process that we needed to go through to get to the hotel. Once we were finally able to get to the airport it was about 10:00 PM. While we were told that the ""dinner vouchers"" were a $20 voucher for dinner, they were actually for a buffet that was setup at the hotel which we believe was exclusively for the airline due to so many issues. While the dinner was decent, we had expected to actually be able to buy our own dinner (although lets be realistic, 20 CHF per person gets you a salad in Switzerland). All that being said, our entire day was wasted and we didn't even get to enjoy a day in Zurich because of how long the process took.

In the morning, our flight to Boston was 12:55 PM. Everything was mostly seamless from the hotel to the airport. We got checked in with Swiss Air and waited at our gate. I spoke with the gate attendant to try and get our seats upgraded on the 9 hour flight, but they kindly informed me that this flight was ""full"" and that there were no available upgrades. When we eventually boarded the plane, we at least had USB ports for phone charging, but my wife was amazed at even how old this plane was. She has flown on numerous international flights with Qatar Air, Emirates, AirAsia, and even other local flights to Hawaii, and she was simply confused (maybe based on our experience in Switzerland and how nice the trains are) why they were using such old planes for international flights. According to her, every international flight she has been on has been ""really nice"". She didn't have the same kind things to say about Swiss Air. Unfortunately I wish I could stop my review here, but there's just one more item worth noting. Our flight didn't leave on time because we were waiting for a late couple to board the plane. This was simply the icing on the cake because Swiss Air couldn't wait 3 minutes for us the day before and yet here we are at 1:04 PM on a flight scheduled to depart at 12:55 and now we're sitting here waiting for a couple? Because of the fact that we needed to wait for the couple, our flight was then delayed further since we needed to get back in the taxi queue at the airport. Just ridiculous.

All that being said, we expected a whole lot more out of Swiss Air. I can safely say that we will never willingly choose to fly with them again. We specifically chose them due to their online reviews, but I feel it necessary to inform the public of how bad our experience was with them to allow others to make educated decisions moving forward. A hotel room for a few hours with a buffet dinner is hardly worth the fact that we lost an entire vacation day the next day. We really would have expected at least a class upgrade on the next flight, but even that wasn't something they were willing to do. I would avoid Swiss Air at all costs for international flights unless you enjoy antiquated planes and have no connecting flights.",August 2018,"August 19, 2018",1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0

Business class from Geneva to Malaga is a disgrace,Canton of Geneva,Malaga,Europe,"Swiss used to offer great service in business class and still do IF you travel out of Zurich. One wonders why customers traveling from Geneva do not receive the same standard of service - are they not as important? Is Swiss trying to lose its customer base from Geneva? If so, you are doing a great job; Easyjet will no doubt be happy.
Meal offer is the same as in Economy except that everything is free and customers in business class are offered a hot dish, which is now is served without a tray. 
The cabin staff is friendly and the aircraft itself is very clean, but this is something that should be a given from an airline like Swiss!
It's the lack of that ""little bit extra"", which is still being provided when flying out of or to Zurich, that I find so appalling.

WORST AIRLINE EVER!! If you plan on eventually leaving your destination - do NOT use them.,Zurich,Johannesburg,International,"PS NO RESPONSE FROM AIR SWISS YET - will gladly update if any response is received 

Upon arrival in Zurich we ran to the gate for our next flight LX288 to Johannesburg only to find that this was delayed by 1 hour. We then waited until 00:00 until boarding commenced. We then boarded the plane settling into our seats. The plane was extremely hot, upon our request for air conditioning we were told that it is broken at this point. At 1:30 we were asked to disembark the plane as the flight had been cancelled. We had to wait for the business class and first class passengers to disembark first and remain in the uncomfortably hot aircraft. Once we got off the plane we were given a plastic / disposal blanket and a toothbrush with no toothpaste and told to find a corner in the airport as they do not have hotels. How is it possible to cancel a flight and expect paying customers to sleep on the floor. We were told the flight would be rescheduled for 9am the next morning. 

We returned to the boarding gate at 8am after minimal sleep on 4 July 2018 to board our plane to Johannesburg. We boarded the plane at the proposed time, however we were delayed by 45 minutes we were not informed why the plane was delayed. After roughly 1 hour and 30 minutes in flight the pilot announced on the PA system that the aircraft air was contaminated and that he had no choice but to return to Z√ºrich. We then returned to Z√ºrich. Before landing he pilot informed us that he had to circle a few times first and engage the landing gear early as to burn off fuel as we are too heavy to land and will have no breaks upon landing if the plane doesn‚Äôt burn off the fuel. Upon landing we were taken to a Hard-stand safety/emergency area where a bus was waiting the plane was surrounded by emergency personal airing out the breaks. This was terrible and traumatic  as we were watching the emergency staff such as fire man and police trying to cool down the planes brakes. Other passengers were shouting and screaming because they were exhausted, angry and frustrated. This was even more traumatic to us! We then got into the bus and returned to the terminal building. We then continued to wait for 3.5 hours to get a new ticket to return home. This is after the second cancelled flight. 3.5 hours waiting in the terminal building with the poorest service I have ever experienced. We were then given a flight get from Zurich to Munich to Johannesburg scheduled for 5 July 2018. Upon arriving at the airport we went to the Swiss air help desk and they informed us that the flight we were added to was overbooked and they could not get us any seats unfortunately.

Economy felt luxurious,Basel,Berlin,Europe,"I can count on Swiss to provide service, during the flight you receive little snacks and chocolates, which make the time spent relaxing. However because the airport is small, if you arrive 2 hours early you cannot check in before the flight in front of you.

‚Ä¢	Finally we are allowed to eat something after several trips through customs, security  checks and Airline office
‚Ä¢	At 18.00h the Airline lands, at the same time all passengers are requested to join the gate for an important information, Airline employees announces that the company has send a smaller plain and 48 passengers must stay in the city, the remaining will be sorted out to take the flight to Johannesburg. 
‚Ä¢	We were lucky, as our agency in Spain did arrange for us an option with KLM from Johannesburg to Amsterdam the same night, to continue to Zurich, but as we lost the connections we were oblige to stay overnight in Zurich, one person had to head to Rome ‚Äì to go to Malaga, the other on luckier as he could change his flight to the next day to Pereira via London.

‚Ä¢	No employee from Swiss, was able to arrange any hotel, nor any cover on first necessary hygiene items nor in Johannesburg, nor in Zurich. 
Claim Case no. 1807-LX-12684 is still open since over 30 days. After several correspondences to Swiss no answer, just a word saying that they passed the claim to their Sub contacted company South African Airlines, member of StarAlliance.

The claim is very well based: European Airlines have alliances, agreements within Europa and other the world. If you purchase a ticket with Swiss, Lufthansa MEMBER of STARALLIANCE, is the ORIGIN company in charge for delays, substitutions, claims, etc.

Most Incompetent Airline By Far,Phoenix,Amsterdam,International,"On a recent flight from Phoenix to Amsterdam my suitcase got left behind in San Francisco. That was four days ago. Due to severe storms in Amsterdam on Thursday my connecting flight got cancelled and I had to spend the night in Z√ºrich. When I went to retrieve my luggage I noticed that my suitcase was missing. I handed my claim tag to a Swissport agent and asked her to locate it for me. Her response was she couldn't do that, because Z√ºrich wasn't my final destination. She could only tell me that my luggage had not arrived in Z√ºrich. Since SWISS did not have a flight available for me to get to Amsterdam on Friday either, I was rerouted to Brussels where I finally filed a claim. This company is aware that I am leaving Amsterdam by train tomorrow morning. I have no faith they will manage to deliver it to me in Germany either. The customer service/support or lack thereof has been unacceptable. Forget trying to call them. So far I have only received a response when I posted on their FB page. Now I am allowed to purchase some necessities at my expense, submit the receipts, and they may reimburse me. Did you know the reimbursement amount for a passenger traveling in the economy class is at $100 versus $500 for first class? SWISS International Airline is part of a network of 28 airlines.

Now suddenly on my return flight my baggage is too big and I need to pay to check it in? Why would they let me leave my home country with it but have an excuse when I have no choice but to pay for it or leave it behind. It seems like a money making scheme to me.

Everything is decided for you,Zurich,Singapore,International,"Whilst I am sure the food provided in the Business Lounge is very healthy and well cooked by the chef, the range of food was very limited.  The airline has obviously decided that it will provide healthy food, but essentially it has limited he choice to pasta cooked by the chef, take it or leave it.  The lounge is best described as clinical, and as expected, everything works, but it lacked any feeling of comfort.   Zurich airport has an advantage as it is very convenient for the city and the cost of the train into the Hauptbahnhof is very reasonable at about Euro 3.60.  The journey only takes about 10minutes.  The flight was excellent and the crew could not do enough to help.  Also the food was well chosen.  Overall an excellent package, but a softer less clinical approach in the business lounge would, in my opinion, have made the experience better.",July 2018,"August 9, 2018",4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0
4 Long haul flights - all as bad as each other,New Delhi,Miami,International,"Recently had 4 flights with Swiss from India to the US and back.

The flights were all horrid.

Firstly, the IFE had not been calibrated on 2/4 of the flights so choosing anything became impossible.

The IFE screen would turn on automatically after 30 minutes or so, considering this was a night flight it meant the planes were constantly lit up.

When starting the flight they decide to play a 30 minute video about the airline and Zurich airport - this has bright white screens after every few minutes, again lighting up the whole cabin. It is also impossible to skip this, so you're unable to choose something to watch.

Food is mediocre - but didn't expect much else.

They served alcohol non-stop to people who quite clearly didn't need serving any further meaning my 2 legs from the US > India were full of noisy out of hand guests.

The attendant tried to get me to move from my aisle seat to a window even after I told him I was claustrophobic and hence had booked this exact seat.

The worst thing, they have removed 4 toilets from the back of Economy, which means you have hundreds of people sharing 4 toilets, on a long haul flight. It is disgusting.

Honestly there was loads of other stuff I should have done 4 individual 1* reviews.

Appalling,Zurich,Birmingham,Europe,"I went to Zermatt for a week with my 2 children.  On Thursday evening I received a text advising that our flight home the next afternoon had been cancelled.  I rang their call centre immediately & was rebooked on to a flight leaving 2.5 hours than my original flight.

Under Swiss‚Äôs published policy all 3 of us qualify for compensation as the rebooked flight left more than one hour before or original flight would have.  In addition, we were now going via Frankfurt and not direct. 

I completed the online claim form that Thursday evening and since then....silence.

I called a week later and was asked to wait until 10 days had passed.  Who takes 10 days to reply to a claim that meets your criteria??

I had still heard nothing after 10 days and so rang the number provided online.  The call handler today told me that the call centre cannot advise on compensation claims & that email is the only method.  I asked her to confirm the email I needed, she actually said that she did not know what it was & could only refer me back to the website.  It was like talking to a brick wall.

I have flown Swiss for over 25 years, 3 times in the last year.  Am I likely to fly them again?  The jury is very much out.

Swiss Air Business Class - good but not great,Newark,Johannesburg,International,"I booked a last minute rewards Business Class ticket through United to see family in Johannesburg. 
Check in at Newark was ok. If not a little rude. They failed to tell me I could use an expedited line for TSA. I eventually asked after seeing how long the line for security was! (Hint - if you don‚Äôt have priority - allow a lot of time for TSA)
The lounge was under construction and was small and crowded. The drink and food selection was decent but not extraordinary. Boarding, however was quite smooth. 

This was my first flight with Swiss and I was actually quite excited to try it‚Äôs Business class product on an A330. The seat itself is nice. I had a single seat on the side with direct aisle access. Similar to what I‚Äôve flown on Delta One, Asiana, Alitalia and ANA. A good product! 

The FA‚Äôs were polite and the service was good. The meal was decent and after watching a movie I reclined the chair into bed mode and grabbed a few hours sleep. At 6‚Äô2‚Äù sleeping on planes - even in Business Class is not always a guarantee! So I was happy to get some good rest on this plane. 
I woke to have breakfast and before I knew it, we had landed in Zurich. Deplaning was a breeze. 
This is where Swiss is really good. Zurich airport is awesome. Clean, modern, greatly styled and super easy to navigate. The new Swiss flagship lounge is so cool. Plenty of places to sit, dine and stretch out. I didn‚Äôt use the showers as I was going into Zurich for the day to a hotel - I had a 12 hour layover. 
Passport control and customs were efficient and I grabbed a cab and headed to Zurich for the day. Which was an awesome way to spend a 12 hour layover. 
The second leg of my journey to Johannesburg went equally smooth. I left though a different terminal. This lounge was not as nice - but still good. Boarding was easy. 
Once again the FA‚Äôs on this flight were really good. This time I was in an older A340 - which is a plane I quite like. But with the same retrofitted hard product. Another decent meal, followed by a good night‚Äôs sleep and I was in Johannesburg!

Deteriorating experience despite higher prices,Zurich,Boston,International,"I fly Swiss quite frequently (business and economy) because I am based in Zurich and the airline often simply offers the most convenient option to get nonstop from A to B.

However, I‚Äôm increasingly disappointed with the experience. 

Many of the airplanes need a cabin overhaul and on a few flights this year the decade-old entertainment system kept crashing.

Annoyingly, Swiss is increasingly copying pricing models of low-cost airlines despite being a normal, market-rate carrier. For example: on a recent trip Zurich to Boston I had to pay USD 35 (one way) to reserve a seat and USD 75 (one way) for a single 23kg check-in suitcase. I was travelling with my wife and 2 small kids. Our tickets already cost USD 1,400 each (round trip) and Swiss wanted to charge another USD 200 per person for us to sit together as a family and take check-in baggage on an intercontinental flight? Ridiculous!

The miles program has almost become useless and I recently cancelled my Miles and More credit card, as other programs just offer more value.

The food is still ok and the service tends to be good, with staff generally being well-trained. The business lounges in Zurich are excellent

All in all, it does feel like Swiss is increasingly milking its customers and that it is abandoning its status as a premium carrier. That may be a dangerous strategy and it also annoys me to see that a company priding itself with its ‚ÄúSwissness‚Äù is increasingly failing to provide the level of quality one would expect from a company carrying ‚ÄúSwiss‚Äù in its name.",August 2018,"August 6, 2018",2.0,,,,,,,,

Swiss Air cancelled my boyfriend's ticket,Singapore,Warsaw,International,"Good Day

I was unable to access the Feedback page and kept being redirected thus am writing on this forum.

I have just completed a round trip from Singapore to Warsaw and back, and have some Feedback regarding the trip.

In-flight services was up to standard for both trips. The crew was extremely friendly, helpful and courteous. There was a wide selection of food served, and beverages were given out frequently. On the flight back, there was a passenger with an infant and the crew paid utmost attention to both Mother and infant, ensuring all their needs. 
Overall I am satisfied with my flight experience with Swiss.

However, this was not the case for my boyfriend. We had booked tickets for this trip together but due to unforeseen circumstances, he was unable to take the flight from Singapore to Warsaw and instead, booked a separate flight at a later time. Due to the airline's 'No-show Policy', his return flight from Warsaw to Singapore was cancelled.

I understand that this was stated in the terms and conditions and admit that we did not read them thoroughly before making the booking. We were not aware of this cancellation up until the night before our flight. 

I am disappointed with the Singapore customer service that we received when we phoned them to do a check. Staff on the line was not the most courteous nor helpful which did not help our situation. I do hope that in the future, your staff would be able to empathise with passengers and deliver politeness even if it is the fault of the passenger. In addition, for return flights, I would suggest informing passengers that their entire itinerary has been cancelled so that it does not cause confusion nor panic.
Last but not the least, I implore you to review the 'no-show policy', as it is not the nicest to take off with passengers money and deny them a flight.

It would‚Äôve taken all day, and we would‚Äôve arrived late in the evening. Luckily, the gentleman at the service counter was able to book us from Z√ºrich to Vienna to Budapest. We still arrived nearly six hours later than our original flight but at least we made it in time to still enjoy dinner. 

The flight itself was impressive, compared to our American airliners. Despite being on a short flight, and in coach, we received two rounds of drink service and a sandwich as well. 

Despite arriving much later than anticipated, I would still give them 4 stars. The only reason I wouldn‚Äôt give 5 is because the seats were incredibly small and tight, and therefore not very comfortable. Granted we were in the last row because it was the last two seats available, but it was quite uncomfortable nonetheless.",August 2018,"August 2, 2018",4.0,,,,,,,,
Good flight,Zurich,London,Europe,"First time travelling with this airline. Check in was a little time consuming but airport was fairly busy. 

Once at gate, boarding was prompt as was take off.
Seats were comfortable with the usual space between seats ie if you are tall as we all are , your knees touch the seat in front of you.

Staff polite and helpful and smiled lots which is always nice.

Free movenpick ice cream was the snack provided , as were cold drinks and tea / coffee.

Singapore - Zurich - Athens,Singapore,Athens,International,"We flew Swiss to Athens from Singapore via Zurich. The aircraft used Singapore to Zurich was a Boeing 777 for a flight that lasted nearly 12 hours. The crew seemed a little aloof and going through the motions however once we took off their professionalism and hospitality came to the fore. Supper was delicious and served promptly, as departure from Singapore was 2330 local. The seat is impressive with ample amounts of storage and is very long, however it is a little narrow, which made getting to sleep a little awkward - having said that I did sleep undisturbed for nearly 8 hours. Breakfast was served prior to landing in Zurich and it was a wide selection of cold options - fruit, muesli, cold cuts and cheeses as well as warmed bakery items and hot omelet. 

The lounge in Zurich Terminal A / B for intra Shengen flights was rather congested - it should be bigger for the volume of customers it is serving. The Silence Area in the top section of the lounge was a great idea, however due to congestion it acts as overflow and promptly becomes the 'Non-Silence' section. Also important to note is that there are only 1 set of toilets in the lounge which are in high demand. Overall it is stylish lounge with a decent offering of food and beverages; I just wished it was bigger 

Zurich to Athens was operated by an Airbus A320 and the 2hour 30 flight to Athens was attended by bright cheerful crew who were made a final leg of our journey to Europe wonderful. A light breakfast was served with scrambled eggs, fruit and yoghurt.",July 2018,"August 2, 2018",4.0,,,,,,,,
Flug mit Swiss nach Dubai,Zurich,Dubai,International,Flying very often to Dubai and Abu Dhabi I have the opportunity to see differences between 3 airlines. Best one for me is certainly Emirates as well as I preferred the former aircrat types. Swiss aircrafts are in a way old fashioned. The technical and electronic equipment for customers in business class are not at the newest standard and especially the seat regulation should be improved or replaced. Service was very nice as usual. Food rather poor in comparison to Emirates and Ethiad. Overall it was a nice flight. Not really to complain about anything.,June 2018,"August 2, 2018",4.0,,,,,,,,

Lost our luggage and zero communication,Zurich,Boston,International,"We had 4 Business Class tickets and thought they might look after us a little better, given we spent a small fortune on the tickets. Swiss Air lost our luggage, which happens. They said they'd deliver it the next day, but then they just vanished. I tried to call them dozens of times, emailed them multiple times and got NOTHING. No one will answer the phone, they replied to my message 3 days later to ask if my bag had showed up yet!

"Swiss precision, quality, fairness-gi'me a break.",Zurich,Tel Aviv,International,"On the way from Tel Aviv to Zurich with LX253 on July 18th we had a 50 mins delay and arrived quite late in the evening. Had to cancel programs. Online check-in gently suggested by the airline didn't work as it should, 23 hours prior to departure but much later. The same story with the return flight. Online check-in  didn't work at all. Didn't get a seat even at the  check in counter but at the gate. Delay: 50 mins. Instead  of the regular A330, a smaller and tighter A321 waited us at the gate in Zurich on July 31st.    Matter-of-factish, families with small  kids  wanted to stay together. There were some misunderstandings between passengers. Captain and service chief came to resolve it since the aircraft had to take off in 5 minutes otherwise the flighht would have been  cancelled. I assume because of the delay. Landed late in Tel Aviv and had to sit and wait in the plane due again  to some timetable snag. The worse is to come. Waited one whole  hour for the luggage. More than 50 frustrated passengers were hit by the fact that Swiss didn't load all luggage into the smaller aircraft. The airline didn't advise the public about it. However, have seen crew picking up non-challantly their stuff.  After a full hour of standing on your feet, together with families with small children, the whole pack rushes then  to ""Lost and found"" where a large queue was greeting the already exhausted passengers. At 82 and endowed with aching legs, I didn't fill out any mandatory  forms and just  rushed home to send the necessary info by fax or email. Wonder whether it will work. The luggage supposed to arrive in the wee hours of the morning was expected for the evening hours. I regard the lack of transparency and the fact that the passengers were not advised that not all luggage was loaded as an unfair act on behalf of Swiss. It caused big frustration among all passengers especially to families with kids and seniors like myself. I fly Swiss quite often and basically it is a fair airline. I find this series of mishaps as a sign of alarm for both prospective passengers and Swiss management.",August 2018,"August 1, 2018",3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0
Worst service ever! Luggage lost!,Seattle,Athens,International,"We travelled from Seattle to Heathrow via British Airways. No problems at all. We retrieved our luggage no problems. We went to Swiss Airlines got our baggage tags for our luggage. Lined up to check our bags. Told we could not pay for our luggage there but had to go to the ticket counter to pay. We waited almost 2 hours to pay. We checked with baggage again and were told we had to wait. Eventually we were told we didn‚Äôt have to wait in the regular ticket line. We were getting concerned we would miss our flight. As we checked our bags the Agent said there was trouble with the belt. She assured our luggage would meet us in Athens. We took SWISS Airline from Heathrow to Z√ºrich then from Zurich to Athens. 
When we arrived  in Athens we waited till everyone had gone and no luggage. We reported our luggage lost with others in the airport. This took several hours. We filled out the paperwork. 
Finally at 4 in the morning we left for our hotel. 
They had told us they will call when the luggage was found. It‚Äôs been 5 days and we have had to contact them every day.
Apparently our luggage MAY have been found but we still have not received it. The tracking website shows different airports where our luggage is. This has basically ruined the first part of trip. We have spent so much time on the phone as well as shopping for clothes/bathing suits. On the website it states they will reimburse $100 per person.

Poor communication from Swiss Air,Birmingham,Zurich,Europe,Our family of 4 travelled to Switzerland for a one week holiday. Our bags were left at Birmingham airport. Swiss air told us they would be on the next flight and delivered the next days. We waited 3 days! The worst was the lack of communication.

One of the worst,Frankfurt,Zurich,Europe,"Being frequent international travelers, this was a very nasty surprise. We flew form Marseilles to Zurich of which the first leg was great on Lufthansa up to Frankfurt. Then there was a 1.5 hour delay, with NO announcements at Frankfurt airport right at the gate. Then the flight was further delayed and we sat in the aircraft for 30 minutes in what looked like an 80's aircraft. Already our plans for the day were ruined. There was no tea or coffee (NO HOT DRINKS SERVED!!).  The icing on the cake was: then one of our bags were lost. So we spent another 1 hour waiting for it then reporting it (another family from the US had a similar but worse fate with two of their bags not arriving). So my 10 year old son had to wear MY CLOTHES in order to be able to go to the snow mountains as his bag had not arrived and he had no clothing to wear!!! Swiss air delivered the bag after 24 hours, and DID NOT compensate us for this trouble! They should be ashamed and revamp at least their customer service if not their airline service.

First I could associate all 4 passengers travelling together, enter all passport information and check in to receive the boarding passes electronically. On board the staff was friendly and even served a small sandwich, beverage and Swiss chocolate even though this is a flight under 2 hours in duration. Seats were OK, I am 183 (6 feet) and I can just squeeze in, but this is also aligned with my expectation for economy class seating. Before touchdown we would get on screen information of which belt the luggage could be picked up at (not relevant for us as it was checked in all the way to the final destination).

Kiev,Zurich,Kyiv,Europe,I will give you a short synopsis and you can decide.  Cancelled my flight in Vegas then they rebooked a latter -20 minutes or so.  FYI  I had a 3 hour and 15 minute layover in Toronto to catch Ukrainian air- flight to Kiev. Then the delays in Las Vegas started- amounted to about an hour.  Landed in Toronto about an hour and 20 minutes late.  We then were delayed on the Tarmac for about another hour.  We then had to go to customs which is a mess in Toronto.  We had no Air Canada Staff there to expedite.  The staff there could care less.  Ran to a different terminal and of course Ukrainian air had closed.  Took another 2 to 3 hours to find any AC staff to help.  Finally got us a room for a couple hours of sleep then a flight the next day to Zurich- then a flight with Swiss Air to Kiev.  This would put us in Kiev a day late.  Remember prepaid rooms in Kiev.  Got to Zurich the next day and then the flight to Kiev.  We landed in kiev with no baggage.  We finally got our baggage in kiev 5 days after we left Las Vegas.  Very disappointed with Air Canada and Swiss Air.  Very disorganized and nonchalant about other people's money.

Risk to loose your return if you don't take the departure flight ?!!!,Paris,Bangkok,International,"Risk to loose your return if you don't take the departure flight ?!!!
I figured out when i was making my reservation, that it was the same price to take a go and return flight or a one way only, so i took the 2 ticket. Gift to my parents, but only one of them would take the 2 flights, cause the other was in an other place and could not take the departure flight and would come to thailand through an other way .

... The company charged me an extra 300 euros ""to cancel"" the departure flight ?!!!!!!!!! 
Cause i could not only ask them to cancel the departure, but had to cancel the full ticket to take a new one way ticket. So from 450 this ticket came up to 750 euros !!!!

Good service and good business class seats,New York City,Johannesburg,International,We travelled business clas from Kennedy Airport to Zurich then from Zurich to OR Tambo in Johannesburg. The seats were the usual business class lay flat seats. Easy enough to sleep in but could have been wider. Row 5 had narrower aisle seats than other rows and was near the bathroom.

These seats have significantly less space and if you‚Äôre in row 5 people stand there while waiting to use bathroom.

The first time this happened I thought that it was a Christmas thing (as the flight was during December). However, subsequently discovered that it's part of the normal service. A clever touch on this trip however as, probably due to the World Cup being on, instead of the usual tablets/mini-bars, we were given mini football-shaped chocolates. Nice!

Anyway nothing to sing its praises in any way shape or form. I have seen better in other carriers Premium economy!  If you think that Swiss Air are the slick watch like precision expected of Switzerland then think again! 
When you pay the extra for a bit of comfort, style and superior service......it would be accepted that this is what you receive! It seems like Swiss Airways are cramming in the Business class seats to get the additional income without the Business class service!

I phoned and asked why we were moved and the agent could not explain, advised me to ask when we dropped our bags at MIA.  The Swiss Air rep there was unhelpful, and claimed we had not paid enough for those seats.  These were not any type of upgrade and at no time were we approached on this before check in.  This was not a change in the type of aircraft, seating plan was exactly as it always had been.  Very disappointed.  Thankfully we did get at least get these seats on our return flight.  As this was an international flight being in the wrong seats is a big deal.  Even worse, a small boy in the seat behind me kicked the back of my seat vigorously for most of the trip.

Honestly, did not even think it was a possibility that ANY airline would seat young kids away from their parents...they did recommend that we contact Swiss for the return. We called Swiss thinking it would be just as easy and ""charge free"". Nope...Swiss wants a seat assignment fee, and claims there is no way around the system, which is ""pre-programmed"", and there is apparently nobody that can override ""they system""...Ben was sure to also let me know that no supervisors were available (unprompted, as though he knew what I'd be asking for), but could call back every half hour or hour to see if one becomes available. I guess that makes sense...supervisors must be the busiest people at Swiss, trying to calm down angry customers at their ridiculous policies.

We had only 75 minutes to change - but it was more than enough, because the Zurich Airport isn‚Äôt too big, and there is a fast train connection among the terminals. The short trip wasn‚Äôt a special experience - the airplane was small, business class only meant a bit comfortable seats and some food.

On our way to Vegas there wasn‚Äôt any delay, but the return fligt was late: it departed two hours later because of a storm, so we weren‚Äôt able to catch our flight in Zurich.

Punctual and Comfortable,San Diego,Venice,International,"Our overall experience was great!  Roomy seats, accommodating staff, the food was decent and each of our flights was on time.  One can't ask for much more.

Tips for US citizens:
1. When the airline states that you need to be on the plane 30 minutes before takeoff,  be on that plane 30 minutes before takeoff (we made it by two minutes and nearly missed our flight - the staff was very strict)

2. Baggage tips for those who want to travel without checking luggage:
The airline allows 2 cabin bags onto the plane.  One personal item (think laptop bag or grocery tote) and one larger item which cannot exceed 46 liters.  (Measurement expectations are: 56cm x 36cm x 23cm with a maximum weight of 7kg) 

My husband and I chose to try ""one bag travel"" for our three weeks in Europe and selected the Osprey 46 backpack which for the long haul flight was fine. (Whew!)  

However, when we arrived in Zurich for our connecting flight we noticed the airline staff measuring the bags using the metal crates many of us see at airports in the states but never use as many of the US based carriers are relatively lenient.  While the Osprey certainly met the over-all size requirement, it was a little deeper than the 23cm requirement which meant we ran the risk of having to check our bags. (No thank you)

What saved us?  Packable totes.  

I cannot recommend these enough.  They allowed us to remove a few key items so we could shift the rest of our belongings and easily fit the required measurements.  They also allowed us to keep things like laptops, phones, tablets and other toiletries we wanted access to under our seats while our larger backpacks were stowed in the overhead compartments.

In short - while some Swiss Air staff may not measure the cabin bags, be prepared with alternatives in case they should decide to do so.",June 2018,"July 12, 2018",4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0

After flying Singapore (which is always exceptional) this was a serious downgrade! The set up & service felt like a bad effort at matching premium in Qantas or other top tier airlines. The bed was cramped & uncomfortable. Had to clamber over my husband to get out of the cubicle when he was lying down sleeping. Literally had to stand on my seat to step over him.

Europe Vacation,Hong Kong,Zurich,International,"This is the 3rd time I have flown Swiss Air Business Class form Hong Kong to Zurich in the last 12 months and each flight went without a hitch. I flew to Hong Kong from Auckland on Air NZ Business Class so the comparison would be interesting. Firstly the seat/bed; Air NZ has everyone beat with their completely lie-flat bed that is very comfortable with a separate padded mattress and is surprisingly spacious; definately  the best I have experienced. Swiss Air has a seat that slides forward to a nearly flat surface but it is uncomfortable and very cramped; your feet/legs end up in a small tunnel under the seat in front which is too small and your shoulders/arms are not supported; only an average experience. The service and food on Swiss was very good, and the plane seemed modern and very clean; excellent friendly young cabin crew were helpful and efficient. Their uniforms are smart and stylish, much better than Air NZ‚Äôs frumpy looking multi coloured outfits that look old fashioned and certainly don‚Äôt make the crew look professional. The plane took off on time and landed on time. Check-in by the way was well policed strictly holding back economy passenger who tried to join the business/first passengers queue. The Swiss Airline has a great range of Duty Free items in a comprehensive catalogue on board so I purchased a watch each for my son and daughter. The TV screen is large and easy to use and the range of movies etc is comprehensive; headphones and not noise-cancelling which was a disappointment.

Flight was punctual (on both flights the plane landed within 15 min.s of the scheduled time).

Aircraft (it was a 737-300ER) proudly displayed a Wifi simbol on the door but of course Wifi on board is extremely expensive
Also on Swiss site you can down-load magazines prior to your flight but if you fly economy your choice might be limited to a single item.
Also be aware that in economy your hand-baggage allowance is limited: you are allowed a single item with a weight below 8 Kg. However you can take in addition a laptop bag (it is not clearly mentioned in the page).
As with other airlines the smartphone App had some issues. For some time I was unable to log in with my Miles&More ID (same ID worked on Swiss Web page); also on the return flight I was able to check-in on the app but for some reason the boarding pass did not show up in the app itself.

The legroom on the flight wasn‚Äôt bad but not outstanding. You get a blanket, pillow and some headphones. I would recommend to bring your own (if possible noise canceling) because the aircraft is pretty loud.

The staff was the only saving grace on this flight,New York City,Rome,International,"Let's start with the bad: My main complaint here is the aircraft itself. I have never in my life been so crowded in a seat. I'm not sure how old the equipment was, but my sister and I were incredibly uncomfortable. We're average to tall women, but we are otherwise average-sized people. I couldn't imagine how badly significantly obese people or taller than average people would feel. 

The legroom is minimal (again, shortest distance I've experienced) and when the woman in front of me jerked her chair back, she was nearly in my lap. Not to mention it just fell back without any resistance, so it nearly spilled my tray of food all over my lap. (To boot, she was a jerk about it, particularly to the very kind attendant). I also had to be careful with my seat recline, come to think of it.

On that note, I will say the attendants were among the friendliest I've encountered. Particularly on the NYC‚ÄìZurich leg of the trip. Thanks to them, we were not miserable despite our discomfort in the seats. So, big kudos to the staff.

1,New York City,Zurich,International,"On the way fly back to Switzerland from New York with Swiss International Airline, I felt it's a company with racial discrimination. This woman from my back seat used her knees to push my chair back. She even put her bare foot on my armrest. I couldn't even adjust my chair back a little bit. 

My husband asked her to remove her knees so that I could adjust my chair but she refused. So we called the flight attendant. They didn't even asked her to do something but laughed at me for wanting be sit next to my husband. They asked me instead the one who put her knees on my chair back to move to the next seat. ( we both got an empty seat next to her and me.) Sadly, no one around said anything to help me and I was the only Asia woman at this place. 

I wondered why I paid extra to reserve a seat next to my husband and got bothered  but the flight attendant asked me to move, not her. If bothering other people has right to stay where they are and keep bothering others, and the one who got bothered and complained is the one to blame, then Swiss International Airline will be my last choice!

Not the clockwork precision expected from Swiss,Bangkok,Amsterdam,International,"Sloppy, uninterested, unavailable for comments or criticism. That is how we experienced Swiss. Booking went wrong and although this was solely their mistake they were able to only offer me a much (!) more expensive ticket. My complaints had the impact on Swiss like water on a duck skin. Result, I had to search myself for a cheaper ticket (which I found btw) and we were not able to sit together during the flight.

Two-segment european flight in the summer,Valencia,Moscow,Russia,"Used Swiss as a return flights from vacations; 2 daytime segments with 5 hour stopover at Zurich.
Planes were good, rather new and clean. Though headlight above my seat sometimes dimmed for unknown reasons. Crews are perfect. Economy breakfast and dinner were kind of simple, but offered wine, beer, juices without any restrictions.
Flights were almost as scheduled (little 30 min delay for second segment).

The only strange thing is seat selection. When I checked in, I selected seats 9A/B and got the boarding passes. But just before the gate, airport staff quickly re-printed new passed for the 8A/B seats. Nothing to worry, but seems my 9-row seats were just given to someone else. That's strange and it probably could be worse. Both rows are the same class and no emergency exits at them.

Nightmare trip,Zurich,Malaga,Europe,"As usual with flights out of Zurich, this flight left 45 minutes late. Minutes before landing in Malaga, with the wheels out, the plane restarted the ascent. It went circling around the coast. The pilot informed us that this was due to tail winds faster than what is the legally allowed limit for a plane to land. After about half an hour we were diverted to Granada, where they refuelled and after another interminable wait we finally left for Malaga, where we landed a whooping 3 and a half hours later. While in Granada, the pilot told us (what I don't believe a second) that there were winds from the North and from the Sounth. Also, this was the only diverted flight, all others landed without incident. I am also wondering how come that the pilot realized about the tail winds just when we were about to land.

The only thing they could offer us at that late point (when we were finally served), was a night at a local hotel, and an early flight to Stutgart, and then another plane to Graz - arriving in Graz almost 20 hours late.
The explanation from Swiss air was, that the winds in Zurich airport made everybody delayed? All planes where leaving on time while i waited in the never ending queue.

Saving cost at the expense of customer safety,Zurich,Johannesburg,International,"Our flight was scheduled 3 July 2018 to depart from Zurich to Johannesburg. The flight was eventually cancelled due to a problem with the caterers supplying foods/drinks for the flight. Such circumstances are not out of the ordinary.

The flight itself was great: the food was excellent, the drink selection was good and the cabin crew were friendly and personal (even in light of the fact that the business class cabin was quite large for a European flight and fully booked). There was plenty of legroom for a European flight and the cartoon shown on the screens was adding an entertaining g background ambience. Although I only had a very short connection from a delayed flight into Zurich, my checked luggage was successfully transferred onto this flight. I was positively surprised that the priority tags on the luggage really did seem to have an effect and that Swiss‚Äôs airport operations at Zurich were very efficient in this respect.

The not-so-good:
Boarding at Zurich airport was rather chaotic and it almost seemed as if the gate staff had never handled this procedure before. It was as if everyone was pushing onto a local bus service; gate staff were timid and did not take control effectively of the situation.
The flight was also delayed (as were many flights that day at Zurich).

Horrific customer experience for hundreds,Vienna,Newark,International,The flights were not the issue.  The 6 hours standing in a transfer line with hundreds of other travelers highlights a company that has serious problem with unscripted events.  Travelers appreciate weather delays are a part of flying and in most cases will understand the airlines are making the best of a bad situation.  This airline made matters exponentially worse than they should have by providing very little information or misleading statements at every opportunity. The worst customer treatment I've ever seen from any company regardless of industry.  This flight was missed and had to be rescheduled for the next day.

First longhaul Swiss,Zurich,Montreal,International,"I flew economy on Swiss from Zurich to Montreal on an A330-300. 

The experience started off with a disappointing wait at passport check at the gate, which one finds in many airports in Europe. There were two lines, and the other line was processing passports efficiently. However, in my line, an indifferent agent took ages to get her act together, and when she finally started to take passports, she only gave me a blank and cold look. 

The seats on this aircraft are really tight. I am not that tall (170 cm short) and yet the distance between my knee and the front seat was ~5 cm. I cannot imagine how taller people would feel. 

The controller for the IFE is in the armrest, and they have a hole in it to allow the controller to be visible. However, this hole makes the armrest uncomfortable. 

Food was not bad. Not great, but good for economy. 

Service was ok, but I felt a difference from the Swiss intra-European flight I took earlier, which was very warm but professional. 

In short, not bad, but in the future, I probably would avoid economy in a longhaul Swiss flight.",June 2018,"July 1, 2018",2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

My friend and I sat in 35AB and we had our own space to spread out. Although we always wish there was more leg room, it was adequate. What I think distinguishes Swiss Air above most of the rest is the plentiful and delicious food.

heavily delayed (airtraffic control restrictions) but most crew members on board were friendly,Amsterdam,Zurich,Europe,"On Tuesday evening 26 June I took LX735 from Amsterdam to Zurich. Departure was delayed by roughly 1 hour and 20 minutes due to late arrival of the aircraft (which was due to delays on earlier flights of this aircraft (HB-IOK, A321-111) which was caused by congestion and air traffic restrictions in parts of the European airspace that day. Boarding took rather long and I think part of the problem is that legacy airlines, such as Swiss (and many other European airlines) have all adoped (many elements of) the low-cost model and included several types of economy tickets, whereby hold luggage is not included in the tickets at the lower end of the spectrum. So even though there are restrictions on what passengers can take with them as hand luggage, if there are too many passengers bringing on board the maximum carry-on luggage allowance, there is just not enough space in the overhead bins. This causes additional delays. 

The aircraft cabin was clean and looked relatively new/fresh (despite the age of this aircraft which is somewhere between 19 and 20 years, according to airfleets), so it seems that Swiss takes good care of their aircraft (cabins). 

My seat (29D) was ok and legroom was sufficient.

Worst travel experience ever,Amsterdam,Hong Kong,International,"The flight was supposed to fly from AMS to ZRH with 1.5 hour transit time to catch the next plane from ZRH to HKG. However the flight was already delayed for over 2 hours. Upon arrival at ZRH, the stewards all claim that we can still make it for the next flight and we should run to the departing gate. 
Together with another pair of travelers we tried to catch the flight, do note that there is a transit train in between the two gates and it was well over midnight by the time we arrived. After finally getting to the gate, the plane was still there but the gate was closed and the stewards refused us to let us on board. Nothing can be done and end of story. 

Then the transfer desk only option is either by Aerofloat (older plane so not recommended by service agent) Another option is through Delhi. Again 2 hours transit time and 2 hours delayed. Upon arrival went to the transfer desk and agent noted on boardingpass gate 14 and told us to run. After going through a ridiculous security check, we ran all the way to the west wing (20 min) just to find that the gate was incorrect and that we were supposed to gate 7 all the way to the east wing (another 20 min). As you can imagine that I was travelling with my elder mother for the first time, this was the worst travel experience that she can get.

When did Swiss decide to become cheap like Easy Jet without the cheap tickets??,Athens,Canton of Geneva,Europe,"The reason I don't fly Easy Jet is due to the seat size for my legs (5""11) and having to buy water and coffee. Now SWISS thinks ok to do the same without at least lowering their ticket cost. My mistake to maybe not have read about the change but on my trip to Athens I got a meal, water etc included in my ticket, but on the way back No. I somehow became Economy light rather than classic... no idea how this happened. Plus, the stewards have a smirk when they serve the guy next to you his complimentary ""meal"" (it looked horrible anyways) and just give you a glass of tepid water. I really don't care about eating plane food, it was only a 3hr flight. But the whole attitude about it, and the way they treated you was abhorrent.  
After that, Swiss (well Switzerland in general) is usually known for efficiency... we didn't get that as we were 40min was late, and late again. No excuses, no explanations, no apologies, Nada.
I used to fly Swiss a lot, but the new changes in the way the crew treats you, the ENORMOUS bins with the MINUSCULE screen. Plus now having to pay for a cup of coffee with an early morning flight. I'll look for any other ticket before I go back to Swiss.",,"June 23, 2018",1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,

EVENTS
On Monday 21st of May, I had a flight with Swiss from Madrid to Singapore returning on
Thursday 24th :

‚Ä¢ Madrid -> Zurich
o Flight #: LX2033
o Terminal: 2

‚Ä¢ Zurich -> Singapore
o Flight #: LX176

So, I checked in at 17:30 at terminal T2 for my flight for Zurich.

When I was going to board the plane at 19:55 (it was quite late, the plane was delayed for over 40 min) I was told that I could not board that plane. The reason being:
‚ÄúWe have detected that you were going to miss your connecting flight due to the delay on this plane and
we have booked you a new flight at 22:30 to Dubai with Iberia and from there to Singapore. Therefore,
you should go downstairs - Room 6 - pick up your luggage from belts 11 or 12 and go to the Iberia counter at the T4 Terminal‚Äù.

The person from Swiss that actually told me this, wrote it down for me in my boarding pass and was ‚Äúnice‚Äù enough as to give me a voucher for 7 ‚Ç¨ on drinks for the trouble (attached pictures).

So, I decided to go downstairs to get my luggage and from there go to the Terminal 4.

After some 45 min of waiting I was able to retrieve my luggage and I went to the Iberia‚Äôs counter at
Terminal T4 as I was told, just to find out that, the girl from Iberia had absolutely no clue of what I was talking about. I asked her if Swiss might have booked the flight for me directly without her knowing and told me that: ‚ÄúThat is impossible since Iberia does not fly to Dubai‚Äù. So, she suggested that I should go to talk to Emirates in case Swiss had booked me with them.

I decided to go to the Emirates counter and I had the same response from the attendant there. She told me that:
‚ÄúSwiss had been sending people to Emirates for delays all day but that I had no reservation under my name‚Äù.

She decided to call Swiss in Terminal T2 and figure out what was going on. After some back and forth, it seemed I had a flight with Qatar Airways (?!?!?) at 22:35 but I was not able to take it since it already was 22:10.

The person from Swiss also notified the attendant from Emirates that she was finishing her shift and
that she was leaving for the day but that I could call the following numbers (they show on the boarding
pass picture written by the Emirate‚Äôs attendant):

‚Ä¢ 902 883 882 (Not available 24h)
‚Ä¢ + 49 6986 799 799 (24h)

So, I decided to call the second number to get some information and see any alternatives I might have
had, to my surprise this was the phone number for Lufthansa (?!?!?) and they told me there was nothing
they could do except give me the Swiss phone number:
‚Ä¢ 901 116 712 (Not available 24h)

After this, I decided to go home and call Swiss first thing in the morning. When I called them, I was told that, I needed to ask for a refund. But in order for me to do that, I had to call American Express (since I made the reservation with them and that there was nothing they could do). Also, they
mentioned to me that in order to get some sort of ‚Äúofficial explanation‚Äù I could use for work related
reasons I had to email them in order to obtain it.

So, after 1 month of waiting I was told that they just do not care and that they did nothing wrong and that if I want something that I should just involve my lawyers (which I will absolutely do) and I will publish the resolution for them to feel ashamed of themselves since they do not care about their customers and/or their reputation.

I recommend for you guys to never use them since I was lucky that I was left in Madrid and I could return home but I'm just afraid of what might have happened if I was left in another country where I did not have anyone or anything.",May 2018,"June 22, 2018",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
Excellent In-flight Service; Awful Tiny Seating Space,Athens,Los Angeles,International,"Strike 1: Lufthansa, through whom I booked this flight, told me that I needed to be at the airport 3 hours ahead for this flight. So I arrived at 3:30am for my 6:30am flight.  However, the  Swiss Air employees do not arrive to check people in until 2 hours before the flight. So a group of other customers and I sat/stood there waiting at a painfully early time for the employees to arrive to check us in.
Strike 2: I got onto the plane in Athens to fly first to Zurich for a 6:30am flight. I asked the attendant for a blanket as it was cold. He asked to look at my ticket. He said, ""No blankets for economy class."" So I froze.
Strike 3: I changed planes in Zurich and got onto a brand new plane. I am a 5'5"" tall woman, under 125 pounds with a small frame. My knees were knocking into the seat in front of me the entire flight (all 11-hours). Anytime the person in front of me leaned back or tried adjusting his seat, his chair hit my knees. It was painful and distracting. The slim 6' tall guy sitting beside me literally had to sit with his knees to the left and to the right and was spilling over into the other seats just to fit his legs. Embarrassing that the airlines have stooped so low as to provide clients with such an uncomfortable experience. 
Strike 4: The food was less than mediocre.
Plus 1: The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful--some of the best I've encountered.
Plus 2: The online entertainment worked perfectly with no delays, with exception to headphones that did not work but were immediately replaced by staff.
Plus 3: I asked for a toothbrush and eye-mask and was promptly provided with them. However, international flights used to include this on all seats upon arrival. 
Plus 5: The pillows and blankets provided were comfortable.
Plus 6: The actual seat itself felt comfortable; it was just entirely too close to the seat in front of it.",June 2018,"June 22, 2018",2.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,2.0
Worst experience on an international airline in my 45 years of flying in Africa.,Johannesburg,Zurich,International,"Because I fly to Africa frequently (for the last four decades), I have flown on many major airlines including United, Delta, South African Airways, Virgin, British Airways, Air France, and Lufthansa -- and even years ago on Pan Am and TWA.  All my experiences with those airlines was either good to excellent.  So I was looking forward to flying on SWISS AIR for the first time.  What a miserable experience I had last week flying from Johannesburg to Zurich.  A real torture trip on an ANCIENT Airbus that had the tightest seating of any plane I've ever been on.  I even paid $40 for choice of the worst seat I've ever had on an airliner. The entertainment system still used remote controls that seldom worked. The food was laughable.  My dinner was boiled pasta with a dollop of red sauce.  I kid you not!  Breakfast was one crescent roll with two pieces of cheese. (They gave you one little piece of Swiss chocolate as a token).  The crew was very friendly, so it's not their fault that the company goes CHEAP.  Maybe they're improving from what I've read of other reviews, but avoid SWISS AIR on the Johnnesburg to Zurich route.  And the trip was 10 hours of misery.  Everyone was grumbling about the pathetic so-called dinner and ridiculous ""breakfast"" and torture seats.",June 2018,"June 22, 2018",1.0,,,,,,,,

"Singapore to Zurich - Amsterdam, and London to Zurich - Singapore",Zurich,Singapore,International,"My experience with Swissair has been nothing but fantastic. The flights were on time, the cabin crew excellent, and the entertainment adequate. 

I would like to give a big shoutout to Beatrice and the team on flight LX176, on the 20th of June. This for me really defined Swissair from the previous airlines that I have flown on. 

I was originally assigned an aisle seat when I checked in at Heathrow, and when I was in transit at Zurich, I tried my luck asking the gate attendant if a seat at the front row was possible as I got a really bad cramp from the previous flight. He told me yes, and changed our seats, but to my horror, he had assigned me a seat right in the middle of the plane, nowhere near to the front, nor an aisle! I highlighted this upon entering the aircraft, and this is where Beatrice's professionalism came in.  

She tried valiantly to find us a seat at the front, but when it was not possible (again the gate attendant should've just said no), I grumpily sat in the middle, mentally promising myself to write a 0 star review for Zurich Airport. She could have easily left it as that, but she continuously spoke to other passengers, and eventually found a passenger who was willing to move (as he was travelling alone), and shifted me to the aisle seat. 
That really made the flight for me, changing my entire experience. 

A huge thank you to Beatrice and the team for taking care of this grumpy old man. 

Disclaimer - I am a rather large person, hence when possible I always ask for an aisle seat/front row seat if possible. My displeasure only arose from the fact that the gate attendant pretty much screwed everything up.",June 2018,"June 21, 2018",5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,5.0
It is all about the seat in Business Class.,Los Angeles,Zurich,International,"Since I often travel on Lufthansa flights back and forth to the US, trying Swiss in Business was a nice variety.

I arrived at the airport with plenty of time to spare and check-in was done in a rather fast manner. I headed through security, which was also done pretty fast, which is unusual at LAX. I went straight to the Star Alliance Business Class lounge and enjoyed the outside terrace. 

At check-in, I was awarded seat 17K, a seat in the very last row of the Business Class cabin. At first, I thought ""I don't want to sit all the way in the back"", but it was good choice. I booked the flight on the morning of departure and didn't get a chance to preselect a seat. So, I got one of the throne seats with not paying an additional fee. Usually, Swiss charges a fee if you select one of those seats. 

As for the seat: the throne seats have plenty of storage space since they have a console to both sides of the seat. While it is nice to have so much storage space, the seat gives one a little bit the feeling as if you are sleeping in a coffin. The space around the shoulders is great, though. Despite that mixed review, I managed to get a good night sleep. 

The flight attendants on that particular flight were friendly, but not really engaging. When i ordered a tea, I had to wait for more than 30 minutes to get it. Also, the meal service was done from carts rather than bringing out the tablets individually. The dinner service started from the front of the cabin, which made the bathrooms inaccessible during that time, since the carts were blocking the aisle. Lufthansa does a better job on their meal service. Breakfast service started almost two hours before landing, which I thought, was way too early. 

The entertainment selection was great and Swiss opted to install decent screens on their Boeing 777-300ER. Since I always use my own set of headphones, I cannot judge the provided headphones. 

Overall, I think Lufthansa does provide better food and better service on their flights, but Swiss shines in two areas: I prefer their business class seat over Lufthansa's and connecting in Zurich is much easier than in Munich (soso) or Frankfurt (horrible).",April 2018,"June 21, 2018",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0

A Comprehensive review of  SWISS / EDELWEISS Airlines overview of flights between Costa Rica and England via Zurich rate,San Jose,Birmingham,International,"A Comprehensive review of  SWISS / EDELWEISS Airlines overview of flights between Costa Rica and England via Zurich rated on a scale of 1 ‚Äì 10 , 1 being Terrible , 10 being excellent .
Punctuality.
We used four flights on this particular trip with Swiss Air or its share code partners , of which NONE were on time according to the schedule , an average of 1 hour late on all of the flights with NO real explanation given.
However it is blatantly obvious that the reason for this is down to bad organization , bad management and planning . Rating  5/10
Quality of Service .
We had never flown via Swiss Airlines previously and probably will never do so again as the experience was NOT good , having previously used British Airways , Air France , Iberia ,and Klm we would certainly chose any of these before using Swiss Air the reasons will be mentioned in this report . 
Our first bad experience was an email request to Swiss Air for assistance about our booking ,we NEVER had a reply to our request even 14 days after it was put in the only reason we ever did get an answer was because I obtained the email directly to Swiss Airs CEO.
Swiss Airs customer service is located in Fiji believe it or not and they obviously have zero interest in replying to customer enquiries , probably the worst customer service we have ever seen for a service industry provider .
On board the aircraft the service you will receive at best can be described as average you as basically treated as cattle in economy class , probably a little better in economy plus or business .
BEWARE OF HIDDEN COSTS . NO free alcoholic beverages in economy class you will be charged for a beer or glass of wine with the SMALL meal you will receive and the average cost is around $10 per drink, all of the other mentioned airlines offer alcoholic beverages as a courtesy to their customers. Rating 3/10.
Comfort on Board and hidden extra expense in Economy Class .
BE WARNED for a long haul flight the seating setup is probably the most uncomfortable we have ever experienced on any long haul carrier .
The seats are much smaller than other airlines we have used in the past , the seats are very tight and small little of no room to move and we are only small bodied people 1.64 and around 70kgs .
The seats are only just big enough to sit in , very  very close together I would estimate around 5cm space between your knees and the rear of the seat in front of you I.E. zero leg room very tight fit .
Your seat will only recline around 8cm therefore you are basically upright , however when the person in front  of you reclines their seat you will be boxed in no room to move .
To be able to consume the small average quality meal you will receive no choice offered ( usually you will get 2 options but not here ) you will be expected to perform a contortion act to be able to consume your food .
Although the aircraft are new and clean the comfort level in economy class is extremely bad and we would not recommend it . Rating 3/10 

Hidden Extra Costs Involved using Swiss .
BE WARE .  If your baggage is just slightly overweight 23kgs max you will be charged an excess baggage fee of approximately $200 per suitcase , most other airlines make allowances for a little extra weight on long haul flights NOT Swiss .
Also as previously mentioned only soft drinks are free in economy class , a beer or glass of wine with your meal will cost on average $10 each .
Because of the terrible seating configuration in economy class you will be offered the chance to upgrade to economy plus or business , the average cost for economy plus is $120 per person , business a little over $400 per person  , it appears the configuration is set this way to obligate larger framed people to pay the extra cost to up grade .
This would then mean that you make no real saving on Swiss Airlines slightly cheaper fares as in the end you will end up paying the same price as other carriers who offer a better more comfortable service with no extra cost  and whom are on schedule , please take these hidden extras into consideration before booking Swiss Air .
Also note that on board all though being a flight originating from a Spanish speaking area NO instruction‚Äôs on board are given in Spanish if you do not speak German or English you will have no understanding of what is being said over the on board speakers  I would consider this dangerous and maybe even illegal when coming down to safety instructions . Rating 3/10
Excess baggage charges .
We paid excess baggage charges for a suitcase that was approximately 4kg  over the weight limit , the cost of this was around $200 which we considered excessive but that is the rules with Swiss Air .
However when our luggage was delivered in Costa Rica my suitcase was completely destroyed , split open , missing contents , it is obvious that something very heavy had been put on top of it or it was ran over as even the metal supporting frame inside was all bent .
NO Swiss Air representative was on site so that I could make a claim or report  ( excellent customer service hahahaha ) 
Therefore we paid excess baggage for a case that was returned to us in an unusable condition , with items missing , I filled a report with Swiss Air via email with photographic evidence and now they state I will have to wait while they investigate , they had no problem charging me when the case was booked in but now I am out $200 excess baggage and around $400 for anew case and the personal items missing due to Swiss Airs  baggage  handlers they have to investigate  that goes to show you the type of service you can expect from Swiss Air . Rating 3/10
Overall Experience .
We would strongly suggest using any other carrier option rather than Swiss Air , as the service you will get is well below that of other carriers available to you .
Not something you would expect from the Swiss as usually their service and quality is of the very best and high standard however not the case with this airline .

Mr Ronnie Chan,Zurich,London,Europe,"I took your flight on LX388 on 3Jun 2018 ZRH TO LHR. We were four of us. On arrival to the boarding gate , we were surprised no staff was at the gate 50 minutes before the departure. We went into the boarding room and found the room empty and there was no plane docked at the gate. Smelling something not right I then checked the Screen and noticed a remark in a Swiss language that I don't understand. I checked with one airport staff and she said the flight is cancelled. Then I asked her what I should do since there is no LX staff. She gave me directions where to go. I had to clear immigration control myself and find my way to the transfer desk.
At the transfer desk was a long Q and no LX staff available to give assistance except the handling agent staff busy with their work. No information given to passenger about the flight cancellation . This is really chaos. Before that I had to pay for my excess baggage and the staff showed me direction to make payment. I had to walk a few hundred meters to another building to make payment. This is ridiculous making passenger very inconvenient and even then LX has separate counter for payment. One counter for cash payment and another one for credit card payment which is another distance. Never understand why LX is so disorganised .

Disappointed,Zurich,Bangkok,International,"Pros: punctuality, cleanliness on board, luggage delivered in reasonable time. 
Cons: (1)while asking for seats being next one another, our extra leg room seats (with extra price) were riassigned. We were not told that at the check in counter and nothing was done on board except for being given a name card to ask for reimbursement. We'll go through the process and we'll see. 
(2) average quality food, (3) NOT friendly staff. During the Night I stood in the area next to the kitchen for more than an hour to stretch and stand.  I was asked once if I felt OK, and then the staff simply draw the curtain for all the time and not engaged in a talk. Surprisingly they don't even ask if you want a drink or something.

On flights within Europe, Business Class seats are much the same, but the middle seat remains unsold so this gives additional space. We felt this was a good choice because leg room on their flights is already ample compared to US airlines, and the upgrade allowed us to use priority check-in and security stations as well as the airport lounge. We also had a very nice Business Class meal on the flight.

Always my first choice of airline!,Birmingham,Naples,Europe,"We were flying to Naples via Zurich, from Birmingham. Check-in was very quick - we arrived early and there was no queue at all! 
As I was using a walking stick, we were given priority boarding and asked if I was able to cope with steps etc on the way to the plane, which was nice.
We boarded more or less on time but takeoff  was delayed due to French air traffic problems but we were supplied with water and a small chocolate bar while we waited. Eventually we took off about 50 minutes late. We were rather concerned as we only had a 45 minute slot to transfer in Zurich. There seemed little information and when we arrived in Zurich we assumed that we had missed the connecting flight. However on the transfer bus screen we could see the flight also listed as delayed/ held.  So a fast dash across the airport and we made it!  (Another time I think I would ask for assistance across the airport)
Flights were comfortable as always with onboard drinks and a snack included (unlike certain other airlines), a good allowance for both hold and cabin luggage, free seat reservations  available online when we booked.  Prices compare very well with other airlines which charge extra for all of the above!

First remains a top notch product,Miami,Zurich,International,"Booked a first class ticket for my return flight, from Miami to Z√ºrich. The Swiss First Class product is top notch, there are always issues, but they are easily forgotten if you look at the overall experience. 

One of the issues is that Star Alliance strangely enough shares the lounge in Miami with the LATAM Airline group which is associated with the OneWorld Alliance. Service is good in the lounge but it's still a bit strange.

On board cannot complaint too much, other than that the lavatories are small in size and definitely not up to First Class standards. Food is great, although I took starters as I wanted to go to bed as soon as possible. Breakfast was very nice and plenty.

Only as of July 1st Swiss will also have chauffeur service like its parent company Lufthansa has.

Superb international first class flight,Chicago,Zurich,International,"Fantastic in-flight experience with Swiss. Great seat and one of the better ones even among first class suites since I get crazy heartburn at night, and the Swiss product lets me find a comfortable slightly head-up position. Best part of the flight was the fantastic crew, who were attentive, super friendly, and genuinely warm. One of the best crews I've experienced flying in premium cabins. Contrast this to my recent Air France La Premiere flight where, despite being friendly, the flight attendants were just absent. Saw them very few times in the cabin, and my call bell remained unanswered such that I had to physically track them down in the galley to order dessert.

Food on Swiss was all right but nothing spectacular (surprisingly, BA catering still takes first prize for me on transatlantic flights because they source from Do&Co). The ground limo service for some reason did not materialize; I think they are just starting this up for the summer '18 season.

Flight cancelled with no assistance provided,Rio de Janeiro,Zurich,International,"We booked our flights with Swiss, operated by Edelweiss air. Airline sent me email while we were on holiday that our flight is cancelled. Person at the airport told us they cancel and change flights all the time. Beware that if airline does so more than 2 weeks in advance, they have no legal obligation to cover any extra costs to passengers (except amount paid for ticket or alternative flight if there is one). We had to call them many times as well as parent company Swiss Air. Our schedule was not flexible and they refused to cover changes in connecting flights we had booked separately. We had to wait 1 day at the airport for our connecting flight to Zurich.

The food served on board Swiss air flight (we have taken instead) was one of the most disgusting I've seen, only matched by American Airlines probably. The photo shows small amount of slimy pasta served with white tasteless sauce (not cheese) and few bits of frozen vegetables. No herbs, no seasoning no good ingredients. Disgraceful meal has been defined. I estimate that the whole meal platter was prepared for about 2 CHF, or about 0.2% of the price we paid for our flights. 

Avoid this airline if possible. Swiss and all it's daughter companies are providing bad service for high prices and are desperately needing more competition from Zurich Airport.

It is bad for me, so I can't imagine the torture larger people must endure.  Swiss believes if you have good entertainment on their flights and keep you busy eating you will not notice that they have shrunk everything.  The toilet is tiny, the aisles are tiny and the seats are tiny. So much so that you are strapped in with little space to move for over 12 hours, a practice that should be considered by human rights activists as travel torture.

Nice airline for a long distance economy flight!,Los Angeles,Athens,International,"Economy air travel is unpleasant, no matter what airline you use. The seats are too small, the isles are too narrow, and everyone is packed in like sardines in a can. But since I can‚Äôt afford the business class option, I look for airlines with the best possible seating situations. 

I chose to travel on Swiss Air after reading very positive reviews. All of my flights were on time, the flight attendants were accommodating, and the seats were ok. The meals were actually pretty good and the Swiss chocolate was a nice touch. 

My only complaints: First,  is the very long layover in Zurich. Maybe it is because they only have one flight out of Zurich to Athens a day - but I am not sure about that. We did take advantage of the six hour layover on the flight to Athens by taking a train into old town and spending a couple of hours there. But on the return we just wanted to get home. 

Second, the weight limit for carry-on luggage is very low. It is approximately 17 pounds. I travel very light and only take a carry-one suitcase for trips.

Disappointed,Vancouver,Florence,International,We paid Swiss Air a premium because of relatively quick transit time between Vancouver and Florence. It turned out to be anything but quick.  Endless delays missed connections etc. I could go at length but realize these things do happen when you travel. My disappoint comes from Swiss Air's complete lack of resources and strategy for dealing with these things. Particularly when their employees tell me they are common place. When you are 30 plus hours into what should have been a 13 hour trip you don't need to be told this common and asked what are you complaining about. My advice would be to give Swiss Air a pass and avoid any connections through Zurich. Likewise with the Florence airport which seems to have frequent wind issues preventing many aircraft from landing.

A LOT FOR NOT VERY MUCH!,Canton of Geneva,London,Europe,"Flying to London for a symposium meant electing to pass via Heathrow and Swiss offered a midday flight which met our needs.  For such a short flight, we booked economy but, on seeing that an upgrade to Business Class would cost a mere $55 more, we opted for a seat up front and the pleasure of a couple of drinks and a pleasant meal.  We were allocated row 1, a row which we shall avoid in future as the bulkhead wall is just in front of one's face and leg room is highly restricted.  Hand luggage must be placed in the overhead locker, putting it well out of reach. Not helpful when it contains phone, tablet and other travel essentials.
The huge shock came in terms of in-flight catering.  Alcoholic drinks are served in small shot-glasses which can just about take the contents of a miniature bottle but which leave virtually no room for any mixers.  My gin and tonic certainly scrubbed away any scales from my eyes!  Then comes the food, which must be chosen from a standard bill of fare which is common to all passengers.  There is a choice of sandwiches and salads, all of which are very cold, dry and really unappetising.  In business and regular economy, these are free of charge, but low-rice economy travellers must pay.  It is quite simple to calculate the price of such a meal: drink with mixer $6, sandwich $7, cake $3, so a total of $16 against an upcharge of $55, not to mention less legroom and limited overhead storage.  Maybe it is good, after all, to sit right up front as it allows you to disembark first.  One would expect this sort of treatment from a low-cost airline which is fundamentally more honest in not having a Business Class.  Swiss seem to be counting just a bit too much on their traditional reputation for excellence in order to push through the new master plan dreamed up by some anorexic economist locked away in an obscure basement office.

Food was terrible, I have had better food on short haul flights on budget airlines. They turned the lights down and hour and a half into the flight when it was neither night at the place I was leaving nor the place I was going to making it impossible to read or do anything that required light without having the peircing, blinding seat light on. The entertainment system, if you can call it that was old and mostly broken and the plane was small and cramped for a 12.5 hour flight! On top of all this, as a disabled individual, I had booked disability assistance and whilst it was provided it was the worst that I have ever experienced anywhere I have travelled in the world and with any airline. The amount of things I could complain about it would make this far too long but to sum it up, I was taken into a lift and my family were supposed to be meeting us at the bottom of the escalator but the assistant put me straight on the shuttle without waiting for them and then abandoned me alone in Zurich airport without any assistance to find my family and told that it was their responsibility to get me to the gate, not to ensure that I was safe with my family and refused any further assistance with finding my family or even with wifi so that I could send them a message to tell them where I was as they were looking all over the airport for me.

Pax were not individually bade farewell (normally Purser's task) - which considering the flight in general terms could not be expected......The shortcomings of this flight are the same I ""endured"" on  the last 4 business class flights to South Africa.

A great trip to Paris,Zurich,Paris,Europe,"As always a trip with the Swiss airlines is a pleasure. Never faced any problem but in the return flight (645) something happened which annoyed me...
The flight attendants probably were very hungry and they wanted to take home some sandwiches for themselves (mainly the veggie one), because when they offered snacks to the passengers starting from the front, many passengers didn't even take a sandwich... (my husband was sitting about 12 rows in front of me and he noticed that). 
Then, when they came at the back of the aircraft, the pass my row, and didn't give anything to us to eat. Then the next attendant came and offered drinks and that's when I realized that the former attendants forgot to give us the sandwich...
The couple next to me and I asked for a sandwich and they came and gave me one with meat... I told them I don't eat meat and they said...sorry we run our of cheese ones! Really, half of the plane didn't even eat... and you run out of veggie sandwiches??? Then they offered me a cous-cous salad but I refused it since it looked like vomit....

Horrible Check In Process,Athens,Zurich,Europe,"I had a multiple leg, multiple airline trip to Greece. I have flown 4 different airlines. With all other airlines, it was easy and intuitive to add bags. Swiss Air is the only one that was not easy nor intuitive. Arrived at the airport in Athens thinking I would just pay for bags at the counter. No, that would be easy and intuitive. After standing in line and getting to the counter, they sent me to another counter to pay for bags. Had to wait in that line. Then, after paid for bags, back to the other to then complete the boarding process. Well, Swiss Air is going to be a skip it in the future for me.

A poor food selection (pompously called Swiss Saveurs) is now paid for if you fly economy but that same food selection is served on business class albeit for free. No service distinction whatsoever!

Below expectations,Zurich,Singapore,International,"Long haul, 12 hour plus flight - so in business class, I have high expectations. Impressions in sequence:
Lounge. The lounge in Terminal E at Zurich is first class. Spacious, plenty of room in different seating areas and configurations, numerous food and beverage options, clean bathrooms. The weather was wet, so regrettably the outdoor deck was closed. 
Boarding. Delayed 20 minutes, departure about 30 minutes late. At 11.00 pm this is mildly irritating. Arrival in Singapore about 20 minutes late.
Seating. I was curious to see the 1-2-2/2-2-1 reverse seating configuration that elicits both positive and negative reviews. For couples wanting to sit together AND have a window view, this is one of the few options available with many airlines moving to 1-2-1 configurations, meaning that couples must sit together in the middle of the plane on wide body long haul flights. I‚Äôm still undecided. It felt constricting and enclosed and I felt slightly claustrophobic in the window seat. On the other hand, I probably had the longest duration long haul sleep for at least a decade - 8 hours out of the 12 hour flight time. (I was tired after travelling for 5 weeks and I was heading home.) We chose the smaller business class 777 cabin directly behind first class - only two rows in this micro cabin between first class and the galley. Our seats were in the second row - row 5. It seemed as though the window seats on the opposite side of the aircraft in row 4 up against the bulkhead provided more room/pitch. In any case, I‚Äôm going to forego the window seat in future.
Service. A shambles. This micro cabin is really not thought about by the cabin staff. We had to ask for a first round of drinks when it appeared that the rest of business class had been served their meal (judging by the loud bangs, rattles and clinking of crockery, cutlery and glassware from the nearby galley), dessert never arrived despite being specifically requested at the end of the main course, and we had to ask for a drinks top up part way through the meal. We must have been served at some point during the flight by every cabin attendant on the aircraft who did not seem to know or care about any requests that we had previously made. Thoroughly disappointing. I chose not to take breakfast prior to arrival, although the staff appeared more organised and efficient for this meal service.
The food. It was excellent, particularly the salmon starter with beetroot. No dessert (see above) - that‚Äôs ok, as I really didn‚Äôt need any more food! Wines were excellent as well, notably what was described as a white merlot (?).
Connections. We had a one hour connection time due to the late arrival of the flight, and the captain provided connection gate information for about 4 of these flights. Our connection was one of those mentioned and we took note. However, when we consulted the terminal information boards after disembarking, we noticed that our connecting gate lounge was different to the one advised by the captain. It was further away from our arrival gate, so we did not visit the lounge and headed directly for the departing gate. We boarded and at the very last minute a few passengers from our earlier flight arrived very annoyed and flustered - they had been waiting at the gate lounge advised by the captain on our previous flight. Not the captain‚Äôs fault, but a warning to passengers to double-check any information provided during flight when on the ground.
Overall - somewhat disappointing. I would need to travel more on Swiss to determine the optimum seat; however, due to my experience on this flight I‚Äôm not likely to choose Swiss again if there are other options available.",June 2018,"June 6, 2018",3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,,,

When I asked if I could find an earlier flight, I was told to go past immigration to a transfer desk. Just a note of apology with no form of compensation for having me wait 8 hours at Zurich airport.

The flight also serves a good lunch without extra cost. The only problem we had was one which is typical for many airlines, who allow passengers to pass boarding control before the crew has fully prepared the aircraft for boarding. So, what happened is we were taken by a bus to the door of the aircraft and left like animals for about 12-14 minutes standing in the bus until the crew allowed us to board.  When I mentioned it to a flight attendant he exclaimed ‚Äúthis is not our fault! It is the fault of the boarding gate!‚Äù  Clearly the boarding gate also is comprised of Swiss personnel and clearly, like many other airlines, they prefer to let us wait to gain a two or three minutes in boarding time than to coordinate between aircraft and gate personne to allow a seamless experience.",May 2018,"June 3, 2018",4.0,,,,,,,,

Once aboard, the cabin crew said they never heard of the free seating and began to enforce seating as about 15% aboard had assigned seats.  So the fun began with passengers moving forward and backward and repositioning their luggage as each busload of passengers arrived.  Ah, but we were not done with the fun - after we played musical chairs, the plane sat for another 15 minutes.

The most unhelpful customer service ever,Brasilia,Brussels,International,"Where to start? I bought a ticket Swiss wirh a long lay over in Rio because i know how it works over there so 2-3 hours between flights is good to do think with peace. I was changed to Edelweiss without asking any permission leaving me with an 1h40 minutes lay over. And here starts the problems: first the online check in is unavailable because as stated on the Edelweiss website with a code LX you need to check in through Swiss air website, except that on Swiss air Rio‚Äôs airport is not within the options to choose from... ( first major flow) 

At Brasilia airport they couldn‚Äôt print my tickets because there are no agreement between Latam and Swiss or Edelweiss. So you know you have 1h40 and you are flying without tickets... Then comes the funniest part; you try to call them for over 3 hours, you probably gets the whole damn service because of the number of the calls you have to make... They gave a Swiss number where no one ever picks up!!! I mean thanks for the international calls! 

And everyone is telling you don‚Äôt worry you are already registered. You then wonder if it is a bad joke or their staff is so stupid they can‚Äôt process the information...  If i‚Äôm checked in why can‚Äôt you send me my boarding cards through email? And how can‚Äôt they understand that without a boarding pass you cannot go through transit but you have to get out of the airport? The fact that i‚Äôm checked in doesn‚Äôt change the situation; I had to exist Rio‚Äôs airport to go to the check in counters to get my boarding pass to then pass all the security checks etc...  
When one of the staff member do try to help, they actually send an email without pdf with a full disclosure about what type of adobe is necessary, so pathetic!!! 

My fianc√© spent 3 hours trying to get these tickets and dealing with their extremely unhelpful and unprofessional staff. When i complained to the ground staff at Zurich airport, the woman thought she knew it better than me... Even telling me it wasn‚Äôt 3 hours, sorry for them but we have the proofs... 

Also one of their staff told my fianc√© that Swiss could not send my tickets because the booking was made through gotogate. So basically even though it is the airline, it is the agent that need to do its job! Because everyone knows that in every airports you have systems to support all the sites selling tickets on top of the ones from the airlines, yeah right... So it is as if I go to Mercedes to fix my car and they tell me they can‚Äôt because i bought it in another garage... Please

So congrats Swiss Air on your such unhelpful staff! I mean calling your services only costs me a lot of money and generated a lot of stress! But for the solution I found it alone by running like crazy in an airport! Maybe it could be helpful if they put a disclaimer on their site, stating that if the passengers want solutions they better find it themselves without calling because they only will waste time... 

Ground staff also told me that it is like that with every airlines. Sorry but it is not the same with all airlines, i do Bsb- Bru 4 to 5 times a year for 3 years now and I used all major companies you can think of without ever having a problem with online checking or tickets. As a matter of fact, my last trip was late April with KLM, amazingly they could get me my tickets in Bsb... and even better i could do my check-in online, flying first with Latam... impressive right?

Asian Vegetarian meal on Swiss,Zurich,Newark,International,"I am traveling frequently on Swiss Airlines.
I would like to make some serious comments on Asian Vegetarian meal served by Swiss  Airlines on long haul flights out of Z√ºrich.
Swiss takes pride in saying meals are prepared by Z√ºrich restaurant named Hiltl and keeps praising Hiltl in information brochure given along with the meal.
Swiss Airline‚Äôs  Asian Vegeterian meal served out of Z√ºrich is one of the worst meal on any airlines.
In the main course Hiltl serves a 65% plain white rice and the rest is a okra carrot vegetable prepared in some Awfully Tasting condiments.
Asian Vegeterian meal is mainly targeted towards Indian Vegeterians. I regret to say the meal served by Hiltl is no way close to Indian meal.All my Indian friends are complaining the same for AVML served out of Z√ºrich.
Swiss must replan  this menu with help one well known Indian chef and get it served out of Z√ºrich and if necessary replace Hiltl if they can not adapt and follow.
Thank you for listening Swiss Airlines and we would appreciate your response.",May 2018,"May 31, 2018",4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,,,
Never again,Sydney,St. Petersburg,International,"I have flown with many airlines but this would have to be the most uncomfortable.  Yes, we were travelling over 30 hours with 3 stops but that doesn't change the fact that the seats were hard and narrower than most and the meals were average.  I am only just over 5 foot but I found it hard to cross my legs in an attempt to change to a more comfortable seating position.  My husband commented on how comfortable and wide the seats felt in Singapore Airlines after changing planes in Singapore.  We used Swiss from Singapore to Zurich, Zurich to  
St Petersburgh and then Moscow to Zurich, Zurich to Singapore for the return flights.  Be aware, .....Swiss Airlines (domestic) WILL  weigh your bags and if they do not fit in the metal holder, they WILL be your carry on bag in the hole.  Although we were carrying NO extra items and only had ONE carry on bag between two people and it weighed less than 7 kgs and we had 30 hours of travelling in front of us, the cabin crew took our bag and booked it through to Australia.

The transfer in Zurich airport between the London flight and Sao Paulo flight was easy in both directions - a train connects the E gates where the intercontinental flights are with the D gates where the London flights are. In the train one is entertained by typical Swiss sounds including cowbells, an alpine horn and a cow. 
In flight service was friendly and efficient on all the flights, and food good - in particular I enjoyed range of Swiss wines available as these are not easily found outside Switzerland.

However the crew was unprofessional anyway. Boarding commenced 10 minutes prior scheduled departure. So for sure 300 + passengers were not seated when the plane should leave the gate.  So the crew started to yell to passengers to move faster to their seats and take a place. Very funny if you keep in mind, that you can‚Äôt pass anyone standing on the aisle due to the configuration.
So the flight started badly already.
It does not become better when they serve food. They made a whole service even departure was at midnight. None of the crew members was able to speak in an adequate level to the passenger nor even had eye contact. Just rude and unpolite. It remembers on former LH times. However they have improved significantly.

Its really hard to say...,Zurich,D√ºsseldorf,Europe,"on one hand, Swiss airlines are well serviced and maintained, updated, and safe - and that's why I can recommend the airline with 4 Stars. I will therefore always choose Swiss over another airline if I can - even though they are really expensive. Service on-board is also friendly, well trained and smooth - professional, formal  Swiss hospitality.

On the other side, service before and after the flight: horrendous, unacceptable, frustrating and painful. Some of the things that I encounter over and over again (I'm flying once a week):
- seat change at gate (even though I paid extra for an exit seat) to any seat
- no online checking possible for code share partners incl checkin machines
- loooooong queues at checkin/baggage drop with very few counters open
- Swiss App works about 50% of the time (sometimes I receive my App Boarding Pass 2 days after the flight)
- Call Centre agents: no clue about flights booked on Swiss but operated byu others (""you have to call Lufthansa, I cannot help you"")
- Miles&More really only makes sense if you have monthly business class tickets (I'm flying Swiss 2x per month for 2 years - still haven't reached Silver) and I'm always booking super-flex tariff (Y-class)
- regardless of your booking class, ticket changes (date) are chargeable

Swissair still shines,Zurich,Boston,International,"Swissair has always stood for the kind of hospitality you expect from the Swiss - genuine, eager to help and a bit dated in a comforting kind of way. This flight was no different with one exception - I had purchased a ""premium"" meal and a half bottle of wine for about $40. Not surprisingly, it wasn't on board. I asked to speak with the Purser who sent a message to the base in Zurich that confirmed it hadn't been boarded, and what's more they had no record of it despite the receipt I printed. What happened next would only happen on an airline like Swiss.

The flight was extremely crowded and so there were no business class entrees available to serve to me. The Purser came back to me and said she'd find me something but I had to wait until everyone had chosen their meals. Seemed like a reasonable approach. As it turned out she was able to deliver me the business class appetizer of smoked salmon tartare, and the first class veal tenderloin with wine from one of the cabins in a real glass. Bravo Swissair.

A couple things to know - they still operate A340s which have no power at the seats and are somewhat tired looking on the inside. The other is if you're a Star Alliance Gold member (United etc) you can use the Swiss lounges which have great food and drink (they use Lufthansa's lounge in Boston).

A learning experiance.,Zurich,Prague,Europe,"We were on vacation trying to get from Basel to Prague.  Swiss Air has a program to take a train from Basel to Zurich then a plane to Prague (this also applies to multiple other destinations).  This is booked together through Swiss Air.  What I didn't read in the fine print is you can take any train that day.  Also in the fine print they will pick up your luggage at your Lodging for an extra charge and check it in on your flight.  The train ride takes about an hour and half and is very scenic. Some trains make more stops than other trains.

What they didn't explain is this train is an economy/commuter train.  There were more tickets sold then seats.  The cars did not have any space for luggage except for overhead bins.  People were standing in the aisle or in the area between the cars.  Also there was no explanation that the train goes to the Zurich train station and you have to take another train to the airport.

If I were to do it again it would be less stressful as I would not have to spend a significant amount time trying navigate the trip.  I would definitely upgrade to first class on the train portion of the trip.  But I am not sure how or if you can upgrade to first class with out having to upgrade the flight to first class.

Seating was the typical 3:3 leather Europe Club Economy style layout with the middle seat left vacant and a table placed over the squab. This enables the airline to move the barrier along the aircraft separating BC and Economy depending on the number of BC passengers flying

As soon as I settled down, I realized that my screen did not work. I signaled it to the flight attendants and got the promise to react as soon as the flight took off. After an hour and my new complaint, another steward came and offered me to change the seat. The offered place was much worse, in the middle and far from my friends with whom I traveled. Since I refused a replacement, I could no longer complain. They tried to cheer me up, they tried to be humorous and polite more than with others, but I already had enough!

She verbal communication was defensive and had a lecturing tone.; as cold as the Swiss glacier water! Actually re reminded me of Frau Blucher in the movie Young Frankenstein.(A movie worthwhile watching)

My recommendation to her would be to remember that the passenger is always (almost) right. The passenger does not need to be lectured. After all, its me who pays her wages!

Then I saw the reason - a master steward was on board testing and training the crew and it worked miracles. The way to Athens was lame, unfriendly and with dry sandwiches. Here it worked and - wow - it felt like back in the 80¬¥s when flying even eco was still fun.

While others seem to reverse the trend a bit, for an average guy like me (5'10) it's virtually impossible to sleep because my knees bump into the sharp edges of the seat in front of me. No power at the seat.  No way to open a small (13"") laptop when front seat is laid back. Poor food (both the chicken and the pasta).  Old plane (A340).  On the ZRH E gate they managed to have 2 big flights to board on opposite gates at the same time, creating boarding chaos.  On top of that a security firm that performs extra searches with incompetent personnel.

Luckily the kind gentleman sitting next to us agreed to move to a window seat so that we could sit together.

Which meant that as we were sitting on the last row of business class, there were no options that were suitable for my pregnant wife. There were actually no options even on the menu for the starter that were not raw. The crew didnt come up with a solution so we had to ask the them if there were any suitable options in 1st class. Once we had asked again the cabin crew manager came to see us and apologised to us. She also got my wife a soup from 1st class.

A long weekend in India,Canton of Geneva,Mumbai,International,"Decided to fly with Swiss instead of AF for once in order to fly with my friends 
Check in in Geneva was easy and on Wednesday morning definitely not busy. But due to a misunderstanding with the lady that check us in, we ended with seats that were not was we were expecting. I asked the lady in the lounge. It was difficult but at the end we managed to get our seat selected 24h ago (23h hours should I say with Swiss ) ...beginning wasn‚Äôt that smooth!
Transit in Zurich is easy and efficient as few people. The terminal for international flights is in the middle of the airport with a terrasse all around. Quite nice I would say to get fresh air and look at planes taking off or landing. Lounge is ok, but choice of newspapers and magazines is rather quite limited as well as the food choice. (AF lounges are ahead by at least two notches )
Boarding was ok but they would gain efficiency by setting up clear lines. Nevertheless it went smoothly 
Seats are quite old and screen small (my iPad screen is bigger !) compared to new business seats at AF, British Airways and Lufthansa. Choice of film is rather quite limited too. Old seats but allow you to have a real flat bed if needed. 
The amenities kit (made in cooperation with Victorinox) offered on the way to Mumbai is composed of a small pocket and on the way back to Zurich of a metal box which could be re-used to put pencils. I prefer the kit offered on the way to Mumbai as small grey pocket in tissue , nit, solid and in a nice grey color. I like the red socks üòé in it
Food: good but nothing out of the extraordinary. Plus the tray and plates,.. are not in line with the business standing. We could think we are at the cantine ! They have to improve this. Bread could be improved. ( on point : Croissants offered in the flights from Geneva to Zurich and Zurich to Geneva are either not fresh or were kept in a far too cold area. Quite dry and Not testy.). The omelette for the breakfast on my way back to Zurich from Mumbai was perfectly cooked and tasty. 
Staff is nice, available and ready to help each time you ask something. Both time, on the way out and in. 
Overall impression is that everything went smoothly but level remains one notch below what AF has to offer for the same price. 
two big differences nevertheless: Swiss crew are rarely on strike if never so highly likely you will reach your destination without much hurdles and Paris CDG hub can be sometime quite messy even if I have to confess some improvements have been made those last few years but more needs to be done",May 2018,"May 17, 2018",3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,,,

Swiss offer two flights a day direct from Birmingham to Zurich, one at either end of the day. The planes are usually full but mainly with business people. The service is almost always on time and onboard there is alway complementary hot and cold drinks and a croissant - oh yes and an individual mini bar of luscious Swiss chocolate on take-off and landing.

In Birmingham the plane is usually on a stand quite close to the departure hall and in Zurich it is often parked a distance away but departure gate is again close by and a bus ferries passengers out.

Perfect flight - almost,Zurich,Tel Aviv,International,"I flew to TLV last week in C class. As always it was an excellent flight. Seat great (7K), food as well. But this time I have to point out that one flight attendant seemed to have a bad day. I don't like to name people on the net as this will be my first time but Mrs. Hurt was beyond my imagination of being friendly and up to the service level Swiss usually provides. She was rude, rolled her eyes and was quite harsh in her tone. Not only to me but to other passengers as well. She complained in the galley about ""the crowd"" on the flights to Tel Aviv. It has happened the first time to me that an attendant has shown such an attitude. And I simply insisted on my Kosher meal which I ordered in advance. But she said very harsh that I wasn't on the list and therefore did not put a sheet on my table for lunch. When she and her colleague came around for service her colleague wanted to prepare my table but  Mrs. Hurt turned to her and said that I didn't want to eat.

In the past I have always found Swiss to be of better quality than your average European or American Airline. Not quite as good as the Asian or Middle Eastern carriers (Emirates, JAL, Korean, Singapore, Cathay) but still solid. 

Lately I find they are slipping:

Customer service in the US is still mediocre. Ability to reach someone and get someone on the phone who knows what is going on is terrible. 

Miles & More webpages and reporting is mediocre. Intransparent and just generally as user unfriendly as something like this can be. Shouldn't be that hard. milage account numbers change, account security is clumsy, transparency is screwed up. 

Ground staff (both in New York and in Zurich) is clueless. No announcements on delayed flights until passengers reach the gate. staff in the lounges are clueless as well. They have an attitude and focus more on how many devices are allowed to use the wifi per passenger than on trying to help make passengers feel welcome.

What were Swiss Airlines thinking?,Zurich,Miami,International,"Travelling to Miami from Zurich on March 30th, to commence a family holiday in The Bahamas, I had been looking forward to the flight with Swiss. I have used Swiss Airlines many times, to travel to the UK, South Africa and parts of Europe. I live in Switzerland and have, where possible, checked out Swiss first of all for my trips. They are usually dependable, punctual and the service is good. 
Imagine my shock, therefore, when my family and I took this flight to Miami. The Airbus A330 was full, it was the holiday period. However, my main criticism was the layout adopted for this route. In economy, there were no toilet facilities at the rear of the aircraft. Instead, there was a huge galley. This meant that the four toilets, situated midway in the aircraft, two in each aisle, were constantly blocking the route to and from the other part of the cabin for the crew and anyone else. The crew jealously guarded their galley area with a heavy curtain/screen. I have never, in 45 years of air travel, encountered such an inconvenient aircraft layout. Even two toilets at the rear would have been a blessing. 
Furthermore and unusually, the meals loaded at Zurich were next to inedible. Now, I‚Äôm quite used to airline food from all manner of airlines and, unlike many, quite look forward to what is being served. This service really disappointed and the vegetarian option ran out before it reached us but seeing as it was ‚Äúpasta with pineapple chunks‚Äù that may have been a blessing. 
The crew were efficient and pleasant but, overall, the flight left me questioning whether I will use Swiss for my forthcoming trips to South Africa, which is a direct flight or use Etihad or Emirates which entail a stop.",March 2018,"May 9, 2018",2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,

I felt that I had been dumped at Zurich airport, without the assistance of the airline on arriving at Zurich airport.

Swiss hospitality,Zurich,London,Europe,"I travelled on Swiss International Airlines from Zurich to London Heathrow in March 2018. 

I‚Äôd taken the train from Oerlikon to Zurich Airport which only takes a few minutes. Swiss check in desks are located in the airport train station, which was a quick and easy way to check in my suitcase and get my boarding pass printed. 

LOUNGES

My flight was departing from one of the D Gates and whilst the lounge was fine, it was crowded, relatively small and lacking in occasion. 

As there was still 90 minutes befor my flight, I decided to venture out to Swiss‚Äô flagship lounge in the E Gates, which involves taking a train. If you‚Äôre familiar with Heathrow, think of the train between T5A and T5B albeit with video and sound effects! 

The lounge agents were surprised to see me, although I explained I‚Äôd read about the E lounge terrace and was keen to see it in person! I was given a puzzled expression but was told it wasn‚Äôt a problem! 

The E lounge is best reviewed elsewhere - and with various pictures - however, I thought it was great, in particular the terrace overlooking one of the runways. The bright sunny clear weather helped as did the Leica binoculars! 

The drinks selection was the same as the D lounge, although I stuck to still and sparkling water. There was a greater variety and quantity of food. One of the centre pieces by of the lounge is an open Chef‚Äôs kitchen which makes food to order. This included (amongst other things) wok fried vegetables, dim sum and pasta. I had some fresh pasta with tomato sauce and grated cheese - basic but tasty. 

A couple of tips from anything thinking of doing the same: when you arrive at the W Gates keep heading up until you reach the concourse. My mistake was to confuse the arrows for straight on instead of upwards.....! You will need to take a train back and go through security - it was very quick on this trip but give yourself plenty of time. 

Departure was from gate D31. I waited a few minutes for boarding, but it wasn‚Äôt worth going back to the D lounge. Boarding was late due to late arrival of the aircraft, but I was onboard for 18:25. As it was a completely full flight Swiss were offering to check-in additional bags free of charge. The aircraft was an Airbus A320 in Star Alliance livery. 

ONBOARD EXPERIENCE

I was in seat 1A. I think this is a good seat as it has two windows, extra legroom and is usually the first to be served. By comparison, 1C is very close to the galley and subject to all of the aisle traffic. 

Unlike my outbound flight, there was no water or refreshing towelette on my seat, but both were offered from a basket once everyone was onboard. 

Door 1L was closed at 18:52 and take off was a few minutes later with good views over the city and Lake Zurich in the distance. 

A light meal was served on a tray. No menus were offered (so I can‚Äôt be precise) but it comprised a small plate of seared tuna with vegetables, two types of Swiss cheese and a small cheesecake like dessert in a glass pot. It was pretty tasty, but I‚Äôd suggest eating in the lounge beforehand if you‚Äôre hungry. I‚Äôm glad I did. Bread rolls were offered twice. The crew were proactive with drinks and I managed a couple of glasses of champagne and Swiss red wine during the flight - the latter being surprisingly good. I was never offered tea or coffee; perhaps it came round when I was using the bathroom. 

ARRIVAL

Landing was at 19:18 UK time. My bags were quick to arrive with the priority tags intact. 

In summary, this was another great Swiss short haul flight with a very good ground experience and level of onboard service. Constructive thoughts: in the absence of printed menus, it would be good if the crew could proactively (very briefly) explain what you‚Äôre eating. WiFi would also be a nice addition.

"Average, but too warm!",Boston,Zurich,International,"I get that Swiss culture doesn‚Äôt include copious amounts of air conditioning but is it too much to ask to have the air vents on an 8 hour flight?
Overall the flight was no better or worse than any other I‚Äôve taken but the fact that I couldn‚Äôt get a little air blowing made the trip very uncomfortable. I‚Äôll likely look for another carrier on my next trip over.",April 2018,"May 4, 2018",3.0,,,,,,,,
I love their Business Class,Zurich,Montreal,International,"The Business class lounge in Zurich provides excellent breakfast and was convenient for this flight.  Preboarding was congested due to passport checks prior to cueing to embark.  The business cabin has 2 areas, rows 4 and 5 are by themselves between the  1st class cabin and the main business class cabin. Rows 4 and 5 are definitely preferable if you can get them. Meal service was excellent and my John Dory fish selection was moist and not over cooked. Movie selections were varied and the seats very spacious and comfortable.",May 2018,"May 3, 2018",5.0,,,,,,,,
Favourite Airline,Zurich,Johannesburg,International,"Again I had a very pleasant flight with SWISS. The staff is very friendly and warm. This overnight flight included a delicious dinner (with salad, cheese and desert) and a breakfast. Drinks are refilled as wanted. And to keep warm and cosy every seat had a blanket and a pillow ready. Of course the legroom in economy is not great but I nevertheless was able to catch a few hours of sleep.",May 2018,"May 3, 2018",4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

One of my favourites,Hong Kong,Zurich,International,"An over 12 hours Swiss International Airlines Boeing 777-300ER (LX139) flight journey from Hong Kong to Zurich:

The business class seat was of medium soft fabric material with a leather headrest; with massage function; at a touch button control converting into reclining chair and a flat bed. There were a cushion and a blanket provided. The flat bed was sufficient for an average height adult but rather tight for width.

The storage at reachable level, other than the overhead tray, was sufficient.

Since this flight took off just before midnight, I had a cup of camomile tea, skipped both quick meal and dinner for a good night sleep.

It was not easy to have a sound sleep on a  full business class flight, but with its adjustable eye mask, seat belt on top of the blanket across my body, I managed an eight hour undisturbed close eyes.
 
Breakfast was served with a good spread of food and drinks. It was hard to fault their delicious cold cut of meat and cheeses. Their bread was equally delicious.

The plane touched down Zurich at 6:19 am, only 9 minutes behind the schedule, doing pretty me for a long haul flight.

Plus points: Quality food, drinks and toiletries, clean cabin, comfortable temperature, almost prompt departure and arrival time.

Negatives: Narrow width flat bed; short of attentiveness; asking me to go back to my seat while another flight stewardess standing in the way; and returning my jacket to another passenger at the final hour before arrival.

In general, it was uneventful and for the fair rest and delicious food, I would have given LX 139; 5/5 rating but taking account of its short of attentiveness, a very good was justified.

Swiss International is one of my favourite premium airlines, I will fly with them again.",May 2018,"May 2, 2018",4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,,,
Very inconsistent,Paris,Zurich,Europe,"Swiss delivers inconsistent service, I recently had several flights with them in various flight class, unfortunately not all flights were satisfactory. My last flight from Paris to Zurich was really disappointing. The check in was a disaster, not only that all went wrong, but what worries me most is they are arrogant and do miss client orientation. And if you want to complain they ask you to do it online instead of speaking to you. Also lounge staff and staff on board were not very friendly but more arrogant. Overall an unsatisfactory experience.

 I once read an article here that stated if something goes wrong there is lack of client orientation, and I must say I agree. In addition they don't care if you are a good customer or not (my star alliance gold status is very often completely ignored). It is a pity as sometimes they really deliver excellent service (see my previous report on a first class flight), if they were more consistent they could really be one of the top airlines.",May 2018,"May 2, 2018",2.0,,,,,,,,
Splendid Swiss Service,Montreal,Bordeaux,International,"Some of the best onboard treatment I have ever gotten to receive from altitudes going way high-in-the-sky.  A relatively unknown-by-name airline where I usually can expect my departure from (YEG), though will definitely be recommending as one lead choice in business service, Swiss Air was impeccable with quite possibly the friendliest service I have experienced in a very long time (both on-or-off the ground).  The aircraft itself was pleasant in comfort & design, & both the regular as well as the special lacto-oco vegetarian meals were nearly perfect in what you‚Äôd expect from actual restaurant availability.  A bonus point goes toward having quite the rather large selection of beverage options available with the emphasis for Swiss products which I thought was a nice little touch worth mentioning.  Bravo all-around & overall.  Thanks!!",April 2018,"May 2, 2018",5.0,,,,,,,,
NEVER FLY ON THEIR airbus A330 OR A300 AIRPLANE,Zurich,Newark,International,"OMG never but never will I fly with their airbus 330 airplane. The seats were so jammed closely together that when the girl in front of me leaned back, her head was practically in my lap! The screens were not sharp and it was very difficult to enjoy the movie. That said, the service of the stewardesses was very good. They came instantly when I pushed the button, always found a solution to the passengers' problems, and were very efficient. So I WOULD fly Swiss again, but just not on that horrible airplane again. It pays to ask your travel agent what kind of plane you will be having (yes, he can see it on his computer).

Ok flight for a European airline,Singapore,London,International,"SWISS was one of the better European airlines that I have flown. However, it was much worse than many Asian airlines that I have flown.

For the long-haul flights from Singapore to Zurich and back, the seat was a bit narrow (3-4-3 seating in a Boeing 777-300ER). However, they were very comfortable. The legroom was good. Because of the good design, I was able to straighten my legs even in a middle seat. The touchscreen IFE was easy to use and clear. However, the movie selection was very limited. The food selection was limited (a meat and a vegetarian choices for dinner and only one choice for breakfast). The taste was good but the portion was small. A small piece of Swiss cheese was offered even in economy, which was a nice touch. The meal service was quite slow. The service was not as warm as in Asian airlines but right to the point. Whenever I asked for something, they would always get back to me with it (sometimes after a while).

The transit at Zurich airport was very efficient. The short-flights from Zurich to Heathrow and back were ok. The food was standard for a European airline: a sandwich or a bread and some drinks.",April 2018,"May 2, 2018",3.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2.0

Third, somehow, they're able to make airplane food enjoyable. Gluten free beer was a nice surprise onboard.

Excellent service,San Francisco,Zurich,International,"I always enjoy flying Swiss: compared to many other airlines, the service is more professional and the on-time arrival record (in my own experience) is better.

This is the first time I have flown with Swiss Air and I really enjoyed my flights. The flight crew were very friendly and helpful, and the food was great. 

If I had a few complaints, it would be the entertainment system. I have flown a lot of international flights recently and some airlines have amazing in-flight entertainment and some airlines have free wi-fi. The entertainment system was very outdated and there wasn't much in the way of selection choice. But apart from that, everything else was exceptional. The other complaint was the lady who served us at the Swiss Airlines counter. She advised us that we had to check in one of our carry-on bags. Her excuse she that was instructed by Swiss Air to do this as the flight was full, and there was very little overhead bag space left. We are not sure why she said this to us, as the flight was far from full and there was a lot of space left in the overhead space, even after we placed our bag up there.

small things add up to big problems if you don't pay attention,Shanghai,Zurich,International,"We had a family emergency that necessitated booking a flight on Swiss International from Shanghai to London - via Zurich.  We've only flown LX one time in the past and it wasn't so bad... but that was with some planning and we were able to get upgraded to Business.  This time we were in Economy and the experience was not the same.

First - here are the GOOD things about the flight:

- It was (for the most part) very smooth...but that's the weather and not the airline
- The cabin of the plane was incredibly clean - for an older plane (A340-300) the seats, between the seats, the overhead bins, the lavatories... any place you could see or touch - immaculately clean.
- The seats weren't too bad.  It was a family emergency - so we had to take what we could get and for it being Economy the seats were comfortable and the recline angles were decent enough to rest with no problems.
- The crew were all very courteous and professional

(So far you've read this and wondered - what else could there be to diminish your feelings about this fine/proud flag carrier?)

Well...

- There was no wifi.  In 2018 is it really such a big deal to put wifi in place on a 12 hour flight?  As a contingency, the inflight magazine outlines how you can access data on your phone or tablet from terrestrial antenna ...but only one TWO kinds of aircraft - and not the A340.  :(
- The inflight entertainment was pretty good... until you tried to switch it off - you can't really switch it off.  You can take everything from the screen, but it is still being backlit.  Again, on a 12 hour flight it would have been nice shut the screen off completely.
- there are no power outlets to charge your phone or tablet in-flight.  Again, in 2018 this is a necessity for most travelers - a sad but true fact is that people's lives are growing more and more power hungry.  That lust for power has to wait until you land on an LX flight.

and now for the one thing that was almost very problematic for me
- I ordered a special meal on both legs of our family's journey.  From PVG - ZRH the meal was perfect:  fresh, tasty and for the fact that it was a vegan meal (and that vegan meals are usually quite 'blah') even imaginative.   SADLY on the leg from ZRH back to PVG it was NOT a vegan meal and instead a vegetarian meal.  The difference between those two things being one has milk and cheese and the other doesn't.  That is a critical error for a person who can't digest dairy - ESPECIALLY on a 12 hour flight.

The good news is that I saw the error and was able to 'adjust' my meal to prevent getting and upset stomach at 37,000 feet.  The bad news is that the way I adjusted the meal was to avoid eating half of what was served.

It is a small detail - a tiny detail.  But for however small a detail it is - getting it wrong meant the potential for a very unpleasant flight - for me.

For a potential flyer on LX:  call and call AGAIN to make sure that they get the message about your EXACT meal preference.

For anyone from LX reading this:  reinforce to your teams that even a small difference (imperceptible to most people who it doesn't effect directly - especially in such a strong dairy culture (no pun intended) as Switzerland) can mean the difference between a ""VERY GOOD"" rating (what you would have received), and only ""AVERAGE"" ( what you got instead.)",April 2018,"April 25, 2018",3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,2.0

Swiss Airlines service not so Swish,Manchester,Johannesburg,International,"I recently travelled to Johannesburg on Swiss airlines in business class. As my wife had an injury to her knee and transfer time at Zurich was very short we requested a wheel chair or preferably motorised buggy. We were told that a wheelchair can be organised. However when we arrived at Zurich no wheelchair was available. So we had to walk to Gate E for internatioal transfer.
On the return leg the seat no 5 A and B had one slot for shoes for both of us. There was only magazine holder for two of us and that was so cramped one would require a bit of strength to extricate the magazines.
My wife had a salad and fish and was violently sick following morning.
I asked for a gin and tonic but was told that they have run out tonic water however after a bit of remonstration the drink arrived though belatedly.
The dinner menu very expensively produced mentioned that the a choice of desserts would be available from trolley. However only one dessert was available with no choice.
The business  class lounge at Manchester and Johannesburg was a poor cousin to Emirates sumptuous offering.

After approximately an hour, the pilot told us that we had to be diverted to Stanstead airport, 50 miles north of London and said it would take 20 minutes. We kept flying for about an hour without any further explanation....As we lander there were no stairs to get off the plane and we we got them there was no bus....The whole time no announcement from the steward to let us know what was going on.....

"""Your seat has changed"" - the typical Swiss email",Zurich,Palma de Mallorca,Europe,"LX2150 is anyway a flight to avoid as it is very often late, esp. when the rotation before is ZRH-DUB-ZRH which Swiss is unable to execute without delay. And what upsets me even more is that they charge you for a seat reservation and then send you an email that because of aircraft change, they have reassigned you - even if this is a complete lie as was the case on 17 April when they again at the gate reassigned me for a second time - by one row as they were too lazy to move the curtain between business and economy.

Took a while tomget the flight loaded as everyone seemed to be searching for overhead locker space.

My Personal Favourite Airline,Zurich,Hong Kong,International,"How can I begin? Our flight with Swiss was arguably one of the best economy class experiences in the skies. We took off from Zurich bound for Hong Kong at about 10pm local time aboard one of Swiss' brand-new 777-300ERs. The dinner was served promptly and featured an incredibly satisfying meal that you'll find on any Lufthansa Group flight. The entertainment on board was fantastic. A great selection of films and tv series meant I was kept amused throughout the flight. Also I must mention the in-flight maps. There were so many to browse through, giving all sorts of details, keeping an aviation geek like myself, very happy. The seats were comfortable and the blanket definitely helped me get off to sleep. Even as a 6-footer I had enough room to stretch out since I was seated next to an aisle.

Even with a full load, the plane took off like a rocket. The 2/3 configuration is pleasing. The aircraft is as roomy as the Boeing 737 or the Airbus equivalents.The ZIM seats seem to be slimmer than the ones on Boeing or Airbus planes and feel more comfortable with good pitch, not much personal storage space, however. The overhead compartments on both sides accepts the standard on-board luggage cases. Finally no more in-seat entertainment screens. Guess, most people use their own smart phones or pads.Only tiny 2 1/4 x 3 3/4 displays in ceiling over the window seats for ""Fasten seat belt"" and ""No smoking"" messages.

SWISS Business Class - Business Class.,Los Angeles,Zurich,International,"I flew on Swiss across to Zurich as a code share with united. You will know form my other reviews that i am a big fan of the United Polaris service which they have introduced and so I was a little skeptical about being bumped onto SWISS.

I did not need to be - SWISS is very - well Swiss, it is a beautiful manifestation of everything that the Swiss brand is, super high quality without being showy, everything you need beautifully efficiently delivered, without any noise or fan fare. It reminded me just how subtly high quality the Swiss are. Understated luxury.

As i sat in the little seating pod it reminded me a little of the interior of an Audi car, I find those upon first impression a bit tight, slightly cramped, but then you realize as you settle into it that they are perfectly proportioned and supremely well thought through. The seat is comfortable - although i had a weird experince where my seat kept inflating - there is a setting in the seat which allows you to make it harder or softer via a button in the arm rest, for some reason my seat wanted to help me have it at maximum inflation all the time - that was the only problem i had the whole time.

I like that the arm rest comes down it creates a lot more space when you are in the flat bed pose, the blankets and bedding, again without all the Saks of 5th branding or Partnership with Westin as you get on American carriers was lovely, like really lovely. I put my head in the pillow and remember thinking - wow, now this is just what i want to sink into, that feeling of beautiful, Swiss luxury. 

The Personal video collection was great, a large screen with a very impressive array of content - perhaps the best i have seen in fact especially if you are interested in films from other cultures, whereas American Carriers will major on US authored content the Swiss have a good selection of Asian, European Art House and Bollywood movies to complement the normal Hollywood fair.

Food - well I was flying from LAX to Swizerland and i think i suffered as a result of that. I got a menu which was for the Swiss to LAX flight and it looked awesome - salamis from La Valais, traditional Swiss cheeses and really thoughtful dishes, i suspect that they have not quite managed to get the same mojo going the other way - the food was probably the least impressive part of the service - I ordered a cup of Cheese and Broccoli soup, it felt like i was consuming some kind of artificially thickened MSG laden gloop, bland and flavourless. I ordered the beef it was 'soggy' soggy steak is horrible, it feels like it has been hanging around, if you are going to serve steak on a plane then make it decent, otherwise serve Pork or Chicken and avoid the trap of serving bad steak. The Cheeses - which i really had high hopes for - were either hard in the case of the mountain cheese or rubbery in the case of the Brie.

I personally dont really go on planes for the food - if it is not good then i am happy to forego it, but if food is important to you on a flight then you might be disappointed here.

But generally I found it an impeccable flight - service was thoughtful and careful, and the journey was restful.

No pajamas though - apparently you only get them in First Class, so my United Polaris Experience still comes out on top -",April 2018,"April 22, 2018",5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,2.0
Good quality of service,London,Tokyo,International,Our first experience of Swiss business class (we also did the return LX 161 flight with connecting fights to LHR via Zurich).  In most respects our experience was very good.  Just a couple of points to note so that next time it will be excellent.  There are 3 types of long haul business class seat and we seemed to get different seats from those previously booked (i.e. not so good).  Unfortunately the seats we got were not ideal - the person in the window seat has to clamber over their companion - but seem to be in the minority so you will probably only find yourself stuck with these if you are unlucky (and we did get our preferred pre-booked seats for our return flight).  I am gluten intollerant and like with many other airlines the standard of catering is never up to scratch whatever class you travel (e.g. BA 1st class is also poor on this front).  You never get a choice (and you never know what you are getting) and the food is often very bland.  Swiss was no exception on this front unfortunately - I think they ought to look at how they cater for business class special diets as it could be made a unique selling proposition.  Our other grouse is that for inexplicable reasons you have to go through security procedures again at Zurich even though you are in transit - this means that if you have bought duty free liquor it would be confiscated.  Swiss NEVER warn you about this - which is a serious omission (but my companion had previously transited Zurich so was wised up).  Apart from these negatives (and the business lounge at Zurich being a bit small/overcrowded)  we were very satisfied: the crew were very attentive and we felt that it was certainly worth the price we paid for the extra standard of comfort (and the priority baggage off load at the destination).  We booked the seats because they represented excellent value for the price paid and we were not disappointed on this front so would consider Swiss Business Class again for another long haul flight if convenient.,March 2018,"April 21, 2018",5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0
Better last year ....,Florence,Newark,International,"The lounge at Zurich airport, WiFi did not work and the staff could not help me either. Another passenger was having the same issue. They need to staff at least one IT guy in there. The lounge itself is gorgeous, totally 5 stars. The flight from Florence to Zurich was full. Even though I was a Gold Star Alliance member, no upgrade or nothing. Very disappointed. From Zurich to NY, one flight attendant dropped food on my lap when serving the breakfast, and she said, ""oops, sorry, but nothing happened, no spill, no leak, so you are ok"", then walked away. The passenger sitting next to me looked at me and said ""wow"", and yes I felt the same. I simply returned the food without touching them. The aircraft itself is ok, the flight was on time, and my checked-in luggage came out from the belt so quickly, thanks to the Gold member card.

Cabin crew: excellent - company's policy on transparancy of booking class needs urgent review,Athens,Luxembourg,Europe,"It was my understanding, and up to a certain point of time my belief, that Swiss, one of the best carriers diachronically speaking, employed a clear and transparent policy as per the booking class of its tickets, namely to inform potential pax, before a ticket was issued, whether its booking class is eligible for mileage accrual or not.

Used to be better,Los Angeles,Zurich,International,"I have been flying with Swiss on this same route up to 3 times per year for the last 30 years.

Prices are still premium ($1,600 round trip in economy) but the service overall is getting worse. Before Swiss was part of Lufthansa it was a lot more personable and flexible, allowed last minute upgrades with miles or good deals of upgrades for purchase at the counter when business class was not full. All this is gone. Big corporate took over and all the little things that made Swiss so special have disappeared. 
You should think that for the high economy price they serve at least a decent meal but not so anymore. The pasta was overcooked, the salad of the poorest quality with a ""pudding"" dressing not necessarily liked by Swiss people and instead of a dessert there were Oreo cookies that seamed to come stright out of a chemical plant. At least for dinner they still serve with real silverware. But then for breakfast you get a carton box full of packaged goods plus plasitc knife and spoon.

Never fly Swiss,London,Lugano,Europe,"In summary, I can effort the cost, Swiss cannot effort losing me and people like me as business passenger!
It all started yesterday arriving to London after a two weeks business trip in South and North America, happily  using American Airlines, British Airways, LATAM and even Aerolineas Argentinas.
An arrogant Swiss agent name: chalion Braganca in LHR did not have enough experience, knowledge or brain cells to understand that I cannot run the risk of traveling to Lugano to a board meeting without my suite and tie and that is why I have to travel with my small piggy bag on board. He really placed me between a rock and a hard place. Had no choice but to take the risk of arriving at 7:00 pm to Lugano without my documents and my suite (one can be executed for arriving to a board meeting without a suite and a tie in Switzerland...)
Today when I am arriving to check in, on my way back to London, an un pleasant lady behind the counter made me pay CHF 45.00 for the ‚Äúaccess weight‚Äù (on the same piggy bag) and once I paid the sum- the security risk is gone.

A bit disappointing,Zurich,Singapore,International,"I flew to Zurich from Singapore with Singapore Airlines and everything was top-notch. I knew Swiss wasn't quite up to that standard, but I was still disappointed. The only reason why I choose to fly back with Swiss is the timing, as the SQ return flight is a day flight and I'm usually super jet-lagged after that. Still, I was looking forward to the flight. But then it didn't start of well. Check-in was slow, the lady didn't really know what she was doing and had to ask a colleague for help. This should not happen at a business counter. The lounge in Zurich is pretty nice though. The service on the flight itself was very different from what I experienced with SQ the week before. The staff never addressed us by our names for example and the lady who served my drink just pulled out the table and started preparing for dinner, obstructing my view as I was watching a movie. I know they have to do disturb you while doing so, but a pre-warning or even a short excuse would have been in order I think. It just seemed loveless, getting the job done no matter what. Not very pleasant. Also, I felt like the staff doesn't turn down the volume when speaking to other passengers at night, when others are sleeping. That's probably why you get oropax! Which brings my to my next point, the travel/amenity kit. This was very nice! A beautiful pouch from Victorinox with a toothbrush and toothpaste, lip balm, a sleep mask and oropax.

SWISS B777 most terrible long-haul flight in economy,Zurich,Los Angeles,International,"The aircraft B777-ER itself was relatively new and the interior design appealing, also the entertainment system in economy was high quality. Still, the flight experience on the long-haul flight from ZRH to LAX was anything but pleasant - it felt like a torturous 12-hour trip in a suburban train. The seating is incredibly narrow and uncomfortable. The new seat shape and tilt adjustment are OK, but seats are far too narrow, hard and uncomfortable and the aisles and corridors are too narrow. 10 seats per row with far too many rows is too tight even for Economy and absolutely terrible. Keeping a relatively normal posture during eating was virtually impossible, the flight attendants could hardly reasonably circulate through the corridors. I have not flown that unpleasantly for a long time and will next look for an alternative to this SWISS B777 aircraft with its terrible seating structure. Compared to the A340, SWISS has further devalued economy with the B777. I strongly advise my family and friends not to use this SWISS aircraft for a long-haul flight.",June 2017,"April 14, 2018",2.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,5.0
Space optimized but great service,Zurich,Bangkok,International,"SWISS 777 is very modern plane with lots of multimedia equipment on board. Flying Economy class in such planes is usually very cost optimized. As a 1.80m+ guy space is used and to fly long haul in a middle seat a terrible pain. However, service and food was quite good and you get the SWISS feeling on top. If you can afford choose business or other airline offering premium eco, otherwise you will be completely dependant on your seat neighbours how enjoyable the flight will be.

Avoid Swiss International Airlines,Paris,Siem Reap,International,"I would recommend that you do not take this airline !!!!

The only alternative they can offer is to leave 3 hours later from Paris and then stay over in Zurich and leave the next day at the same time. They cannot find another alternative !

The result is that my family and myself are loosing 1 day of our  very short vacation in Cambodia and are also paying for a  very nice hotel room in Siem Reap for nothing .

Great if you book direct,San Francisco,Zurich,International,"Swiss is one of the better airlines to fly from the West Coast to Europe. 
Planes are cleaner, newer, and the staff seems to have a moderate amount of concern for the flyers. 
First Class lounge in SFO is with United, it's clean and comfortable with a few choice food and drink (alcohol included) options. It feels a bit small but it works. 
The first class cabin is setup more for the solo traveler, and you get a sense of your own ""space"" on this plane more than most. It's open and comfortable, yet can be made more private. 
The staff was considerate and helpful at all turns. The food was a notch above many other international first class options (so far). 
My only complaint comes from the Zurich airport & Swiss Airs guidelines there.
Even if you are in the first class lounge here (which is spectacular) you will have to go through a SECOND security gate, where technically there's a separate line for first class customers, but honestly, everyone is in it and it doesn't go anywhere. It made for a rather stressful start to our flight out.
Also, as we learned, if you've purchased your ticket through any other service/airline (such as through United, as we did), even IF you have a fully labeled First Class ticket, you are not technically supposed to be allowed to use the Swiss First Class Lounge. You will be asked to head to the Business Class Lounge. 
We found this out AFTER we'd been shuttled over in a private car from the main terminal & security, brought up the elevators, and then rudely informed we weren't welcome after all. (Managed to get them to let us in, but it was a rather intense argument)
So book with Swiss, or perhaps don't fly through Zurich... apparently that's the only city they block you from the full First Class experience. (And it's easier to make changes when you've done this)",September 2017,"April 13, 2018",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,5.0

Would not fly them again,New York City,Canton of Geneva,International,"We took a direct flight on Swiss Airlines from JFK to Geneva, Switzerland to go on a trip with our ski club.  There were 52 of us in the group.  Most of us brought our ski gear but 10 of our group did not receive their skis and 1 did not receive her boot bag until 3 days later.  It was very frustrating for the people who didn't get their gear as they could not talk directly to someone to find out the status of where their bags were.  They could only go to a website which told them when their bags were delivered.  I met one woman who was staying at a nearby hotel but came to ours desperately looking for her suitcases.  Apparently it said on the website that her bags had been delivered but she couldn't talk to someone at the airline to find out where they had been taken.  Our travel agency was the same as hers so the travel agent recommended that she check with our hotel.  As it turned out, her bags were indeed delivered to our hotel.    The other issue was that my husband and one other man in the group almost didn't get seats on our outgoing flight even though the trip had been booked 6 months before!  The two of them were given standby tickets until they were given seats at the gate.  My husband was fairly hysterical not knowing whether or not he would be able to go on the trip.

I also asked for a cheese sandwich but was given a beef sandwich by mistake. When I asked if it could be replaced by a cheese sandwich, the stewardess told me ""only if there are any sandwiches left by the time I offer them to all the other passengers.""

Excellent Business Class Flight with Swiss in Europe,Porto,Zurich,Europe,"We flew with Swiss aboard one of their A320‚Äôs from Porto back to Z√ºrich in business class.
The airport in Porto offers fast track security check, so its a pretty painless journey through to the airport lounge.
The lounge itself in Porto is also good with a wide selection of beverages (including Port Wine!), as well as cold buffet and even a couple of warm dishes.
Swiss offers priority boarding for business passengers, so we got on the aircraft fairly rapidly.  Once onboard, crew were vigilant ensuring the economy passengers were not stowing baggage in the business class lockers so there was plenty of overhead stowage space.
The aircraft was clean and passenger areas well maintained.  Takeoff was delayed by 30 minutes and we were unable to make the time up on the journey; I don‚Äôt recall the reason for the delay.
The meal service on the plane was most excellent.  Because the segment from Porto is over 2 hours, they offer a full meal service consisting of Salad (W√ºrst K√§se Salat), Hot Main (the ubiquitous Chicken or Pasta), Dessert (Carrot Cake), Cheese.  I selected Champagne to accompany my meal and although the beverage served was indeed champagne, it wasn‚Äôt all that good.
Service was overall very good and staff on the flight were friendly (not always the case with Swiss) although the Ma√Ætre de Cabine seemed more intent on talking to the Pilot deadheading in seat 1D than serving Business Class passengers which caused an undue delay to coffee & cognac.
A few years back I would never have spent additional money for business class on segments less than 4 hours, but I have to say, the product, and in particular that of Swiss has really come a long way.  I won‚Äôt pay any price for the higher service level, but the offering (fasttrack, lounge access, priority boarding, additional carry-on entitlement, full meal service) is certainly worth something.
Overall I would rate the service quite excellent and I will enjoy future regional flights with Swiss in business class.",March 2018,"April 1, 2018",5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Poor punctuality and poor confort,Vienna,Zurich,Europe,"Arriving late is always a bad experience, but for a company which carries ""Swiss"" in its name (although owned by Lufthansa) this is even worse, as most of us associate Swiss with punctuality. 

Unfortunately, both my outbound (LX 1582) and inbound flights (LX 1579) were late, with one of them delayed by almost 45 min (over a travel time of 1h 10 min) - i.e., 65% of flight time. Like most companies nowadays, Swiss not only artificially inflates the scheduled travel times (so as to be formally ""on time""), but cannot respect even such ""inflated"" schedules ... a real shame which shows how much consideration they have for the time of their passengers. In fact, despite being late, the aircraft never exceeded 720 km/h, although able to reach 850 km/h. Obviously fuel consumption is a more important concern than your lost time ...

Worse yet, as with low-cost companies, you have to pay for checked luggage. So most passengers embark with hand luggage, which adds other delay during boarding. 

Besides this, the new Swiss aircrafts (such as e.g. A321) offer only cramped sitting room, where one can barely fit, even if the passenger in front of you does not recline the seat. 

The only positive aspect was the good service offered by the cabin crew. Yet, overall there were too many drawbacks and an inadequate price-performance.

The mid-flight snack was a hot cheese torte and a cold creme brulee ice cream, which were very good and much nicer than the small dry sandwich and ice cream cup you get on United.   There was another snack that was a small swiss chocolate bar - that was a nice surprise.    The TV screens worked very well, and there were many empty seats, which is nice for the passengers.   I was disappointed that they wanted to charge me just to have a reserved seat - seriously, only discount airlines should do that, it's tacky and cheap.  So I had refused to pay and was resigned to getting a bad seat when I arrived at the airport - but in fact there were many available seats so I got a center section aisle with two empty seats next to me.

Almost hits the spot,Bangkok,London,International,"Swiss almost makes it, but not quite. My big problem with the flight was how hot the cabin was. When I tried to lay down for a nap, it was too hot and uncomfortable for me.

European airlines will never, in my opinion, be able to compete with South East Asian airlines for customer service, although Swiss tried.

A Swiss Nightmare - with a little help from Austrian Airlines...,Vienna,Zurich,Europe,"The return flight on March 2nd to Zurich turned out to be the worst customer experience ever encountered. Original departure 8.10 pm was delayed without any communication until midnight. No drink, no snack, no information, absolutely nothing. A couple of strange excuses, machine arrived too late, but is soon ready, technical issue, new machine will be ready soon, etc etc etc. Both gentlemen Mr. Slamenik and Mr. Scharvier were helpless and actually looked like they knew more, but were not allowed to tell. After midnight passengers were told to gather outside in the cold snow and wait for a bus. After an hour in the snow, a first bus came. But we needed two. At 2 am we arrived at a far away suburb hotel. No drink, no food, just one concierge to check in 80 hotel guests. All guests were booked on a return flight for 6 am the next day, so back to the airport at 5 am. No breakfast no coffee no sandwich nothing.
When trying to make a complaint, Swiss turns to Austrian and Austrian keeps very very quite - have not even received an answer to my complaint until today.

So if you plan to fly a quality airline because of the customer service, consider twice....

Not bad but also not good,Zurich,Berlin,Europe,"I am glad I did not book and pay for business class. The service and snack might have been different but the seats were not. A joke.

However the toilets 2 for the entire economy class were so tiny especially as you had to go through the board kitchen. During service it was almost impossible to use the entry door to the toilet.
On the return flight it was worse. The flight was operated by Helvetic Airways and they used a very small Embraer jet where seats like baby seats. I am of average weight and height but could barely fit in. On Line check in was limited to the boarding pass could not print out the luggage tag. Bad service at Berlin Airport which is really a Banana republic airport not worthy of the Germans Capital airport. Toilets on the flight for midgets only.

Helps set the standard for European short haul,London,Zurich,Europe,"travelled in business class on Swiss Airlines from London Heathrow T2 to Z√ºrich. The flight had a scheduled departure time of 5pm. 

Check-in and the priority security line were very quick; I was airside within 10 minutes of arriving in the terminal. 

As I‚Äôd arrived about 3 hours before my flight I decided to try two lounges in Terminal 2B. I REALLY enjoyed the United lounge and the choice of various travel themed cocktails, notably the ‚ÄòGrand Diablo‚Äô which is the first cocktail I‚Äôve tried with a warning label: ‚ÄòWarning: incredibly hot‚Äô was clipped to the glass. I didn‚Äôt try the food. 

I also had a short but pleasant visit to the Singapore Airlines lounge, which was largely empty. I really enjoyed the Malaysian Curry with sticky rice, as well as a Singapore Sling made from scratch and a sample of Cherry brandy.....! I left early to navigate back to T2A, but found the Lufthansa Lounge pretty poor by comparison and left after 10 minutes. The emphasis definitely seems to be on functionality rather than any wow factor. Departure was from gate A16, and a clear priority line was in operation. I was onboard within a minute or so of arriving at the gate. 

The aircraft was an Airbus A320 and I was sitting in 1A, which I‚Äôd picked online a few weeks before. This is a good seat as it has two windows and extra legroom. There was a fair amount of drama with a passenger who had put his coat in the overhead locker and insisted that no other items were placed near it. The coat eventually ended up in the middle empty seat next to him. 

The flight pushed back at 5pm exactly. A short announcement followed in English and German: the flight time would be 1 hour and 15 minutes. Take off was at around 17:15. A light meal was served, although my strong recommendation would be to eat in the lounge if you‚Äôre looking for anything substantive or hot. Food was served on a tray which comprised (amongst other things) three slices of roast beef, some salad and a separate plate of Swiss cheese. Plenty of warm white and brown bread rolls were offered. The crew were proactive with drinks and champagne was served from a full size bottle. I was quickly brought a peppermint tea on request, which was served with Swiss a Airlines branded chocolate. Further chocolate was offered from a basket around 30 minutes before landing. Landing was at exactly 6:30pm UK time. Disembarkation was via a remote stand, but there was a dedicated business class bus with special seating to take us to the terminal; a nice touch. 

My suitcase was already on carousel 23 when I reached baggage reclaim. I was in a Oerlikon within 15 minutes of leaving Zurich airport. 

In summary, I‚Äôve previously found that Swiss sets the standard in short haul European business class and today‚Äôs experience only reinforced that opinion. I very much look forward to travelling with Swiss to London in two days.",March 2018,"March 24, 2018",4.0,,,,,,,,

Can't Reserve a Seat on Code-shared Air Canada Flight!,Montreal,Zurich,International,"Other travelers should be aware of this issue:

I booked a series of flights for a family vacation on Air Canada's website on flights operated by its alliance partner Swiss International Airlines. I tried to reserve seats because families like to sit together. Neither of Swiss nor Air Canada allow us to do this and each informed us we would have to wait for check in 24 hours before the flight. Swiss says it can't do it because it's agreement doesn't allow it to charge. Air Canada says it can't do it because it can't access Swiss' systems. I complained to both airlines on their customer service lines and in writing but to no avail. Swiss customer services in particular was very unhelpful and difficult to understand, the function has clearly been outsourced and the representatives are difficult to understand. 

I have made an additional complaint to the Canadian Transportation Agency on the basis of discrimination (our tickets are being treated differently than either Swiss economy or Air Canada economy).

T2 better to depart from than arrive due to distance from plane to bags in the latter is long.

Information on my ratings:

5* I give relatively few. Has to be a place I would either go to regularly and consistently provide a cut above the rest, or a place that I may have visited just once and offered a particularly memorable experience or be exceptional value.

4* is a place I enjoy and would tend to go back to if the opportunity was presented. Probably a good level to aim at for a catering/hospitality business, as too many 5* suggests you may be underselling/undermarketing.

3* places - are adequate and I would sometimes go back to but other choices are generally preferred; normally there is obvious room for improvement, usually in the offering and value. It's a brief stop off but worth 30mins or so to look around.

2* places - have issues that make the experience below par,

1* places - hope I don't end up in one of these!",March 2018,"March 22, 2018",4.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0

One of the best Companies in Europe by far.,Zurich,Athens,Europe,"I'm writing this comment because of some weird comments I saw above.

I always try to travel Swiss what ever happens. My last flight was the GVA - ATH flight where I upgraded myself to business class, but I usually fly economy. The flight in business was obviously amazing but the objective of my review is talking about SWR in general.

Not only the cabin crew are very friendly, but also the pilot and f/o are very nice and passionate about their job. The food is great compare to other airlines. Swiss is usually on time or with acceptable delays.
They consider any of your requests and (while respecting the Swiss tradition perfectly about rules and safety - which I am looking for when flying) they tend to be understandable when possible (for cabin luggage for exemple).

I could not be looking for a better airline when traveling from Switzerland. I'm young and travel often for pleasure and I always try to fly Swiss.

The only reasons that would prevent that is when they have no direct flights from GVA (for exemple GVA - TXL) so I would take EZY to SXF, when an other option is really cheaper (that unfortunately happens to often) or to go to my original town in Spain where my only option is Iberia.

To be travelling with many companies (now ""down under"" since the beginning of the year, discovering other companies that I never took before), I can def say we are really lucky in Europe, especially with Swiss (from Switzerland at least). Swiss is much better than BAW, IBE, KLM (or KLC), ....

I would consider Air France nowadays (2018) though, they did become a very good airline to travel with for long haul flights and Lufthansa (talking about European companies).

To conclude, Swiss is an awesome company when it comes to my needs when travelling. Good Safety very friendly crew. Food and beverage (wine!) are great. Could need improvement in the entertainment system but the ""new"" A330 and B777 are amazing. Obviously flying with their new C-Series is a pleasure.

Delay of over one hour due to technical problems,Malaga,Zurich,Europe,"The aircraft arrived with a delay of over one hour coming from Zurich. Apparently due to technical problems with one of the aircraft wings.... It happened with an Airbus 321. Legroom as usual very limited, same applies to seat comfort. Forget reading a newspaper when the seats to your right and left are occupied. That‚Äòs why it is recommended to take your tablet with you with all stuff downloaded before....

They feed you all the time,Athens,Newark,International,"I felt the aircraft was clean. The seats were small but the seatbelt was quite long. There isn‚Äôt enough room between rows, especially if the jerk in front of you wants to fully recline the entire 9 hour flight. The flight attendants need to be more aggressive about telling passengers to sit down so we could take off instead of leaving 40 minutes late. Also, they had no control over the cabin, people were constantly standing in the aisle and constantly walking from one seat to another to talk. They feed you a lot of food and drinks but I agree with another review that the food was salty.",March 2018,"March 15, 2018",3.0,,,,,,,,
"Punctual, excellent service",Tel Aviv,Miami,International,"I flew return from Tel Aviv to Miami, with a stop both directions in Zurich airport. I was quite concerned about the long flights, as I had spinal fusion surgery 18 months ago. 
The seats on the plane were comfortable, and everyone had a pillow and a blanket, which also helped. The only difficulty regarding comfort was that the aisles are very narrow, so when I wanted to stand for a while, I was obstructing the pathway.
The food was very good, there was plenty of it and it was tasty.
The entertainment system was also good, there were individual screens with a wide range of films and tv shows on offer. The entertainment system turned on before we took off, which was a nice perk.
The toilets were kept clean throughout the flights.
The stewards and stewardesses were very friendly and responsive.
Every one of the four flights left on time, and we actually landed before schedule - this was really helpful on the return, as I was a bit anxious about having only 90 minutes between flights, we landed early so I ended up having 2 hours between flights. We also got off the plane by the same terminal that my connecting flight was leaving from, so I didn't need to run frantically between terminals. 
Zurich airport is really pleasant, there are plenty of shops and eateries available. Plenty of chairs for everyone. For the smokers among us, it's nice that they have smoking rooms dotted throughout the terminals. 
I really can't fault the airline at all and I'd definitely fly with them again.",March 2018,"March 15, 2018",5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,,
Not the best flight,Montreal,Paris,International,"This flight had two legs.  The first leg from Montreal to Zurich was alright.  We were in business class and had a bed.  The service was good and the food was decent.  The first problem started in the Zurich airport where we were pointed to a so called Business Lounge which was one of the dirtiest airport lounges I have ever seen.  The carpet was soiled, there was dirt on the walls and furniture.  The next problem was our flight from Zurich to Paris.  Again we had business class tickets but the plane was small and very cramped.  My friend flying with me uses a cane and has a lot of trouble with stairs.  We had asked for assistance at CDG.  We had to disembark on the tarmac , and although there was someone with a wheelchair waiting, she could find no way to enter the airport without stairs.  My friend then had to climb two flights of stairs.  This was certainly no business class flight in my estimation.",February 2018,"March 15, 2018",2.0,,,,,,,,

Have lost my trust in them,Tel Aviv,Zurich,International,"Upon embarking on another voyage to the USA, I booked my flights on UNITED, with the first leg being operated by SWISS, from Tel-Aviv to Zurich. Since I know how tight their economy class is, and since I have injured my knee recently, I decided to spend the extra money it costs to reserve in advance an extra legroom seat in the front row of economy. SWISS gladly took my money, and I was set for seat 23A. 
During the next two months or so, whenever I checked my booking, it was always seat 23A. Until the moment I logged in to perform my online check in... 
Suddenly my seat is.. 33E! I managed to ‚Äúimprove‚Äù it to 28A, but my seat was taken. To cut a long story short, I had word with SWISS on Facebook, with their office in Israel, with their online check in support in Capetown.. I was talking with people all over the globe, but all could only suggest I try and resolve this at the airport.
The person in Capetown mentioned the seat was reserved for someone else for medical reasons. 
I found it extremely rude to pull one like that on me. They could contact me and try and resolve it politely, but instead they delay the information until it‚Äôs too late to do anything.
When I got to the airport, I was very annoyed. I travel light, no checked bags, so I tend to arrive around 2 hours in advance, zip through security, then to the gate. Now I needed to get there earlier, run around, find the person that might help, she was not very service oriented, putting it mildly, and only after I became assertive, suddenly my seat was free for me to have. Just like that...
This leads me to believe it was no medical reason, just someone getting preferred treatment on my account.

So, SWISS still serve ok food, their FAs are professional, their seats in economy are not for anything longer than 4-4.5 hours, even in the A330. But now I‚Äôve seen a very ugly side of SWISS, and will most likely try and avoid them, because they breached our agreement and lost my confidence.",March 2018,"March 15, 2018",2.0,,,,,,,,

Complete OCD,Zurich,London,Europe,"Swiss are undoubtedly the most tedious short-haul airline I have ever flown with. I have flown with them several times (I am trying to avoid them but needs must when you need to get to Switzerland sometimes, unfortunately), and what you must know is that they have an obsession, and I mean total, ridiculous obsession, with your carry on luggage. At the gate their staff are equipped with hand scales and they wander round looking for people to hassle about the size of their carry on luggage. I was able to fit my cabin bag (designed by Samsonite to meet airline standards) into the doohickey designed to measure whether it is an acceptable size, but the SwissAir employee told me that I had to put it into the hold because it did not go in frictionlessly (and it has happened 3 or 4 times). OCD does not even begin to describe it...they‚Äôre petty, bloody-minded and unfriendly in the way that only they can be. They keep telling everyone that it is for ‚Äúyour safety‚Äù but in truth I feel they just enjoy being fastidiously silly and bullying. Aside from that, their cabin crews are also an unfriendly lot, their flights are often delayed, and they stick you in the back of the plane no matter what you try to book (and my flights are usually the highest cost category).

Stuck because employees lack compassion or common sense,Zurich,Boston,International,"Terrible customer orientation.  I was on a flight connecting through Zurich to Boston.  My inbound flight was late.  However, I sprinted to the gate and made it while the plane was still there and while the door was still open for boarding.  When I arrived, the gate attendants refused to let me board.  At first, they told me that the door was closed.  However, this was shown to be false because someone else boarded the plane 10 min after I arrived at the gate.  Then they told me that they had automatically rebooked me and that I had no choice but to stay in Zurich overnight and take a flight the next day.  

My seat on the flight was still empty, I had not checked any luggage, and if they ""rebooked"" me once, rather than rebooking me back onto the flight, they spent 15 total min arguing with me about why I would not be allowed on the flight.

If you've traveled extensively internationally, you would have been as outraged as I was at the sheer lack of any ... common sense? Compassion? Ability to think on the spot?  The word that came to my mind as I spoke with the gate agent was ""close-minded"" (there were other choice words that came to mind).  There was no reason  for me to miss 1 extra night away from my family.

To top it off, I contacted customer service.  They took 2 weeks to ""respond"" and basically told me ""whatever, it's not our problem.""

Avoid SwissAir (I know that I have).  The absolute worst airline, the worst customer service.  I sincerely hope the airline goes bankrupt.

Bunch of Cretins,Amsterdam,Singapore,International,"Absolutely appalled at the experience I had with Swiss Air - in the air and afterwards.

Below is a complaint I sent to Swiss Air a month ago which they have not bothered to address. These losers don‚Äôt care about repeat customers. 

On Friday 23 February my partner and I flew Swiss air to Singapore via Zurich, from Amsterdam.

This was our first time on Swiss Air, and given the experience we had will likely be our last.

Firstly the flight to Zurich was significantly delayed however our connecting flight was held waiting for us. We ran from terminal A to terminal E - a significant journey which left us sitting wet and sweaty for the duration of the flight to Singapore - not a great feeling.

When we arrived at the gate, a staff member crudely remarked that it was lucky we ran because they were just about to leave without us. The massive issue I have with this remark is the fact the delay was in no way our fault, and there was no assistance by Swiss Air to assist us in the significant journey from one end of Zurich airport to the other. In fact, when I mentioned we were on a connecting flight to the air hostess on the first flight she said to us that it was out of her control - there was no effort whatsoever to call us off the plane first. We waited close to 10 minutes for 20 rows of people to get off the plane before we could.

The second issue we faced was we explicitly asked the gate staff of the second flight if the bags from our flight had been transferred and loaded on to the plane, we were told ""yes, of course"". This was a lie as when we arrived in Auckland a day later - our bags were still sitting at Zurich airport. Not to mention how this has greatly affected my partner and I in regards to work clothing, toiletries, make up, we now know we were lied to by a member of staff.

Thirdly, when we arrived on the plane - dripping with sweat and puffing, we asked the air hostess if we could please have a small drink of water. To which she replied that she could not give out any drinks until the plane had taken off - we had to wait an uncomfortable 30 minutes for a drink of water. A small consideration could have been made we believe, given the huge effort made on our part to get on this flight - a delay which was not of our doing.

This same air hostess ignored us twice while doing the drinks rounds, and we ended up calling another air hostess to provide us with additional glasses of water.

This was not a great impression for us of Swiss Air, and we still feel very uncomfortable with the situation we found ourselves in.",February 2018,"March 11, 2018",1.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,,,,

Economy Class tight seating,Zurich,San Francisco,International,"I recently returned from a trip to Europe on SwissAir. At 5' 10"", 170 lbs., I consider myself to be of average height and weight. Leg room was marginal at best; when the seat in front of me was reclined, I had little room to even wiggle. Seat width was far too narrow, as my shoulders were literally pressed between the window and the passenger in the middle seat (also average sized male). In order to get into the aisle, both aisle and middle passengers had to completely move from their seats to allow me access. I remember a time when I could just step past them...that was also when I could sit comfortably in my seat without feeling like a canned sardine. This is the new norm for airlines--they cram as many seats as possible and reduce the number of flights so they can book to capacity, regardless of the sacrifice to passenger comfort. It is the world in which we live, so there is not much one can do about it, other than paying for all the ""extras"" which used to be standard. I can only suggest that one researches seat and leg room as part of the criteria for determining an airline. Though price is usually the determining factor, it isn't a bad idea to pay a little bit more for comfort and service...again, which has declined on almost every major airline that I've flown, both domestically and internationally. After adding the additional ""options,"" most flights increase by an average of 25-30%. Bare-bones fares don't offer much, but I at least expect quality service, not halfa-ssed service along with an apathetic attitude by the flight attendants, who are well aware of the changes to airplanes, but don't have the time to provide sympathy toward the many passengers who experience the lack of comfort. Of course, this should not be their job; therefore, corporate executives need to re-assess their business model(s) and consider offering an alluring experience to outshine the competition. It appears that they are all in accord with the fact that people are going to put up with the concessions if they want to continue to travel; hence they really don't give a rat' sass about anything more than the bottom line.

Only Average First Class,Zurich,Beijing,International,"Arriving in Z√ºrich with short Connection to Beijing there was no special service although travelling in First Class. I had to go the regular transfer into Terminal E then realizing that boarding was delayed but not long enough to wait in the Lounge. When boarding started, the First Class was not ready yet, so the First passengers had to wait the longest and board the last. On board there is enough space but somehow the service was only second class. The lunch took very long, although I told them I would like to get it quicker to get more sleep. But finally I skipped the desert as it would have taken another hour or so and got to sleep. Compared to the other First class passengers however, my bed was then made to get me some sleep to arrive somewhat relaxed the next day. Quality of food for dinner was first class however, so was the breakfast.

Comfortable seats in Business,Hong Kong,Zurich,International,"The seats in business class almost rival those on the best airline I‚Äôve recently traveled on, Japan Air. And the service from the attendants was excellent: smiling, attentive and courteous. The selection of movies is merely ok. The food was above average in taste, with the Swiss cheese taking the honors. But something I ate did not agree with me and caused part of my journey to be troublesome.

I was dismayed to be awakened by a very polite flight attendant who informed me that I had to get prior permission to use my small CPAP machine on the flight. He offered to try to get permission for me, but I declined as I didn‚Äôt expect I‚Äôd be able to fall sleep again. The rule strikes me as stupid, but I guess this is to be expected on an airline that is run with such precision.

"Reliable, Punctual, Improving Service and Good Value.",Montreal,Zurich,International,"We travel with Swiss in Business on-average twice a year, for the last 35 years

Business Class is very good in comparison to other airlines, but not exceptional (like Singapore or Emirates).  However fares are cheaper, which makes it very good value.
Entertainment system is very good, but the Music selections have slipped recently.

My 15:45 flight to Zurich finally took off at 18:30 (boarding at 17:00) and it would have been better if Swiss had rebooked me on the next days earliest flight with  connection to Amsterdam .. as it was now, I missed my connection and had to stay overnight at an airport hotel in Zurich.  Leaving all this to the side, I observed that:
1. we spent an hour at the tarmac before take off and it did not occur to the crew to at least offer drinks.
2. there was no information on connecting flights prior to landing and the ground staff announced by the cabin crew to be at the gate was not there.
3. the fate of my checked in luggage was nebulous until I was told to look for it myself on some carts where stored luggage had been collected.

Nowhere near good enough,Zurich,Singapore,International,"This was my first Swiss Air flight and I was travelling in Business Class.  The end to end experience was nowhere good enough, the experience very much reminded me of why the flagship carriers in europe are struggling to keep pace with the market demand.  I left the flight feeling that it was the best Economy class service I could remember, the only problem was that I had flown Business class.  

The seat was uncomfortable, the bedding was thin and did not keep me warm, the pillow was flat and offered no support.  The food was disgraceful, the evening meal was served in an odd manner, starter was delivered with desert.  The salad dressing was frozen and the olive oil was congealed, the salad was going brown and the cheese was dry and stale.  The main course was underwhelming but was edible.  The breakfast reminded me of a short haul business class flight in europe - I left the flight feeling quite hungry to be honest.

The buttons to control the seat were positioned right under my elbow on the armrest and were flush, so on several occasions I accidently placed my arm on the buttons and the seat lunged to adjust.  It seems like a silly design error

The staff were friendly but certainly lacked polish and professionalism. 

I strongly implore someone in Swiss Air to do some market research on your competition - buy some flights with carriers like Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Qantas and even British Airways etc and take some flights.

The hard product is certainly not world class but OK in both Economy and Business. Swiss' long-haul fleet is relatively young, especially if compared with decrepit US carriers' fleets.

Not so this time. All went well, efficient and on time. The plane was full, the crew however very friendly, motivated and helpfull.

I can't recall having ice cream for dessert on an airline before.  The earphones left on the seat before you even get there, the chocolates after the meal, these are the little extras that customers appreciate.  The weather in Montreal was very stormy when we arrived but the landing was very smooth and once we landed an announcement was made about connecting flights that was very helpful.

Free ski equipment carriage and competitive fare,London,Canton of Geneva,Europe,"Swiss do have limited slots in and out of Gatwick as opposed to Heathrow and City airports but it is great to fly on a scheduled airline with agreeable travel times to suit the passengers and not the airline.
The flight was in one of their Bombardier planes, which I understand are fairly new, and it seemed clean and comfortable with reasonable leg room. Very basic refreshments were provided on the flight but a simple buttered roll is very unexciting and not very palatable. On the other hand, the flight is only 1 1/4 hours so this is not really an issue.
Swiss are one of the few carriers to carry ski equipment free of charge in addition to normal baggage allowances, although their allowance is 23kgs and not 20kgs. Free are skis, boots and helmets (although I would not recommend that the latter goes separately in the hold). When I looked at the package price (ski equipment included) compared with other airlines, whether national or budget, I found that Swiss was by far the most competitive for my preferred departure and arrival points.

Swiss pluses: efficient, cheap if booked well in advance; good bag drop off after on-line check-in 24 hours before.

Swiss rail (SBB) unbeatably efficient.

Swiss minuses: Normally flight slot late in queue at LHR - up to an hour delay this time - but mostly they manage to catch up the time in-flight. On this occasion having booked two specific seats (extra charge) the airline arbitrarily changed the seats without notice.

Totally disappointing,Zagreb,Cancun,International,"husband and I had a return ticket Zurich-Cancun. The plane has very little space, not very comfortably. we were looking for a place to have both places. food on the plane is terrible, no taste, I have never eaten until the end, just so much to get hurt. Alcohol must be paid in addition, and I have not seen it anywhere else if the flight lasts almost 10 hours. I would like to praise the always smiling steward Samuel [-], who is always at the service. and critics would definitely give the stewardess Severine [-]. I have never seen such insolence and disrespect for the passengers so far. the flight to Zurich was delayed for an hour, I went to the plane and saw a few packs of small water bottles. I asked her to have one because I had not felt very well before, but she said they did not have them and I can not get the water. Later on she was asked me in a very disagreeable way to lift the seat for meals, when I asked her to do this and the traveler in front of me, she turned her eyes and she hardly did it. a very unpleasant experience that I have not met in all my travels so far. a good thing I can mention is that we get a voucher for food due to flight delays.

Wonderful trip,Bangkok,Zurich,International,"I want to take you under the wings of Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS). This is not my first time flying with Swiss International Air Lines. My first experience with this airline began at the age of 4 since the days it was known as Swiss Air.  You could say that I‚Äôm no stranger to this good airline and its hub at Zurich airport. For more than 3 decades, I have flown with this airline to Switzerland for leisure, family visits and academic purpose. 

Swiss International Air Lines operates one of the youngest and most modern fleets of aircraft in the skies today. Since the planes are so new, they are really clean. Swiss International Air Lines has won all kinds of airline awards.
In September 2017 of this year, it was another calling for me to fly under the wings of Swiss International Air Lines once again. This time, my trip flying with Swiss International Air Lines started from Bangkok to Zurich, and return on the same route. The service on the ground was excellent. The SWISS team at Bangkok office Mr. Stefan, Ms. Napaporn, and Ms. Prangthip were nice and service-minded people. At the check-in counter at Bangkok International Airport, the staffs were very energetic and the process ran smoothly. 

After checking in at the airline counter, and having passed through the emigration process, I headed for the Royal Orchid, a nice lounge with a variety of good food and quiet atmosphere. I would say that it was a perfect place to relax, and grab some drinks. Then it was time to board the Swiss International Air Lines aircraft. This one was a Boeing 777-300ER, pretty new and clean. This aircraft had 3 classes configuration: First, Business, and Economy. 

On the way from Bangkok to Zurich, I tried the Economy class. While I watched a movie, my meal was served and was delicious. During the night, there was the mini-bar where passengers could go to take snacks and drinks. 
On the way back, I gave Business Class a try. 
At Zurich Airport Lounge for Business, passengers were offered a luxurious experience equaling to any five-star boutique hotels. I enjoyed a lot of the new facility in the new lounge! It became my new favorite airline lounge that had everything you could possibly think of: comfortable chairs, many food stations, free Wi-Fi. 
Prior to takeoff, the flight attendants passed out amenity kits that have earplugs, lip balm, cream moisturizer, no-slip socks and an eye mask. The planes had mood lighting which helped you sleep better. The toilets were clean and bright with large mirrors. The seats also had built-in massagers. There were power outlets for both plugs and USB and no adaptors were needed.
Swiss International Air Lines' in-flight entertainment system was superb. You could have personal seat-back television screens. Each seat had state-of-the-art entertainment systems with various entertainment options‚Äîmovies, television, video games and music. The seat was comfortable with its automatic massaging functions.
While having a nice welcome drink before taking off, I could choose from assorted menus accompanied by plenty of Wines choices to go along splendidly with the meals. Then dessert and snack came later. Meal and beverage on the flight was excellent as usual. Later, I walked to the galley and picked up some snacks and drink from mini-bar.

Overall, I find Swiss International Air Lines delivering great service onboard. Cabin manager and team provided wonderful service. It was a good opportunity for me to meet with the nice and friendly Cabin Manager, Ms. Vanessa Ehrhart (flight Bangkok to Zurich) and the Cabin Manager Mr. Martin Nussberger (flight Zurich to Bangkok) who both took care of me during the flights. They are both very friendly and good service minded. I can say that with personnel like them in the airline business, they can be the benchmark for all other airlines to see them as role model. 
Two things which I must not forget to mention are the delicious chocolate pieces served on board and the merchandise of SWISS bags at Zurich Airport which were adorable. It was a pity that I had no time on the way back to buy some. 
I've always believed their services to be superior to their rivals in the world and nothing on my trip has changed my opinion that Swiss International Air Lines have by far the best cabin crew and ground staff around. I've already booked future flights with this favorite airline.

So in conclusion, I recommend you the ultimate choice of Swiss International Air Lines when flying! :-)

Swiss Oficiancy!,Tel Aviv,London,International,"Our flight(s) from Tel Aviv to London Heathrow (Via Zurich) were great! Check in at Ben-Gurian Airport was easy, simple and non stressfull, followed by our 1 hour wait to board the flight. We had plenty of time on our hands to visit the washrooms, and prepare before our journey home. This took a lot of stress away from the journey, and very much appreciate that. 

Flight number 1 was on a reasonably large aircraft, (the A330) offering a TV screan , with a veriaty of movies to watch in a veriaty of languages , a main corse meal (lunch) with pudding, comfy sheets and plenty full of legroom! Swiss Air has givin me probably the most legroom on an Ecconomy seat ever! The flight was smooth, organised and was truely a pleasure to be onboard. When landing in Zurich, from the moment we touched down the runway, we were disembarking the plane into the airport terminal with in 5 minutes- this is an example of Swiss Oficiancy! The only ‚Äòdown side‚Äô to the flight was the food- which to be frank, did taste horrible- but the excellent service made up for it!

Flight number two was short-haul ,and was from Zurich to London Heathrow onboard a medium sized A321. This did not offer a TV screan, nor a meal, but the seats were comfy, and by that time, I used the comfy atmosphere as a chance to sleep. My younger sister was feeling very airsick, we informed the cabin crew, and they invited her to the back of the aircraft to eat chocolate! This somehow cured plane sickness..

Baggage claim is another example of Swiss Oficiancy! By the time we reached Heathrow Terminal 2 baggage claim, our bags had already been put through the convertible belt, and Heathrow staff collected them, and all of them were on the ground!

My bag was well within the size required.  It wasn't just her doing her job it was her whole attitude.  She was just so rude.

Overrated with terrible service,Hong Kong,Zurich,International,"One of the worst long haul flights I‚Äôve been on. I was flying solo with my toddler and am probably being more brutal in this review as I flew with Cathay Pacific, long haul, also a 10+ hr flight , the couple nights before, and in comparison, they were amazing!

Will never pay for Swiss again. The only thing good about them was the (extra ‚Ç¨70 ) for the business lounge.

Cons:
* did not prioritise my boarding although I was with a 2 year old toddler 
* did not assist with my hand luggage when embarking on the plane (Cathay rushed to my assistance and helped me with all they could!)
* they did not serve me my vegetarian meals and were inconsistent with the children‚Äôs meals
* rude flight attendants 
* need customer service training 
* old, outdated fleet 
* plus the food was unhealthy, bland and processed. I mean, I don‚Äôt expect much from flight food but this was pretty bad.
*awful entertainment selection. Glad I loaded up my own iPad for my child 
* no kids pack given out during the flight 

Pros:
* the lounge
* on time and got to our destination early
* baggage was quick to receive back 

Of all the things, the way I was treated with a small child on a long international flight was appalling. They didn‚Äôt make it a smooth and enjoyable flight and for that very reason, I will stick to Asian airlines on long haul flights! ANA, Singapore airlines, Cathay Pacific etc. all know how to treat their customers. I‚Äôd rather pay more for quality.

Best Airline to travel to Europe/ Good meal/ Top Lounge services,Montreal,Zurich,International,"Swiss air is our favorite airline company to use when comes time to travel to Europe, the meal quality and services during flight are excellent, and if you have any problem they will usually fix it quick because they care about customer and wants to keep them.

Swiss Air Lounge is upon my favourite lounge to use; service, variety, amenities, are exceptional and I think this is the Swiss Way of doing business and always keeping a high standard on everything which is very appreciated by travellers. Swiss Air Staff are reliable, efficiency and you can see they love what they do.

Swiss Arrival Lounge Zurich:
We were travelling on business class, this was the 2nd time using the arrival lounge in Zurich and the high standard and quality remain the same, very practical, if you like to sleep a little more before arrival and have breakfast at the lounge or waiting for your connecting flight.  The lounge has great variety to choose from for breakfast including cheese, cold meat, croissants, pastry, scrambled eggs, sausages, yogurt, ice cream, several choices of juice, coffee, hot chocolate, etc. The arrival lounge also offers showers, cabin if you want to get some rest before your next flight, free Wi-Fi and some isolate cabin (working areas) if you need to get some work done. They also have several computers which you can use at ease. The staff is everything you would expect from Swiss people, they are nice, happy to see you, and very helpful. I wish Swiss Air will congratulate the following employee for the outstanding service while using the arrival lounge in Zurich; Catania Gabi and Aeschlimann Anna.

Swiss Departure Lounge Zurich:
For the first time, we decided to use the Swiss departure lounge in Zurich, nothing more than WOW and perfection on every aspect, something you would expect from Swiss Air, Pasta bars made right in front of you, rice, meat, small sandwiches, soup, salad, nuts, fruit, cakes, ice cream and a large choice of beverage; alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages.

Premium Airline - Low Cost Service,London,Zurich,Europe,"I travel a lot and am Star Alliance Gold Card Holder. I fly Swiss regularly and have to comment that they gradually deteriorate. Staff do not really recognise Star Gold status to start with: no priority seating on board their aircraft, no lounge access at City Airport etc... Check in is standard, cabin crew are acting like robots, seats are hard and not ergonomic and my seat was full of breadcrumbs from the previous passenger.

Moreover my luggage was lost on this SWISS direct short-haul flight LX 451 from LCY to ZRH. When reporting the loss at your SWISSPORT office in Zurich Airport the staff asked me to step back and not approach the lost luggage counter (claims have to be done at a self-service-machine now). Being a Star Alliance Gold Member I vainly looked for a specific line for Miles and More or Star GOLD card holders. The reception of staff was rude, ineffective and perky. I was not the only passenger being very upset towards your staff and their tone was DISTRESSING myself and other passengers. The situation was about to escalate when a fellow passenger was close to lose his nerves when a member of staff informed him that ‚Äúthe airline Swissair has closed down years ago ‚Ä¶.. ‚Äú - he had referred to Swissair instead of SWISS INTERNATIONAL AIRLINE.
I have to admit that I have rarely seen such a disastrous and indifferent staff behaviour with ANY airline in the past years. I felt shame for the airline when I saw how little bad behaviour can kill the image of a renowned international air carrier for an entire group of customers waiting to be helped in a desperate situation like this, regardless of their frequent flyer status which  was NOT respected anyway. 
I only got my luggage back more that 24 hours later which was annoying - however I will never be able to forget the scenario at the SWISSPORT counter at Zurich Baggage Hall a few day before Christmas.

Upon complaining with SWISS customer service I received an answer almost 6 weeks later with a shot apology. No reimbursement for costs that incurred, no good-will gesture, nothing.

The Bad and the Great Service,Zurich,Johannesburg,International,"Our flight from Madrid to Zurich was excellent on Swiss Airlines.  We were in a new airline & their seating space was very good.  The service was very good also.

The flight from Zurich to Johannesburg South Africa was very different.  We will start out with the bad - We had selected exit row seats for this very long flight.  When we were boarding the plane, the local crew advised us (with no advance notice of any kind) that they had moved us to another row.  They did not provide us with any explanation as to why we were moved (we did find out later that it was to accommodate a young family with an infant).  We were put in a row near the back that had the worst legroom due to the entertainment box under the seat in front of our row. It would have been better customer service had they at least had the courtesy of advising us of the need to move us.  Also, they could have actually moved two other singles to accommodate that family had they actually checked first.  The good service on the flight was the actual flight crew.  I had a medical emergency within 15 minutes of our departure from Zurich that resulted in a possible an on-board doctor advising that I be left in the back of the plane (in a crew member's jump seat with my legs propped up for the entire flight).

This caused my connecting flight in Zurich to be delayed and my second flight to NY to be rerouted to Chicago, where I was stuck there for a night. Swiss Airlines customer service, the whole way through, even from pilot to desk associates, was absolutely OUTSTANDING. I was so impressed. Despite the inconvenience of the storm (which is completely outside of the airlines control), the tiredness of travel, and ending up in a different final destination, I felt so taken care of and in such great hands the whole time. During our short 3 hour delay, they gave our whole flight a lunch voucher, and when we were stuck in Chicago, they put everyone up in a very nice hotel and also provided a voucher for breakfast and dinner there!

Continuosly getting worse without dropping prices,Montreal,Zurich,International,"Flying CH-Canada multiple times per year for over 7 years, as well as plenty of other European flights, the airline offers less and less for the same price.
While pilots and their information are always topnotch, I agree that Customer Care at Swiss is non-existent. This time upon arrival in Zurich at around 6am (on-time), exhausted passengers waited around one hour for their luggage (usually in Zurich luggage arrives after a few minutes already), with no information at all. After about 5 minutes of saying 'luggage delayed', the flight disappeared completely from the luggage indication screens. Slowly but surely people asked each other what's going on, and I asked two airport employees about the state of our luggage  - they rudely told us they wouldn't work for Swiss International Airlines and thus not care about the situation. After my partner went off to find somebody at the Missing baggage counter, he came back with the response that this is due a Computer System Issue, and after I recommended that a PA announcement might be a good idea, they announced a problem with their system by speakers.
Also, apart from several broken / randomly reclining seats on this flight (has been like for years), they now force-feed Breitling-advertisement on you by IFE system (which during ads you cannot turn off), and even worse illuminate the dark night cabin with three screens constantly sliding ads by. To top it off, the IFE now has a (quite insensitive) touch screen next to the (good hand controller), thus your seat wiggles each time the passenger behind you tries to control its IFE. And yes, trying to contact Customer Care usually takes ages. But - flight fare has not changed over years.

Delayed luggage for 2 days spoilt holiday,London,Dar es Salaam,International,"Flight from London delayed by 40 mins. Then at Zurich it was a mad rush to get to the gate to catch connecting flight now only 20 mins or so away. No Swiss air ground staff to help navigate from one terminal to another which included a train ride. To make matter worse a security check in between manned by one staff. Chaos and passenger arguing with everyone late for their connection. Eventually out of breath we get to our gate to find out its delayed. In fact a delay of nearly two hours as apparently there were not enough de-icers to clear snow from the plane. So overall our flight was late nearly three hours. And matters got worse as our luggage did not arrive and we were told to come back to the airport two days later for the next flight.
No luggage and no clothing. We asked for some compensation and were told we could spend $100 per person and had to claimwith receipts. For two days clothing and toiletries this was not adequate and it cost to travel to and from the airport. In addition we were booked to fly Zanzibar on Wednesday morning which we had to cancel as we had no clothing. We had to pay to rebook the flight and lost one days paid hotel accommodation.
We have submitted a claim but so far have received holding reply saying Swiss air are very busy with queries and they will get back.

Not as good as people say,Manchester,Singapore,International,"We chose Swiss Air as it is supposed to be a very good airline to fly with - but on this particular journey from Manchester to Sydney we had the chance to do a direct comparison with Singapore Airlines Business Class .
We initially flew to Zurich - a short flight and so did not expect a lot . Our connection was a 5 hour wait and so we used the lounge, which was lovely and had a quiet zone with beds so you could rest . 
Our connecting flight then took us to Singapore where we changed to a code share with Singapore Airlines onwards to Sydney . 
The seats and space on Swiss Air in Business Class is not huge ( larger than economy but lacking in a feel of luxury) . We were initially separated on the flight but managed to rearrange seats together . The seats are material and the foot well allowing you to stretch out when reclining into a flat bed is very minimal. As a result it is not easy to turn.
Food arrived on a plastic tray in bowls ( not always plates) .  On the way out we didn't sleep much but these issues became significantly pronounced upon our return - asking for a cup,of tea necessitated having to mime what a cup of tea with milk was after asking for several times . Speaking English by the stewardesses was not a priority , which was surprising on an international flight and the staff frequently spoke over us inGerman as if we were not there. 
By contrast Singapore Airlines was superb - broad leather seats and plenty of space around each seat . The service was superb. Food was delivered in a personalised way and individual tables set beautifully and nothing was too much trouble . Bathrooms were clean and well stocked . The staff made your 'bed' up and this included a mattress and duvet once the seat was completely flat. I would on balance definitely go for Singapore Airlines for comfort and good service - especially when you are paying Business Class Rates .",January 2018,"January 28, 2018",2.0,,,,,,,,

Terrible Customer Services Department,Manchester,Zurich,Europe,"Do not fly Swiss if you want all your baggage to arrive.

It took them 2 days to deliver the missing baggage, despite them telling us it would be delivered the following day.

The only way to contact them to make a complaint and a claim is via an online form, which does not work, so basically, you can't contact them.

Denied boarding and forced me to buy connecting flight with Emirates,New York City,Dubai,International,"Thanks for the birthday gift from Swiss Air. I was denied boarding at JFK airport and forced to buy connecting flight with Emirates (from Dubai to New Delhi).
I was told that I have to have Dubai visa in advance even I told them that I will be taking baggage transfer only (at Dubai airport) and not enter Dubai (I showed my connecting flight tickets with Indigo from Dubai to New Delhi). 
But staff refused to even acknowledge the Indigo Airlines and laughed at it saying ""what is Indigo"". After this, staff said I have to get visa for Dubai and I can't take baggage transfer at all, so I also showed the staff documents stating that if I have a valid US visa and I am an Indian citizen then I can get visa on arrival (as they were forcing me to exit the airport at Dubai).
I also shared information about my friend's tickets (Names are Dhruv Verma and Shatadiya Saha) and documents who traveled with the same Swiss flight day before I and Swiss let them go and Dhruv Verma took on arrival visa and Shatadiya Saha took baggage transfer.
After an hour-long discussion, Swiss staff at JFK forced me to but Emirates ticket from Dubai to Delhi and only then let me board the flight.
The behavior of the staff at JFK was really rude, even the staff manager (a lady) was so rude that instead of listening to my problem and help me she told me on my face that I can't travel at all.
This whole incident cost me (a student) 1000$. 
After reaching Dubai, I took normal baggage transfer and traveled with Indigo to New Delhi. (I didn't have to take any visa but due to Swiss air staff's arrogance at JFK I faced serious discomfort which also costs me 1000$).
This was really a bad experience with people from Swiss Air, I will recommend all of my friends to not travel with Swiss now on and I will do that too. I will also post my reviews everywhere online so nobody else has to face the rudeness of Swiss staff.
-----------
After more than a month I got an email saying all the lies of SWISS ground staff at JFK that I forced them to check in my baggage till delhi and that is why they forced me to buy a ticket with Emirates as they don't have any pact with Indigo Airlines.
First of all I never asked for my baggage to be checked in till Delhi (I am uploading a ticket where I checked in my own baggage before going to airport for weighing them at counter and it shows that I checked in my baggage till dubai only) instead they said that I only have that choice, secondly if they don't have any pact with any airlines that how come its a problem of customer ? they should have handled that.

"used to be premium, now average",Zurich,Miami,International,"As a Swiss, we once were really proud of ""our"" airline. For good reason because it used to be a premium airline that set standards. Feels like this is a long time ago. Don't get me wrong: Swiss isn't a bad airline, it's just average and nothing special. Main reason for me still using Swiss is that they have direct flights from Switzerland to many destinations. 
My recent experience with Swiss, a flight from ZRH to MIA, was rather disappointing. No leg room, old and worn entertainment system. This time, I only had problems getting stereo sound. On other flights, the whole system didn't work. Not having too much choice on new movies, well, this is Swiss on A340. A seat in my row was simply defective - before we even started. Since it was obvious and not a hidden problem: why didn't somebody fix it or at least not book a passenger on this seat? The flight attendants were ok but no better than this. 
All in all, Swiss would better have a look at some other airlines like Singapore, Air New Zealand, Emirates... Latest technology, quiet, spacious, friendly service. Oh, and since Swiss/Lufthansa obviously don't see a need for it: Premium Economy IS a requirement  these day and it IS very well booked.

The seating arrangement in Business Class is one of the better ones, the seats are however not the widest in class. And on other airlines you get a sort of bedcover for the night rather than just a blanket.

Quality Starts with Timely Response to a Customer,New York City,Nairobi,International,"At the airport when I got to the check-in counter, I was told that the flight had left-this was 40 min prior.  On questioning this it was claimed that the passengers had boarded-typically it is 20 min before.  Then I was referred to the re-booking queue.  At that point I was a no show.  I was not going to be able to make it through security, etc. 

There were five other people referred to this line after me that were supposed to be the on the same flight to Zurich-I spoke with them.  It follows if I was a no show anyone that got to the check-in counter after me for the same flight had the same status-no show.  As I stood there waiting for a manager that I was told over an hour later would not be coming, the other people were reissued tickets, no re-booking fees or penalties.  I needed to pay re-booking fees and penalties equivalent to the price of the ticket.  The next day these fees were over $800.  An observation, they had checked in online and were not minorities.

The response from Zurich customer service, be patient quality is important to them.  That was seven days ago.....  Quality starts with timely response to a customer delayed for 10 days that had to get another ticket, staff were quite rude.  I was at the airport for 5 hours and I thought a resolution was reached.  In that time other unpleasant observations were made.",January 2018,"January 17, 2018",1.0,,,,1.0,,,1.0,

"Good service, leg room limited though",Marrakech,Canton of Geneva,International,"Swiss uses the new bombardier CS 300 airliner. The positives are: good service, very polite and friendly staff, clean cabin. Good champagne and wines. Nice chocolate service !
For the rest: leg room is very tight in business class. The D seat in front sticks out and at the boarding and service times, it is pretty uncomfortable to sit there. The tight galley for the crew is also visible as they seem to struggle with the tight space around them. The bathroom was clean but the wash basin is very badly designed - when you wash the water inevitably spills out onto the floor. 
Boarding was poor - aircraft was late and we were left standing out in a queue for sometime before boarding started. No effort was made to board families or children first. There was a back door available for boarding and I do not know if that was used as it seemed every passenger came through the front door - hence the uncomfortableness in the front business class seats. Best to board the business class later when everyone has settled in. 
Food - no choice of meals. It was good but there was only a meat-potatoes meal available. 
As usual in Geneva airport, you wait hours for your baggage.",January 2018,"January 17, 2018",4.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,1.0,5.0
Lost my Luggage,London,Canton of Geneva,Europe,"Whilst getting there I had no trouble with my luggage. But whilst coming back I had done some shopping for Christmas and had a few expensive items in the bag. So coming back from Swizterland they lost that bag of mine. I waited and waited for it to turn up, checked each and every single abandoned bags in re-claim baggages and went to report it missing. I was told after filling out the necessary forms that someone should get into contact with me within 5 days or earlier if they find my bag! Of course they did not.. So the next thing I had to do was fill in yet another form regarding the missing items. Within days of filling the form in I got a text message saying they have found my bag and will be deliverying it soon.. They had to rather then fork out. It only costs them around ¬£100 to have my bag delivered then pay up. Really made me laugh. But I still gave them Average as I had no trouble flying in and out it was a plesant flight just that they lost my bag and it was during christmas time and all the gifts were in there. So that was the painful part!",December 2017,"January 17, 2018",3.0,3.0,4.0,,4.0,5.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
One bad experience offsets previous average experiences,Vienna,Brussels,Europe,"The weather might be really bad, or the Swiss Airport might be really unprepared for the cancelled flight chaos caused by bad weather But the airline could have helped probably by arranging its customers to the next available flights with a staff or a temporary signboard directing customers to go to certain gates, instead of asking customers to line in an disorganized queue that's mixed with long-haul and short distanced flight customers. With more than 500 customers, but with only 5 counters handling flight change arrangements, and each counter spent 1 hour on one long haul flight customer. I find this to be annoyingly unacceptable. I spent 8 hours standing in the queue, got my turn to the counter and arranged the last flight of the day to Brussels 30 minutes before the flight. It sounded almost fortunate in the unfortunate day caused by weather and human. However my luggage was not on the same plane. Only got my luggage received at where I stayed 20 hours later.",January 2018,"January 17, 2018",2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,4.0

Long Haul to India,London,New Delhi,International,Well maintained planes with good seats and excellent food service. This is not Emirates but its certainly close with plenty of space and good staff.

"actually: ""Swiss Global Airlines"": do not recommend their Boeing 777-300",Zurich,San Francisco,International,"The Boeing 777 - 300  Swiss Air has very narrow seats, little legroom and narrow aisles.
Everything is calculated to transport as much passengers as possible.
The configuration  in seats: 3 - 4 - 3 is over the top, especially for long distances.
In our case more than 12 hours non stop.
Sitting at an aisle watch your elbows and feet!.
Of course Swiss wants to make a profit, but this is over the limit for adult passengers.
Woud not step in this plane again.
We booked with United Airlines, but the flight was operated by Swiss:  result not at all possible to reserve seats, not even by payment en not  even by upgrade!. Only  customers who book directly bij Swiss have that privilege!",December 2017,"January 15, 2018",3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0
