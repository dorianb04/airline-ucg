Worst airlines experience of my life! IBERIA earned it!,Lisbon,Cairo,International,"Facts: 1. Poor check-in counter staff availability. As a result long queues on the check-in counter. Staff arrived 90 mins before flight departure. Before that there was no sign of IBERIA on the check-in counters at Lisbon Airport. Had to ask other airline staff for the IBERIA check-in counter.
2. Gate information was disclosed only 30 mins before flight departure. We had over 90 mins at Madrid airport to catch our connecting flight. No airline staff informed us about the updated gate or the terminal one needs to go to get the connecting flight. Unprofessional ground staff.
3. Baby stroller which was carried via cabin baggage was missed by airline staff along with over 10 cabin baggages at Madrid airport during the connecting flight transfer. Passengers were queueing up at Cairo airport to file their missing baggage report.
4. NSAS (delegated representative of Iberia at Cairo airport) gave us a PIR form with all info without the PIR reference number.
5. IBERIA staff who cannot be approached by any way other than a phone call asked repeatedly for the PIR number. IBERIA website is useless without a PIR number.
6. We called IBERIA phone number for baggage delay over 7 times and each time the customer support will ask to choose a IVRS option which did not exist. Unprofessional phone support.
7. IBERIA Instagram profile responded back saying they do not recognise NSAS as their representative. There is no counter of IBERIA at Cairo international Airport and NSAS features Iberia logo along with many other airlines for baggage and logistics support. IBERIA itself does not know about NSAS and cannot get in touch with NSAS (the entity they hired for Cairo operations).
8. The website for filing the delayed baggage claim does not work and gets stuck on a loop of ""please wait"".

Good to worst,Madrid,New York City,International,Flight was good and bad. The plane was dirty and our seat trays didn’t work. Seats were old not enough cushion on them.  The flight attendants were nice and very attentive. The food were good as well.  What made this four stars go into 1 is that they made me wait all that time looking dumb waiting for my bag when they knew it was still in Madrid. They told me it was going to arrive the next day and will be delivered same day. It didn’t arrive till the second day… my luggage looked like it was handled by the hulk. My brand new luggage came back with two missing wheels and beat up. I can’t seem to file a claim online it kept giving me errors and took forever to speak to someone on customer service line. When we finally got someone they barely spoke English and after all that explaining the call drops.  By the way when they called for us to get my bag we had to go to the car and we had to ask the man to open the trunk for us. He didn’t even get out of the vehicle. Very unprofessional.

Why not 5 stars? The aircraft they used both ways (EC-IJN) is over 20 years old, the seats and the legroom are the same as in economy, and there is no IFE on the older A321's.

All cabin crews were very good, and the purser on the BCN HEL sector on 08 December was outstanding (I guess his name was Ricardo): what a welcoming & professional person who did his job with joy, great motivation and enthusiasm, and comforted a younger passenger afraid of flying throughout the 4-hour flight.

My First Time,Madrid,Panama City,International,"First time flying with this airline.  After four legs, was not impressed.  The food was just bad on each leg.  On one leg, it actually made me sick.  We were served the same awful food back to back.  No clear soft drinks were available, ran out of cokes, didn’t have white wine.  Consider another in-flight food provider.

On one leg, I pressed the call button.  No one ever came.  I flagged down an attendant.  Which one is the call button?  Pointing to an area on the panel, the attendant said it was somewhere in that area.  Even then, the attendant didn’t turn the light off.  My video needed resetting.  I’ll tell someone.  Thirty minutes later, still no reset.  One hour later and three request later, the lead attendant did reset and followed up to confirm that the reset occurred.  

The flight crew was insensitive to the needs of passengers.  While they were serving passengers, and blocking the aisles, they refused to allow passengers to use the lavatories in business class.  These were long legs and the lavatories need to be cleaned during flights.

One leg, from Madrid to Barcelona, was delayed and cancelled because of weather in BCN.  No staff to direct passengers who arrived at the gate.  Limited staff at the customer service desk, creating extremely long lines.  There were employees sitting at the gates, but weren’t helpful.

Surprise they write back  saying  you have to complete the online claim!

I said i wanted to complain and was told I could. How do I do it ""you have to complete the on line forms""  which of course  were on the same system that was not working.

Our (me and my team) flight Madrid-Paris was cancelled, we had to go to Brussels instead the day after and take a train from Brussels to Paris. Our 3 suitcases didn't arrive. Very hard to reach customer service, they give you a number that doesnt do luggage service and tell you to call back the same number and choose another option , just that it doesnt give you any options, etc. My assistant called to different airports services and spent hours on the phone. 2 bags where tracked in bagtracer, 1 stayed unfound. LUCKILY there where airtags in the bags. After about 5 days 2 of the bags came back, delievered by a guy who was stinking of alcohol. One bag broken. The 3d suitcase was still listed on bagtracer as ""unlocalized"" , even though we tried to call and reach out to them as I all the time could see excactly where it was, on Madrids airport, but there was no one to accept an e-mail with screenshoots of the excact location. Eventually it got on a flight to Brussels and someone at Brussels airport told me and my assistant it was going to Paris. I got a notification and saw excactly where it was on the airport, but still noone at Iberia could be reached, and they where just telling us to wait.

Poor Service and Unresolved Award Flight Cancellation,Bangkok,Colombo,Asia,"I had an incredibly frustrating experience with Iberia that I feel compelled to share. I booked an award flight through their program on Sri Lankan Airlines and received a reservation confirmation. However, I never received a ticket number, and without any notification, my booking was canceled.

After days of back-and-forth communication with both Iberia and Sri Lankan Airlines, I learned that the cancellation occurred due to a payment issue between the two airlines—something completely beyond my control. Despite this being their error, Iberia offered no meaningful resolution other than refunding my Avios points, which does not compensate for the inconvenience or the fact that there are no comparable award flights available now.

To make matters worse, their customer service was unhelpful and evasive. I received no proactive communication about the cancellation, and I was left to discover the issue myself while trying to confirm my flight. Even after reaching out to them multiple times, I was met with dismissive responses and no accountability.

I expected better service and responsibility from Iberia. This experience has made me lose trust in their program, and I would caution others against relying on them for award travel.

Traumatising experience at the airport in Madrid,Madrid,Zurich,Europe,The women at the gate were rude and screamed at us. This is not what good customer service looks like.

Disastrous Experience with Iberia: Missed Connections on the Same Airline,New York City,Madrid,International,"strongly advise against using this airline, even as a Gold OneWorld member. We booked a flight from Paris to New York with a layover in Madrid, and the experience was disastrous both on the outbound and return journeys.

On the outbound trip, our flight to New York was canceled less than 24 hours before departure. We were offered an alternative via British Airways, which already made our journey more complicated. On the return trip, a delay on the Paris-Madrid flight caused us to miss our Madrid-Paris connection, even though both flights were operated by the same airline. No effort was made on board to prioritize us so we could catch our connection. We were rebooked on another flight, forcing us to wait an additional three hours at the airport.

To make matters worse, the Iberia staff at the airport was extremely rude. I am shocked that such an airline is part of the OneWorld alliance. I will never book a flight with this airline again.",November 2024,"November 24, 2024",1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0
Extremely Disappointing Experience with Iberia Airlines,Bogota,Madrid,International,"We booked a 10-hour flight in Premium Economy and paid an additional €60 (€30 per seat) to select specific seats in advance. Upon boarding, we were shocked to discover that we had been assigned completely different seats, not the ones we paid for. To make matters worse, the crew was not only unhelpful but also leaned toward being outright rude when we brought up the issue.

The new seats were incredibly inconvenient—located directly facing the crew area. This meant we couldn’t extend our legs due to the lack of a seat in front, and we were stuck staring at the inflexible kitchen wall throughout the flight. Additionally, the entertainment system was severely lacking, with only a fold-out screen that couldn't compare to the in-seat ones we expected.

The onboard service further compounded the disappointment. The crew was inattentive at best, and basic requests felt like an imposition. For an airline like Iberia, we expected much better service and accountability.

Iberia offered €600 in compensation (which was near to what I was claiming) but then rescinded the offer, saying they made a mistake (the cancellation was beyond their control) and made a new offer of €200. I still have not been given a reason for the cancellation so can they really do this?

THE PROBLEM was that our luggage had been interfered with and a load of clothes taken from one of the end compartments. So in essence- My belongings were stolen whilst in Iberia's possession. They are rejecting my claim- saying there is no record of an incident... Or that because there was no damage to the luggage  my claim is invalid.

Terrible Experience with Iberia – Avoid at All Costs!,Boston,Porto,International,"I booked my tickets with Iberia back in April for a trip in September, flying to Porto with my wife and our dog. I even paid extra to choose our seats—a window and aisle—for comfort. Without any explanation, Iberia changed our seats to the middle of the plane. Despite explaining the situation, we were told there was nothing they could do. To make matters worse, they forced us to check our carry-on bags, which contained all our clothes.

Our flight included a layover in Madrid. Due to fog, the flight from Porto had to turn back to Madrid, which I understand wasn’t their fault. However, when we landed at 10 AM, everyone had to rebook. The next available flights to Porto were at 3:40 PM and 7 PM. Given the long wait and our dog’s exhaustion on her first flight, we agreed to take a flight to Vigo at 3pm, an hour away from Porto, after Iberia assured us our checked bags would be transferred.

Surprise, surprise—our three checked bags didn’t arrive in Vigo. The agent informed us that the bags were sent to Porto at 4:40 PM, but when we drove to Porto Airport, they weren’t there. We opened a claim around 7 PM on Saturday, and it wasn’t until Monday that Iberia confirmed our bags were actually in Madrid. Even then, they couldn’t promise a delivery date, saying it could be Monday or the next day.

Their service got even worse. They delivered *one bag per day*—starting Tuesday and finishing Thursday. This mishandling ruined our plans. We had prepaid for a hotel outside Porto from Wednesday to Thursday, but we had to cancel since we were still waiting for the last bag. The hotel couldn’t refund my $160; instead, they offered a credit for future use. But we don’t plan on returning to Porto, and Iberia refused to compensate us for the loss.

On top of that, since we had to buy extra clothes during our trip, our bags were overweight on the return, and Iberia wouldn’t refund the overweight fees either. This was supposed to be a vacation, not a disaster. Iberia’s lack of care and logistical incompetence ruined our trip. Their refusal to take responsibility or reimburse us for the consequences of their failures is unacceptable.

I’ll never fly Iberia again, and I wouldn’t recommend them to anyone. This company clearly doesn’t prioritize its customers. Absolutely disgraceful service.",September 2024,"November 19, 2024",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0
Terrible experience and would avoid next time if I could.,Rome,Miami,International,"The worst airline experience. 
1. Couldn't complete online check in and get boarding pass ahead of time. There was some issue with needing a new ticket number. 
2. The boarding process is an unorganized sh!t show. It seemed like everyone with an economy seat was in the same boarding group and everyone lines up in a long disorganized line to wait to board the plane. 
3. The plane ran out of overhead bin space halfway through boarding passengers and had to check a bag at the gate last minute. 
4. The luggage that we had to check at the gate ended up getting left behind at our connecting flight in Madrid. So far It's been 4 days and we still don't have an update on it. 
5. The seats recline so far back, so if someone reclines their seat on you, it's very annoying and uncomfortable. 
6. Not the airlines fault, but my husband and I were sandwiched between two people in front who reclined their seats on us and a couple behind us with a child who sat on their laps and cried and kicked our seats for the entire 10 hours of the flight. This child also seemed way too big to sit on the parents laps and should have been required to purchase a seat for this kid.

Then In Madrid for our connection they sold the seats I had confirmed to another passenger. We were told to just keep walking to the back of the plane. The agent was very rude and dismissive towards the whole thing. Then they left my wifes bag in Madrid so upon landing in Barcelona, she had no luggage. We were scheduled to board a Cruise from Barcelona in another 36 hours so the airline had plenty of time to get her bag on one of the many flights from madrid to barcelona but failed to do so. The baggage office in Barcelona said they will send the bag to forward to meet the ship in one of the many orts we were scheduled to visit. We had to spend most of our time in Barcelona looking for clothes for my wife not sight seeing as we had hoped. Needless to say the airline never got the bag to any of the ports we visited and we got off the cruise not knowing if she would ever get the bag back. Upon returning to the US we were notified that the bag was being delivered to our house which it was, 3 weeks later after the startof our trip.

Having flown back from Lima on an Iberia flight I'm even more unhappy as clearly the flight to Lima was significantly poor.

When boarding, they created one group and asked us to stand in line until they could board everyone.  Weirdest thing I've ever experienced.

Next, when we boarded the plane it turned out they had changed our seats to two in a two seat row to the middle 2 seats in a row of 4, meaning that on a 9 hour flight everytime we wanted to get out we had to disturb the person to the side.

The food was mediocre.  On a 9-hour flight they served one meal, one drink and one snack.  The rest of the time you had to go to the back of the plane to request a drink or snack.  They allowed trash to build up until it was spilling over on the floor.  They finally came through a little before we landed to collect trash.

Worst experience ever,Madrid,Munich,Europe,"I recently had the unfortunate experience of flying with Iberia, and it’s with great disappointment that I share my review. Upon arrival, I was distressed to discover that my luggage had not made the journey with me. While I understand that mishaps happen, it’s how a company addresses them that truly matters. Sadly, Iberia’s customer service fell short in this regard. Attempts to seek assistance were met with indifference, and the responses I received lacked the empathy or urgency one would expect in such a situation.

DO NOT FLY WITH IBERIA,Bergen,Barcelona,Europe,"IBERIA IS HORRIBLE. (Traveled from BOS-BCN [ended up only making it to Madrid] but this was not an option when writing this) I spent the extra money for a direct flight, we took off and then had to emergency land. Kept us on the aircraft for over 2 hours before de-boarding everyone. Rebooked us with a connection. The flight didn’t land in time, but we ran to the gate. People were walking through the doors to the runway, we were less than 5 feet away and the attendant ran to close the doors and denied us boarding. We got 4 standby flights and we were not able to get on any of them. This kept us in the airport for 7 hours waiting. Then Iberia sent me on a wild goose chase to locate my luggage. After talking with an attendant who told me to wait at luggage belt (stood there for over an hour) they finally told me that my luggage was sent to my final destination hours ago. Had to spend over $1k on train tickets, another few hundred $ on hotels. I was traveling for a cruise and missed the first 3 days of it.

Iberia Airlines - No Integrity! BAD Customer Service,Porto,San Antonio,International,"On our way back to the U.S. from Porto through Madrid, our flight was cancelled. There was hardly any customer service helping out in Porto. They gave us attitudes when asked what to do next! No empathy at all. Calling Iberia was not helpful at all. They said they can not do anything and just wat for an email from Iberia....

Iberia Customer Service in Porto gave us a sheet of paper about our cancelled flight and ask us to file a claim for our overnight expenses up to $200 for an overnight stay. However, when I filed the claim, they rejected the claim and stated it was resolved.

IBERIA or hell?,Sao Paulo,Madrid,International,"Have you ever wondered how it feels, to possibly fly with the most grumpy flight attendants you could ever meet? Then I have a solution for you, fly with IBERIA! 

Your experience will start when you board the plane, where you will be met by flight attendants who looks like they are severely constipated. 

Moving along, on long trips boarding can easily take up to an hour at least. So if you have to use the bathroom to bad for you, because with this great airline if you ask them to use the bathroom bathroom they will answer “not right now…” with the same attitude of an I-pad kid who got their iPad taken away, and if you ask if it will be possible before boarding to use the bathroom you will be met by their most used answer; “I don’t know…” with the spice of rolling their eyes. 

In air the seats are nothing to celebrate, but then again you can have your expectations high in economy. If you’re lucky your seat will be equipped with a blanket and a pillow, if not guess you have to be quick and snatch some (because the flight gets very cold).
But besides that the seats are equipped with some pretty neat screens, that contains games, movies, audio etc., these screens also contains the buttons for the light and to call a flight attendant. But don’t be fooled! Just because there is a button for service, doesn’t mean you’ll get any! 

On this flight I called for service 5 times, and a flight attendant showed up 0 times out of those 5. I don’t know if it feels worse being ghosted by an ex or flight attendant who passes you several times. 

But you might wonder, why would a person be so consistent on calling service just to be ignored? Well it was to ask if the food onboard contained any pineapple, since I’m highly allergic and prefer not to die, even tho it already fell like I was in hell. And to my luck a flight attendant walked by, and I finally managed to catch her attention and ask if the food had any pineapple, and her answer was “mhmm I don’t know…”. 

Great guess I had to either yolo, or just not eat. 

Later on the flight I had to use the bathroom, the one on the left was occupied so I just used the one on my right. Just to be surprised, that the mirror was popped out and hanging on for dear life, revealing whatever isolation was going on behind it. Luckily there was a flight attendant right next to the bathroom contemplating life, and I told her about it, her respond? “Mmmkay”.
This left a bit of awkward silence so I asked “can I still use it?” And of course I should  have known the answer “I don’t know” perfected with a roll of the eyes. 

So choose IBERIA, if you wanna know what r hell feels like.",October 2024,"November 4, 2024",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Be very CAREFUL when buying tickets with IBERIA,San Juan,Madrid,International,"Confirmation of booking UJMQDG to San Juan, Puerto Rico

Be very CAREFUL when buying tickets with IBERIA. They send you the flight confirmation and then cancel the transaction without notifying you. DO NOT trust the Iberia platform. I bought my ticket directly from Iberia, received the confirmation by email, and made sure I had it in my Iberia app. The day of my flight arrived, I tried to check in on the app, and the reservation didn’t appear. I checked the email and confirmed my reservation, but I couldn’t check in. That’s where my nightmare began.

I called Iberia, and they informed me that the reservation didn’t exist. They asked me to write via WhatsApp, which I did, but I received very little help from the agents. They couldn’t give me any clear answers because they had to check everything first. I went to the airport, and to my surprise, Iberia doesn’t have its own staff there, so no one could help me. I ended up buying a ticket with American Airlines from SJU - MIA - MAD, even though my ticket was supposed to be a direct flight SJU - MAD - SJU. My husband traveled on that direct flight, while I had to take a different flight, paying almost double.

Later, I wrote to Iberia, and of course, I haven’t received a response. The Iberia computer system, first of all, should not have generated a confirmation if the transaction was incomplete. Secondly, if it did generate the confirmation, it should have sent a cancellation notification.

I want a refund for the difference in what I paid for the ticket I had to buy. This chaos was caused by IBERIA.

Lost Baggage Nightmare from Iberia,Dallas,Madrid,International,"Hard care review here as Iberia lost the luggage for my family: one family of four, second family of four, and three individuals from USA to Madrid. That’s 11 people, folks, all with lost luggage. We landed in Madrid and were on our way to meet a train to Barcelona then catch a cruise. This airline is miserable.  We read Reddit advice every step of the way which warned us that if Iberia lost our luggage we were in real trouble. Believe it. Miserable. So I’m glad to share the step-by-step misery we suffered from Iberia Airlines. First, Ill  jump to the end: we returned home after three weeks of travel and 2-3 weeks later, for several of us- we finally got our luggage. Iberia sent us a check, for 11 people, for $1500. For all of us. So I’m going to share what you have to expect from Iberia Airlines. Day one- lost luggage day- landed in Madrid- exhausted.  We spent 3- hours, along with over a hundred other passengers finding the right line then filing the proper claims. The people were nice- just not enough of them- and it was 2 hours in line.  By the way, despite filing our claims as instructed by the staff- most of us never received a single communication about our individual luggage.  Iberia has received multiple messages from me. I’ve NEVER received one word from them. So. Missed our train. Paid an extra $700 for train fees and long delay. Paid an extra $100 for transport fees as we arrived in Barcelona super late.  Lost an enjoyable afternoon of our  vacation in Madrid and an evening with the rest of our party in Barcelona.

First hour they serve a meal which was fine. After meal service, trash accumulated, they disappeared. Eight hours later, they drop off the little sandwiches before landing. In between, they are in their galley for 8 hours, not bothering to pick up trash maybe every two hours, is that so much to ask? By the last few hours of flight, the plane is a biohazard, several of the bathrooms are cordoned off, presumably because people are dropping their trash in the toilets.

Terrible service and treatment and cancellation of two flights round trip without notification,Los Angeles,Barcelona,International,"We booked the flight back in January of 2024 to travel October of 2024.  We were about to leave to the airport we checked the flight status google flights indicates it was cancelled. We did not receive an email indicating canceled this flight.  We contacted Iberia customer service and the gentleman we spoke with said the flight was not cancelled. We asked him if he was sure because google flights says canceled.  He said no sir not cancelled so based on what the Iberia customer service representative’s confident answer we proceeded to leave and drove to the airport decided to get there 4 hours before our flight just in case the representative  was wrong. We got to the Iberia line and at the counter the ladies working the ticketing and baggage checkin would not check in anyone and would not say if flight was canceled or not. They would not answer our question, they were rude and just told us to continue and wait in line.  After 2 hours of waiting in line with no one answering us if flight was cancelled and if we can take another flight to make it to Barcelona.  We were told no flights until the next morning.  We asked why we did not receive email re cancellation and why the customer rep on the phone did not give us the correct information and why we had to wait in line for two hours without any response as to whether flight was indeed cancelled or not so we could look into other options and we did not get any apologies nor any explanations. Everyone was so unprofessional and rude and  none of them had any idea how to respond to questions. This was our first time flying with Iberea and we had purchased food from the special menu and had paid extra 200 dollars each of us for our seats for more leg room.  We took a different airline and flew to Barcelona because we needed to get there for a wedding and the flight had a stop   Lay over and no leg room we got to Barcelona very late.  Since we had our return ticket with Iberia for nonstop flight again paid seats we were going to use that in the way back a week later which was today.  Prior going to the airport once again we tried to check in and no flight was coming up as if it was a ghost airline but the interesting thing was the airline once again had not sent us a cancellation email in fact we had received an email saying your get ready for your flight 2 days prior.  When we got to the airport again ahead of time the Checkin desk representatives were extremely rude and unprofessional and would not give us a straight answer. The flight had been cancelled god knows when and there was no trace of it no email re cancellation. We kept being told to contact the phone number they had for the customer service airline and they couldn’t help us with any thing there we had to call and deal with a representative on the phone.  They would not respond to any of our questions and kept being rude and unprofessional as if it was our fault and not the airlines fault   We were stuck at the airport taking to representatives over the phone and those representatives also had no answer for us. We are now stuck over night as they could not offer us a a flight to leave the same day despite other airlines availabilities they offered a flight that will get us back to Los Angeles two days from today with stops making me not being able to make it back to my work on Friday and missimg important work meetings. I am exhausted and extremely upset of how Iberea airlines had canceled both of our going and return flights without any email notifications of cancellation and how we were treated.

Very Average airline,London,Quito,International,"London – Madrid - Quito
Flying Business class from London Heathrow to Quito Ecuador via Madrid. Check-in at Heathrow was relatively pain free and the priority lane through immigration was helpful. The business class lounge at Heathrow is shared with BA and various other airlines and was absolutely rammed with passengers but eventually we managed to get two seats together. There was a good range of food on offer in the lounge and the drinks were regularly topped up. The business class seats on the short haul stage from Heathrow are not much more than a standard seat (an extra inch or two perhaps) but you get three seats between two. There was also a lack of overhead storage space. The food was acceptable with a choice of main course, also a reasonable selection of alcoholic or non-alcoholic drinks. On the long-haul part of our journey we had fully flat beds, a good choice of films etc on the entertainment system. The food was again acceptable with good choice of starter, main and deserts. The only downside was that it was served very soon after take-off, the crew would appear to do this so that they then get, on this flight, seven hours rest.

Iberia doesn't care about passengers making connections,London,Seville,Europe,"We have dubbed Iberia the official airline of the Spanish Inquisition! Although they are partners with major carriers such as BA and American, they do not play by the rules of their own game. Most flights to places inside Spain from other EU countries or from other more distant places must pass through Madrid Airport. Madrid Airport is very large and far more complicated than their website suggests. Furthermore, most employees you will encounter for help with directions and procedures do not speak anything except Spanish. And...they are working as third party outside contractors to Iberia, not the airline itself. Iberia picks certain flights for certain destination connections. You cannot change them easily when you book. Nor can even top travel agencies such as American Express. 

We had booked and paid in advance for a round trip from London to Seville through Amex. Iberia gave a connection time of under two hours. This sounds okay except our flight was very late in take off and arrival do to nothing we could see. the airport was chaos unlike what Iberia had told us at Heathrow. We had just 40 miniutes to go through passport control, security, and take a 13 minute train ride to a distant terminal. We arrived just as the final people were loading and were refused embarkation. Amex could not rebook us because we were in Iberia's control. the rebooking agent listed us as no shows. Did not even offer us anything but standby on a local budget airline even though we later learned that there was an empty Iberia express to Seville leaving in less than 90 minutes. We lerned that by wandering around until we found the only Iberia true help desk. Had to buy biz class walk up seats for nearly $800 each for a 50 minute flight. Getting back took so much time that we lost nearly a day of exploring Southern Spain.

downgrade without any possibility of contact,Lima,Zagreb,International,"I booked my flights with Iberia from Zagreb to Montevideo, and back from Lima to Zagreb, three legs in economy class (Zagreb - Madrid, Madrid - Montevideo, and back Madrid -Zagreb), and for a long inbound flight Lima - Madrid, I booked premium economy, and paid the appropriate price.

Just a week after the booking, IBERIA informed me that there are no places available in premium economy on my inbound flight Lima - Madrid, and that I was hence downgraded to economy. All my attempts to communicate with IBERIA and find a solution with which I would be reasonably happly failed. Online contact is practically impossible, so I tried at the Madrid and Lima airport, where they just had a one and only ""solution"" - fly and after all your flights have been accomplished, write to us to see about the possible refund.
24 hrs before my inbound flight, IBERIA informed me ( and probably other passengers as well) that they are experiencing problems with the inflight entertainment system so it would not work probably on the flight, and they gave us a motherly advice to download our own entertainment.

I call every other day and they will lie about hoe they didn't knew where my lugged was. I even inform them I knew it was in San Juan since i had an air tag. The people that was traveling with me they all received it before that me. They refuse to send my lugged to the US where I live. Three weeks pass by and they will not provide me with any information at all. They even ask me for a picture of my suitcase witch I provide. I even send then the location of my lugged. I ask for alternative and they refuse. They refuse to connected me with a supervisor. They even told me they will not return my suitcase if i went back to San Juan. I finally wrote them an email informing I will be traveling back to Puerto Rico to pick it up. Once on my way back they call me to inform me they had my suit case. I inform I was already on my way. They told me that was my decision and that they will not reimburse me for nothing.  Since that was my own business. They were very rude and  will talk over me all the time. I have been a customer service agent for years.

MAJOR bait 'n switch. Beware fellow travelers!,San Francisco,Barcelona,International,"Just wow. 
Iberia has figured out the best bait and switch in the history of bait and switches. Clever as hell. And scummy as hell.
Like others writing reviews here, we booked our trip on Iberia and when we went to check in at the airport, were directed to an airline called ""Level,"" which we'd never heard of. Turns out that while we believed we were purchasing tix on Iberia (I have the receipts to prove this), we were actually purchasing on some hideous, cheah a*s budget airline that makes a gas station pit stop look like luxury. 
Re: my bathroom photo attached. When I alerted the flight attendants to this mess they explained keeping the bathroom clean was not their job and that the mess is the fault of the people on the flight.
Okayyyyy....
Aside from the very beginning and end of the flight, they never served water or any other beverage. 
Tray tables were hanging on by a thread.
Seats were freakishly cramped (usually on a long-haul flight you get a tiny bit more room). Not here.
On flight home, bathroom mirror was held on with duct tape. What else had they used duct tape on, we asked ourselves?
I won't comment on the food because ya'll get the gist of what I'm saying.
You can see the notation under the flight number (attachment) that says ""operated by LEVEL."" I've gotten this on many flights before, and it's never meant ""we are going to give you service about 10 times below the airline you think you purchased on.""
They may think they've covered their a*sses by adding this, but I doubt it.

HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!! FLY WITH ANYONE ELSE,Barcelona,Miami,International,"I recently booked my ticket through Iberia for a roundtrip to Spain. The flight there was perfect, everything was orderly and we received proper attention and accommodations, including dinner, snack, pillow, blanket, and headphones. We had a working television. On the flight back, though, Murphy’s law took hold. And LEVEL, and by extension Iberia (whom is responsible for the operation of LEVEL) are to blame. 

1. There was no order when it came to boarding the plane. There was no group calling, or preference for those that had disabilities, children, or strollers. Everything was a free for all. 
2. While they were admitting passengers, among the mayhem, they had us descend the escalators, where we thought we were to board the plane. There was a flight of spiral stairs, with no option for elevators. NO OPTION FOR ELEVATORS FOR THOSE WITH DISABILITIES. A complete criminality and danger for its passengers. Having been traveling with my grandmother, her among others had experienced trouble, pain, and dangerous circumstances coming down to a BUS, that would take us to the airplane and would make us go up the STAIRS onto the plane as well. Completely criminal. 
3. As this flight was operated by Iberia, we expected to receive our dinner meal, as well as some assortment of snacks and water. They did NOT feed us, seemingly choosing passengers at random no matter if they had or had not “pre-ordered their meals”, which was complete lunacy considering they still asked passengers what meal they desired, and were left with many leftovers. They also did not notify or message that we had to request meals in advance. My grandmother, who is hypoglycemic and suffers from high blood pressure, could have suffered serious consequences aboard this flight, with no consideration from the airline. It was DISCRIMINATORY AND INHUMANE.
4. We were also not given the basic amenities such as a pillow, blanket, or headphones. There was a TV screen behind each seat that served as decoration, as it did not turn on the entire flight. There was not even a functioning outlet.
5. Aside from the abhorrent and inhumane conditions that we were subjected to during a 10 HOUR FLIGHT, the staff of LEVEL were unpolished, unprepared, and incredibly rude. They showed no empathy and gave a pretentious “better than you” air. For a ticket over $500, I expected much better conditions. 

For anyone flying internationally, please make sure that you do not fall for this inhumane, money-hungry scheme, and fly through American Airlines, NOT OPERATED BY LEVEL OR IBERIA. We have reached a new low.",October 2024,"October 17, 2024",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

The seats barely reclined but we paid to get seats together and my husband's seat was broken and was in the reclined position all the time and he got a metal box under the front seat so he couldn't rest his feet correctly.  The plane shook and sounded like something was going to fall off at takeoff. The worst part was that we discovered our ticket DIDN'T INCLUDE A MEAL!!   We pushed the button to call the flight attendant and they came to turn the light off twice without asking us anything, after the 3rd time my husband raised his voice to get the flight attendant's attention to order food  (45 min. after everyone else finished their meal and they only had cold food option to order.).

The most chaotic boarding experience,Dublin,Madrid,Europe,"This is by far the most chaotic boarding I have ever experienced. The flight left over an hour late, and when it came time to board they didn’t make any announcements on the overhead mic Once all of the passengers started to try to board someone yelled out which groups should board which included 3 groups all at once and five minutes later they announced over the mic that all four group could board even though there was still a huge line of groups 1-3 boarding. They seemed to board people from the front and back of the plane which seemed to cause more chaos with so many people trying to board at once. People were pressed up against each other trying to let others through to get to their seats or to put their carry on luggage up. At some point a cluster of 5 passengers including myself and my husband were trapped in a group that could not move until others cleared out. I started laughing out loud because it seemed we were part of some elaborate joke.

We arrived in Madrid to find out premium economy doesn't actually exist for our flight and we're checked in for economy, with absolutely no notification about this. Having paid twice the price of a normal ticket for an area of the plane that doesn't even exist, we went to the customer service desk in Madrid airport so see what we could do and the lady at the desk just shrugged her shoulders at us and said ""not possible"". We rang the customer care line three times and got through to someone who in fairness tried to help, but on her system she said she couldn't even see proof of us boarding the dublin flight to Madrid!

Iberia system is flawed with aircraft equipment change/seats A350-A330,New York City,Madrid,International,"Bad customer service, leave you with oh well.   Booked flight 4 plus months in advance.  Like all airlines, they list the aircraft type and a diagram of the seats for seat location so you can sit next to family or friends. The aircraft which was being operated was a Airbus A350-900 for this route.  During this time, I purchased seats near the front of the plane in rows A and B which are a window seat and middle.  On this particular aircraft, it had 3 seats along the window in a row, then a middle section and the same configuration on the other side with two aisles.  Five days before the flight, I logged into the website to check on things.  
So upon logging in, I noticed they changed the aircraft to a Airbus A330-300 series aircraft. My wife's seat is no longer assigned?  I purchased two seats at extra cost to move up front so we could sit together.   I myself still have a assigned seat, because the new aircraft has row A.  It did not have row B,  The Airbus A330-300 only has row A and C, so anybody that was booked in row B just fell off and would be re-assigned 24 hours before the flight.  WHAT KIND OF SYSTEM IS THAT???  Tickets were booked together, why is everyone separated now?  What if kids were separated from their parents because they were booked in row B.   So everybody that was booked in row B was left unassigned.  
Customer service was terrible on this, they would not fix the issue because now some random person, not my wife was now sitting next to me.   You would think if the aircraft changed to a different aircraft type, they would keep parties togehter which booked tickets on the same confirmation number!!!  My wife did not have a separate confirmation number.

Iberia customer service is the worst.,Lisbon,New York City,International,"Please read before you book with Iberia. This actually happened to us on Sept 26,27 2024. You can't make this up. We were scheduled to fly from Lisbon to Madrid onto DFW and then home. The morning of the flight from Lisbon Sept 26, I received an e mail from Iberia in Spanish. I don't read or speak Spanish. Upon reviewing the e mail, there appeared to be a section at the end of the email stating that we owed around 430 Euros each. I had no idea what this was for so we went to the Lisbon airport about three hours before flight time. The line was over two hours long. Once at the counter we were informed that our flight had changed and that our original flight was delayed. Our ticket was changed to a different airline, TAP and we missed our flight. I was asked if I received an e mail. I showed the one in Spanish and explained. The gentleman behind the counter stated that this was wrong that they did not give us enough info before flight time. He got on the phone and fought with someone. We were finally rebooked on the delayed flight to Madrid. However, due to their error, we missed our connection. Once in Madrid the battle really began. We went to the customer service desk. the line there was over an hour long. When I got to the front of the line I was told to go to the other line, another 45 minute wait. People were really pissed. When we finally got to a customer service rep. it got worse. She could NOT have been more unfriendly. She accused us of flying in two days before even thought I showed her our itinerary and boarding passes for the flights. There were no other flights out of Madrid to the US. until the next day. She did everything in her power NOT to provide overnight accommodations and meals. After 40 minutes we were given a voucher for the hotel and meals. The next day, we made our flight to JFK. We sat on the tarmac for 90 minutes before taxi. We had a connection in JFK to Dallas. Our flight landed about 40 minutes before our connection departed. By the time we cleared customs and retrieved our bags our connections was long gone. Back to customer service. Note that there were at least ten (10) other families, couples singles in our same situation Most of them gave up and walked away. This is what Iberia hopes you will do. Now it really gets bad. Again they did their level best NOT to provide lodging dur to their delay. We spent over three hours going back and forth. They would take our info. say they would be right back and disappear. I asked for a supervisor. I was told that she was working a flight and it would be 30 minutes. Over an hour later she shows up and had no idea what was going on. The girl behind the counter finally said he is flight from JFK to DFW You will get home late tonight. I did not have readers on so I took her at her word. I went to the American A/L counter, (they partner with American) and was told, you are flying from JFK to LAX and you get home tomorrow. I went back to the counter found the customer service lady and called her out as being a LIAR to her face. She got upset and walked away. It took us at least another hour to get anything resolved. When we finally got a voucher for a room, I asked about meals. the same girl said, We don't provide meals, you pay and file a claim. I know why she did this. I found out at the hotel that meals are included. Had I not asked and filed a claim, Iberia rightfully would have said T/B you had a voucher and did not use it. A couple of things to note. If you speak Spanish you will be treated a touch better. They do their absolute best to not provide any service after the flight, their fault or not. THEY DO NOT CARE. This was WORST experience that we have every had with any airline. I am not saying don't fly them. Note that at both airports, Madrid/JFK there were what seemed like more people with lost/missing bags than those bags that arrived on their flights. Surprisingly, that was one issue that we did not have. They have made it perfectly clear that the goal of their customer service is to provide NO service and do their best to get you to walk away.",September 2024,"October 2, 2024",1.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0
IBERIA IS A SCAM- DO NOT BOOK.,Boston,Ibiza,International,"I usually do not write reviews. BUT i am going on every trip website possible to let everyone know NOT TO BOOK WITH IBERIA!!!!!!!!!

1) I paid over $1300 for my flight to arrive in Ibiza at a certain time to ensure that I will be to attend 2 meetings. However, when I arrived at BOS Int;l Airport I was suppose to board at 16:40, I did not board until 20:00 due to a delay-no explanation. When I arrived to Madrid, I was notified that my flight was delayed for 5 HRS with NO EXPLANATION. Missed 3 appointments.

2)When I finally arrived to Ibiza, my luggage did not arrive with me. My luggage was left in Madrid for days without a definite time of when my luggage will arrive. I was told by a rep that I could buy clothes, toiletries whatever I needed because they were not sure when my luggage will arrive and I will be compensated because it was their fault. Still as of 10/02/2024 I am still getting the run around.

3) The day after I submitted a claim for my heavily delayed flights, I received an email stating that after reviewing the case, it was not their fault for the delayed flight (weather played no part by the way) and that I will not be compensated for the delay.

4) Their customer service is TRASH, they never want you to speak to a supervisor. They will lie and say they are all in meetings and they will call you back and never do. I demanded to speak to a supervisor after the 3rd time of being ran around. And he simply said to file a claim online.

Wouldn’t let me board my flight,Miami,Madrid,International,"I’m never booking Iberia ever again. They have the worst customer service. I booked a flight to Madrid, Spain to celebrate my birthday. When I flew from Miami to Madrid, everything was fine. But when I was supposed to return to Miami, I went through hell at the Madrid airport. I arrived on time to check in my bags so I can go home and by the time I got an employee to check in my luggage, she said there’s only two minutes left to check in for my flight because it closes 55 minutes prior to departure. They wouldn’t let me board my flight and told me I have to change my flight even though I came a few minutes before the 55 minute mark. I never got an email, phone call, or update about this policy. They escorted me to customer service and then they told me I had to pay a $200 euro “rescue fee” to put me on a waitlist for the next flight because all flights were full for the day I was trying to leave and the next day.

I had to pay for my own hotel and transportation for two days until they had more seats available for another flight. I missed two days of work. The employees at the customer service desk at the Madrid airport did not care. They were rude and they were not helpful. Iberia hasn’t offered to reimburse me for anything. This is the worse birthday ever. There were so many Americans that missed their flight because Iberia failed to update their customers about last minute changes in the policy. Many people’s flight were overbooked, cancelled, or their seats were given away. Stay away from Iberia. They don’t care about their customers.

 To make it worse, I overheard another customer complained that the customer service desk tried to charge her $35 euros to speak with someone in customer service. Iberia is a scam. They only want your money to treat you like trash. They don’t value their customers at all.",September 2024,"October 2, 2024",1.0,,,,,,,,

IB Flight (8a) leaves 1.25 hours late from Spain- our 2h window becomes a mad dash to meet security at customs saying BA pulled us off the flight - go see Iberia customer counter.  3.5h later Iberia staff have been unable, they confess they’re actually BA staff covering (no actual Iberia staff - even had me call Iberia call center), supervisor (BA) says only option- take a flight tomorrow on our AA partner, we’ll put you in a room overnight, dinner voucher, grab your bags and recheck in following day; next day (640) we attempt check-in at AA- no itinerary, go speak to BA, BA turn and say can’t help- go to another terminal and find Iberia staff to accommodate.

Literally One Of The Worst Airlines I've Ever Flown,Nice,Miami,International,"Flying with Iberia Airlines has become synonymous with a venture into the abyss of customer service nightmares and endless delays. My recent experience, which I'm sure resonates with many, paints a grim picture of an airline that seems to have lost its way amidst the clouds of organizational chaos and customer neglect.

From the outset, the promise of smooth skies with Iberia quickly turned into a ridiculous journey through a bureaucratic red tape of a kind I’ve never witnessed.

Check-ins that should have been straightforward turn into ordeals, with lines moving at a pace that suggests staff training involves learning how to master the art of slow-motion. When finally at the counter, the hope for efficiency was dashed against the rocks of indifference. 

The customer service, or the lack thereof, is akin to navigating through a labyrinth designed by someone who despises clarity. Calls for assistance are met with a purgatory hell fraught with news of delays and minimal empathy. If you’re looking for a supportive staff, don’t — your cries for assistance will vanish into a void of nebulous answers, leaving passengers in a limbo of uncertainty.

And let's talk about delays - Iberia seems to have patented the art of extending travel time. Flights that are supposed to glide you across the sky instead keep you grounded, sometimes for hours, with explanations as thin as the airline's apologies. These delays aren't just occasional hiccups but appear to be a core feature of the Iberia experience, as if the airline operates on a different time zone of inconvenience.

The straw that stirs the drink of discontent is their handling of these delays. Promises of assistance, whether it's rebooking or accommodations, are certainly offered (albeit in an impersonal way), but when it comes to delivery, Iberia often seems to misplace its commitment. The process of getting a flight rebooked or a voucher for a meal voucher or hotel due to their delays feels like a quest for the Holy Grail, fraught with misinformation and runarounds.

Moreover, posts on an endless array of platforms reveal a chorus of dissatisfaction, a community of travelers united in their frustration with Iberia's service. From lost luggage to being stranded overnight without proper care, the stories are not just anecdotal but form a pattern of neglect that's hard to ignore. 

In essence, flying with Iberia feels like buying a ticket not just for a flight but for a masterclass in patience, resilience, and the art of dealing with disappointment. For an airline that boasts a legacy, one would expect a modicum of respect for its passengers, but instead, it offers a lesson in what not to do.

If you value your time, sanity, and the basic tenets of customer service, steer clear of Iberia. They've turned flying into an adventure, but not the kind anyone books a ticket for.

To clarify specific details:

Flight Delay and Missed Connection: My flight from Nice to Madrid was delayed, resulting in me missing my connecting flight to Miami. Despite sprinting through Madrid Barajas Airport, I arrived five minutes late. Unfortunately, there was no sympathy or assistance offered by the Iberia staff.
Rebooking Chaos: The rebooking process at Iberia's help desk was poorly managed and excessively lengthy. Only two employees were handling a long queue of passengers. Unexpectedly, without prior notice, these employees closed their operations, forcing us to relocate to another desk across the airport for assistance.
Hotel Voucher: I was rebooked on the following day's flight to Miami and provided with a hotel voucher. However, the accommodation was substandard, resembling a college dorm with a noticeable odor.
Further Delays in Madrid: On the next day, September 25, 2024, I arrived at Madrid airport for my 11:40 AM flight, only to find out it was delayed due to technical issues until 3:00 PM. After hours of waiting, this flight was eventually canceled.
Misinformation and Misrouting: I approached what I thought was an Iberia desk for help, but was redirected as they did not assist Iberia passengers. After traversing the airport again, I was rerouted via a complex itinerary: Madrid to London Heathrow, Heathrow to JFK, and finally JFK to Miami. Despite my inquiries about connection times, particularly at Heathrow, I was assured there would be sufficient time.
Stranded in Heathrow: Unfortunately, the time was insufficient, and I missed my connecting flight at Heathrow. This left me stranded at 7:00 PM without accommodation, luggage, or toiletries, and with no immediate solution for continuing my journey.
Last-Minute Arrangements: I contacted Iberia, and they could only arrange a flight with British Airways for the next day, requiring me to independently secure lodging for the night.
Service Comparison: While British Airways proved reliable, Iberia demonstrated severe operational and customer service deficiencies.
Luggage Issues: Upon finally arriving home, my luggage was lost for three days. Today, Iberia confirmed it was located in Madrid and is now en route to JFK, rather than directly to Miami, which seems unnecessarily convoluted.
Future Action: I plan to file complaints with the Department of Transportation and the Better Business Bureau. I strongly recommend that everyone avoid Iberia Airlines to prevent similar experiences.",September 2024,"September 29, 2024",1.0,,,,,,,,
As expected,Vienna,Madrid,Europe,"Arrived at the airport expecting that check in would open 3 hours before my scheduled 12.20pm departure but they only open two and a half hours so a little wait for that to open but once it was open check in was easy and quick on a dedicated business class counter.

Iberia doesn’t have their own lounge and I don’t think there is one for another oneworld airline so they direct their passengers to the Vienna lounge which was a fantastic lounge with a nice selection of both food and drink options that started with breakfast items when I arrived and transitioned to all day items around 11am. 
While the lounge was busy I found a nice spot by the window which had some great views of the airport and departing flights.

The flight left a little late maybe 20 minutes but wasn’t an issue for me as I didn’t have a connecting flight. I was in 1A which gives you better legroom as it is a bulkhead seat but like 99% of European business class on a narrowbody plane the seats are just economy with the middle seat blocked and in theory a better inflight experience than economy and that is exactly what this flight was. 

I had a nice three course meal with a choice of main courses and drinks and the crew were always seeing if anyone wanted anything. 

Overall the lounge experience was above what I was expecting and the flight pretty much what I was expecting so overall I was very pleased.",May 2024,"September 29, 2024",5.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,5.0
"Terrible experience, flight cancelled on leg one, reservation lost on return home",Boston,Barcelona,International,"LEG ONE -- Iberia/Vueling/Level cancelled our Boston - Barcelona flight the morning we were scheduled to leave 9/23/2024. That was more than two weeks ago and we've yet to receive any communication, compensation, NOTHING. The only heads-up we had on the cancellation was from KAYAK! The Boston customer service agents were TERRIBLE. When we showed up at the airport they literally said they couldn't help us. It was unbelievably unprofessional  After insisting on speaking to a supervisor, we finally got transferred to an American Airlines flight via Philadelphia, only to learn that it was DELAYED and we would miss the flight to BCN. A wonderful AA customer service attendant saved our trip - NO thanks to Iberia.

RETURN LEG - Two days prior to the flight we went on the app to purchases seats. Only ONE of us was on the reservation. My husband's reservation had vanished into thin air. We called multiple times and got nowhere. When we got to BCN, we were referred to the Vueling  representative who told us they had no record of his reservation (nor of the seat I'd purchased).  After presenting proof of our reservation she ""squeezed us on the flight"" (there were empty seats). NONE of the technology worked on the plane -- no entertainment, no screens, nothing.

2. They have so less seats in the premium economy that you can rarely sit together with your travel companion. During both flights we had to sit separately or pay on top to seat together! Like wtf ryanair is this?!

3. For my coming back flight they just changed the aircraft for one that didn’t have premium economy so when I was checking in I found out that I would be sitting in economy. No explanation or even apology.

"If Iberia has no haters, I'm dead",New York City,Seville,International,"I have never had such a disgraceful experience with an airline in my entire life. I purchased flexible tickets to go to Spain, and when I called within the time frame to change the flight departure date, they told me that the only ticket status that they could change me to was a ""flexible fare"" and quoted me at $3,000 to change the flight. This was for just the outbound flight .... That is 3x the amount of money I paid for the entire roundtrip ticket. Paying extra for a flight change is a scam. Even though their policy says you can change your flight to any flight on iberia.com, the only way to change it is over the phone with their customer service and according to ""their system"" it only allows them to change to what is essentially a business class fare flight. 

When I inquired about whether there was a cancellation fee, they just went ahead and cancelled the flight. I never told them to cancel the flight. I called customer service so many times and they told me several different things. Because the flight had been cancelled, the reservation could not be changed. I was left with no flight tickets. I begged and begged the Iberia Twitter Business Account to help me and they told me someone would be calling me soon to resolve it. More than two days later, someone calls me. I speak with them for 13 minutes over the phone and all of a sudden, they hand up on me. I called that number back 2 times and of course it didn't work. I got charged international phone fees trying to do this. Over an hour later, they call me back and once again tell me that to change ONE LEG of the flight, even when I paid extra for a flight change when I initially bought the ticket, it would be $3,000. 

The amount of stress, false hope, and back and forth this flight has put me through is beyond. I am down $1,100 and 84,000 credit card points. This flight was supposed to be to attend a best friends wedding. I cannot believe the way they treat their customers. I'm writing this review in hopes that no one else has to go through this.

How are they still in business?,Madrid,Miami,International,"What a garbage airline. Turned me off to one world partners and AA, never flying either ever again.

1. Bought seats 6 months ago, completely ignored at check in, was given an interior seat and now I have to file a chargeback for my card.

2. Gave me 1 hour to make a connection in Madrid, I just barely made it because I spoke Spanish to customs and they rushed me through. Dozens of people on my connecting flight did not make it, there were entire rows of seats empty because of this. Why even sell this as a connecting flight if it’s nearly impossible to make.

3. Because I had to rush through MAD I couldn’t buy food. No problem, my infotainment tells me I can buy food just ask the the stewardess, when I go up to her, she tells me this flight doesn’t sell food. So who’s lying her or the Ads on the screen in front of me. Later I see people have purchased the food I wanted. What a joke, I’m literally trying to give them money and they can’t be bothered.

4. Don’t bother buying the satellite internet as it keeps cutting out, what a waste of 20 euros.

5. Bathrooms are filthy, or maybe people were upset as I was and just pissed over everything cause that flight was foul.

6. Stewardess did not like me and gave me worse treatment than everybody else, but like small petty stuff. Everyone got ice with their drink, me no ice. Everyone got bread with their meal, me no bread. Everyone’s meal look sealed, the tinfoil on my chicken was opened like someone decided they didn’t want it and gave it back and she saved that one for me, great. When coffee service came around everyone got a half cup at least, I got one pump from the pot, barely a quarter cup. I finally spoke up and she gave me another pump. Everyone around me got treated better, I spoke Spanish for every request, the only difference is I’m Asian and everybody else wasn’t. Felt like racial discrimination but my evidence is all circumstantial.

7. Lastly my baggage got caught in the claim turnstile (they had to emergency stop it) and it damaged my bag. Not their fault but when I went to the service desk to put in a claim, she literally turned away from me and said she’s on break and said they were closed. Great service!

"Nice Staff, HORRIBLY outdated and aging planes",Chicago,Madrid,International,"Took this as it was the only direct flight to Spain and I had no past experience with Iberia. The only positive I would say is that the flight staff are kind and attentive. The airline itself was horrible though. Super small seats, plane was one of the oldest I’ve ever been on. Did not even have air vents. Super old technology that barely worked, chargers didn’t work, seats wouldn’t recline, tiny (I’m 5’6 and my knees were pushed up to the seat in front of me).

DO NOT FLY Iberia!!!,Chicago,Madrid,International,"The trip to Spain was Wonderful but the flights were an absolute nightmare!!!
We were supposed to leave on Friday. We paid extra for reserved seats to and from Madrid. After sitting on the runway for more than 1 hour, they turned around and told us the flight was cancelled. Back in the terminal the ticket agent gave a very detailed explanation in Spanish. When another passenger employed her to speak in English she simply said the flight was cancelled go get you bags. After waiting 2 hours to get our bags we headed back home hoping to get on the flight the next day. When they couldn’t get us out until 3 days later, we ended up taking American with a connection in Dublin. No saved seats sitting in the middle. We understood it was last minute. At least we had our already paid for seats on the way back. No. They cancelled and rebooked our flight back on the exact flight we paid for. No notice or email sent about this. Ended up again sitting in the middle watching other people sitting in our side seats we paid for. My advise: do NOT fly Iberia!! Terrible airline.

Iberia does not honor seat reservations or luggage allowances,Los Angeles,Madrid,International,"We have flown internationally to Europe for decades.

When we arrived at the airport we did not receive the booked seats but instead were assigned middle seats with no explanation or apology. We submitted a claim after the fact and only upon our request did Iberia state that they reserve the right to change planes and therefore not honor reserved seats. We don't agree that this gives Iberia the right not to notify their customers, provide a suitable alternative or voluntarity give a refund.

Furthermore, on the return flight from Madrid Iberia did not honor the conditions of carriage by not providing the first luggage to be checked in free of charge. The ticket we purchased was for one piece of luggage free fo charge. We showed that to the ticket agent at the check in counter in Madrid and she just replied that her computer showed something different and to take it up with American Airlines later since the two systems apparently are not coordinated...

Once we got back home one more received there luggage and my daughter never got hers at all we had an air tag in it and it showed at the airport i called every day and every day was told I’m on an escalated claim . When i ask what that was i was told we have sent a message to Madrid asking about it . I then ask what was the answer and was told no one has responded - this happened every day we were there and even when we got home each day AirTag showed it there then they moved it to an off airport hangar looks like where cargo would go out so was hopeful still kept calling sent pictures from my phone showing them exactly where it was and they never went and even tried to find it . They said there was no one there i could call to help me . Then one day i checked about a month after we were back home and saw it on the side of a road in the middle of nowhere - i knew then it was gone .
I filed a report and am still waiting on a reimbursement for all her brand new clothes and bags and make up she had bought just for this trip . On top of that we had one traveler on a flight coming to join us in Dallas the flight was delayed and we told them she would be like five minutes the gate person said no problem . They then locked the doors and left her she was there before the screen said the flight would leave and they did nothing to help her out .

Thankfully, I was on my way home, rather than at the beginning of my trip.  Iberia ultimately reimbursed me for a replacement bag that I bought for another trip during the waiting period, not knowing whether they would ever return my original bag.

An open letter to Delta Airlines Customer Service,San Jose,Ibiza,International,"An open letter to Delta Airlines Customer Service:

I am writing to express my profound frustration and disappointment with the handling of my recent flight reservation. On August 7th, I received a confirmation for a flight from San Jose, Costa Rica, to Ibiza, Spain, scheduled for today, August 29th. The confirmation code for this reservation was K19HY.

Based on this confirmation, I proceeded to book an entire weekend itinerary in Ibiza, which amounted to approximately $10,000. As you can imagine, this was a significant investment, made with full confidence that my travel plans were secured by Delta Airlines.

However, when attempting to check in online for my flight today, I was informed by your support team that my reservation had been canceled. I was utterly shocked, as I had never requested any cancellation, nor was I informed that my credit card had not been charged. I have booked hundreds of flights in the past and have never encountered a situation where a confirmed reservation was not honored.

The lack of communication regarding the cancellation of my reservation is unacceptable. If there was an issue with the payment, I should have been notified immediately so that it could be rectified. Instead, I was left in the dark, and now that I am aware of the situation, all alternative flight options have been exhausted. 

As a result, I am now faced with the grim reality that my entire $10,000 itinerary in Ibiza is non-refundable, all due to the failure on Delta's part to properly manage and communicate the status of my reservation.

To add insult to injury, when I attempted to file a complaint on your website, I was unable to do so because I was not provided with a ticket number, which I should have received after the initial confirmation. The email you sent me clearly stated, ""La reserva se ha realizado correctamente,"" with the confirmation code K19HY. There was no indication that my reservation was pending or required further action on my part, aside from a vague note in small font about confirming the ticket by a specific date.

Given the significant financial loss I have incurred due to this mishandling, I expect a full refund of my $10,000 expenses. This situation has not only caused me immense stress but has also severely damaged my trust in Delta Airlines as a reliable carrier.

I request that this matter be escalated immediately and resolved with the urgency it warrants. I look forward to your prompt response and an acceptable resolution to this matter.

Sincerely,  
Jean Marc",August 2024,"August 29, 2024",1.0,,,,,,,,

Lost our luggage for a week- Our air tag saved us,Dallas,Madrid,International,"I am writing to report an issue we experienced during our recent trip with American Airlines and Iberia Airlines. This matter significantly impacted our long-awaited vacation. Our original flight plan for August 7, 2024, was from SeaTac to LAX on American Airlines, then LAX to Madrid on Iberia (IB42). We booked these flights early to save money. However, the flight schedule changed, resulting in an eight-hour layover at LAX. To avoid this, I contacted American Airlines, which rescheduled our flights to depart from SeaTac to Dallas (American Airlines(AA2769), then from Dallas to Madrid (Iberia IB42). During our flight from SeaTac to Dallas, we were informed that our connecting flight to Madrid had been canceled. Upon arrival at Dallas, there was no clear communication, and our luggage's status became uncertain. We were rebooked on a flight to Madrid the next day, but when we inquired about our luggage, we were assured that it would be on the flight with us. Despite these assurances, our AirTag tracker showed that our luggage was not on our flight. Upon arrival in Madrid on August 9, we immediately filed a lost luggage claim with Iberia, only to find that American Airlines still had our bags. We were told that our luggage would arrive the following day, but this did not happen. From August 8 to August 14, we waited for our luggage to be found, spending hours in the Iberia customer service line in Madrid. Despite providing AirTag information showing our luggage's location at American Airlines' luggage hold in Madrid, no one was able to retrieve it. The failure of both airlines to locate and deliver our luggage ruined our trip. We were without our clothes and essential items for an entire week due to poor management and inadequate customer service from both American Airlines and Iberia.

The worst travel experience of my life.,Dublin,Orlando,International,"The worst travel experience of my life. I have never encountered a more deplorable level of customer “service” than that received from Iberia. Put simply they lie with impunity!

First they incorrectly tell me that an outbound leg of our (wife and three children under 8) trip from Dublin to Florida is cancelled and change us onto a flight through Gatwick with BA. Despite me ringing them before we ever leave to tell them I am still receiving messages from AA about the other (supposedly) cancelled outbound leg and my fear that my return flights will be cancelled for a no show, they assure me all is ok. The representative hangs up on me. Sure enough, upon arrival I get a message to say our return flights have all been cancelled.

During this call the lies continue when they state that we are flying in and out of the same terminal in Dallas and not to worry about the tight layover time and secondly they give me seat numbers to show we are seated together. Turns out we are not flying in and out of same terminal and wait for it, AA know nothing about any seats having been secured by Iberia and all seats are now gone.

I contact Iberia again, they tell me they will resolve the issue with seats and I have to ring back at which time Supervisor will have solution (they maintain they are unable to call me back).

When I call back, the new representative says she knows nothing about earlier conversation and there is nothing they can do and that I must contact AA. The representative hangs up!

I call AA and get a very helpful
Gentleman who tells me he regularly hears similar stories about Iberia including that they hang up on customers. He indicates that the seating can only be sorted at airport.

I get to the airport for our trip home, return the hire car and request that we be seated together, only to be told that there is insufficient time to make the changeover in Dallas and we have been cancelled again and rebooked on a flight the following day through Charlotte. We are required to secure overnight accommodation etc. The AA desk attendant does however advise me that there is a flight later that night with Aer Lingus (partner airline) and that there is seat availability but that only Iberia can book it and I should contact them.

With great reluctance in contact Iberia again and have to try and explain all again. I then get a further set of lies. Firstly they tell me there is no Aer Lingus Flight. I tell them I am looking at the listing. They then tell me there are insuffient seats on the flight. I tell her I have just been told at the desk that there are seats. She continues to maintain there are no seats so I tell her that I am on the Aer Lingus website and there are 5 seats available. Only at this stage she accepts there are seats but that we cannot be transferred.

I say I want to speak to a Supervisor and she goes away to get one. She comes back to say there is no supervisor but then lets slip that she has just spoken to her Supervisor. She then maintains that her supervisor is not available but that she will call me within an hour. She takes my number but no call is received.

I am currently in an airport hotel waiting for the next installment of Iberia’s incompetence and lies!!

DO NOT CHECK BAGS IN SPAIN. THEY WILL LOSE THEM!!!,Barcelona,Dallas,International,"American operated my flight to Barcelona which is why I arrived with two bags but left spain with only the bag I carried after entrusting it to iberia. Bag i guess is somewhere at connection in Madrid. 
 
I even paid for an upgrade to business in which the service was marvelous. It was worth it since I hear economy is trash.

Arrived DFW , my bag never madeit, so i scanned the qr code at iberia baggage desk and filed electronic claim and received tracking number.  Twodays later all I get is a stock email saying my bag has been found and is being delivered.  It's seems they automatically send it if you call or access the website. Same stock message with no specific details.  I call and you get the runaround,  press 4, press 8 , say this keyword.... my word. They can't connect you to anyone who knows anything, just call back and use this keyword.

Vindictive aggressive staff - avoid at all costs,Madrid,Palma de Mallorca,Domestic,"What a disgraceful level of service.  Checked in business class - only 2 agents for all flights from Madrid.  Agent unfriendly from the start.  Then demanded EUR70 for overweight bag even though I was several kg under the additional weight allowance for One World Sapphire (and overall checking in a fraction of allowance).  She said Sapphire is equivalent to IB silver and not entitled.  I tried to show her website to show she was wrong (each of IB, BA and One World websites clearly state the allowance and equivalent levels) but  she refused to look and told me I could miss the plane to go to customer services queue or pay her now.  So I had to use a spare lightweight bag and repack in front of everyone and hold up the growing queue further.  I said I wanted to complain - she refused to give me her name and then stopped checking us in.  She even called a man with a gun (ridiculous given we were not at all loud or violent - we were with our kids, who were traumatised by it).  Vindictive power crazed attempt at intimidation.  But I know very well Iberia won’t respond to a complaint as they have zero customer service ethic.  It’s an absolute disgrace that airlines are now basically allowed to do anything to you and charge you fraudulently and have feral staff who you aren’t even allowed to question and certainly not complain about.

NEVER FLY IBERIA - Nightmare Customer Service,Los Angeles,Madrid,International,"DO NOT FLY THIS AIRLINE! I have traveled extensively on over 20 airlines over my life and Iberia Airlines Customer Service in the reservation process,  problem solving (when they made a mistake) and follow up is the worst I have ever experienced in my whole life.

1.  Iberia outsources ALL of their Customer Service (Booking and Iberia Plus) to a  firm in South America.  THEY DO NOT WORK FOR IBERIA - so have zero ability to solve any problems or mistake made by Iberia.

2. Over these months, I have spoken to over 40 Iberia Customer Service Representatives and Supervisors and none of them are fluent in English - and speak with such a heavy accent them might as well be speaking Greek.  This made any conversation extremely difficult and prolonged (you have to speak to them very slowly and explain multiple times while it is almost impossible to understand their responses.

Background:

8 Months in advance, I attempted to book two Business Class Tickets using Avios Miles. I called the Iberia Plus Representative to book the flight and to confirm that 2 Business Class seats were available using points, as I had to transfer American Express Miles into my Iberia Account.  The Iberia Plus representative assured me that seats were available using Avios Miles.  I asked it they could hold those seats for 24 hours (American and other airlines do this) as I need to transfer the points.  He said they could not, but said the seats WE'RE AVAILABLE. I explained that once I transfer the points, they could not be transferred back, so I absolutely needed to confirm that the seats were available.  He said yes, so I transferred the points.

When I called back thenext morning, the Iberia Plus Representative told me the previous Representative had made a mistake and NO Business Class seats were available using Avios and never had been.  I was taken aback and spent the next two weeks and phone calls with multiple Supervisors explaining the situation and I just waisted 168,000 miles on the assurance of their employee.  

I spoke with several Supervisors and representatives (you have to repeat the whole facts each to you call as they will not transfer without knowing everything) asking them to solve the problem as these miles will be completely waisted. None of them could solve the problem.  Finally the only solution they provided is that I could transfer the Avios to another airline.

I ended up Buying two Business Class Tickets and then would then attempt to transfer the points to British Airways.

I logged in to my Iberia Plus account yesterday and tried to transfer the points, but it would only allow a transfer of 60,000 points and charged a fee of $50 so I called back to Iberia Plus and spent another hour with the representative explaining what had happened and what I was promised on the basis of the Iberia Rep's mistake.  The Rep told me there is nothing they can do. I asked to speak to a Supervisor and they said none was available, However they told me one would call me within the hour. My information was taken and I was told a Supervisor would call me back.  They never did.

I called again several hours later and was after a 30 min explanation I was transferred to a Supervisor and the line went dead (on purpose).  I called right back and had to spend another 30 min with the Rep explaining the situation. They finally transferred me to a supervisor and again the line went dead again (on purpose). I  called back a 3rd time and did the same 30 min explanation.  They said it was two hours to speak to a supervisor - I told them what had happened and they I would just stay on the line until one picked up.  After realizing I was not going to hang up, he spoke with a supervisor (the cowards would not get on the line) and they transferred all of my points.

I have a saying regarding Airlines.  If you put down the tray table and its not clean you wonder if they are servicing the engine.  If their customer service is representative of the way they manage their Airline - I have serious doubt about their safety.

I travel four or five times a year for different purposes, Asia, Europe, North and South America included. My experience with Iberia has been one of the worst in my life as a regular traveler and here are some of the reasons:
-my flight on July 24th., was suddenly cancelled, passengers have passed immigration and security in Madrid airport, we were already onboard when all of a sudden we were asked to disembark due to some “technical problems”, that’s all we were told. After disembarking no one from the airline gave further details or reasons. When passengers asked, Iberia staff seemed very annoyed and just said that we will be arranged into the next available flight. Before boarding the new flight, after a wait of around two hours, it was announced that the aircraft had some problems (a joke) too and we were offered a hotel with no compensation for being cancelled twice.
-on my flight bounded for Madrid from Santiago de Chile, on August 15th., the cabin crew was so unpleasant and unprofessional that when several passengers complained about the foul smell of the lavatories and the lack of hygiene, they answered very rudely and their attitude towards us, the customers, was very bad. The cabin had trash everywhere, the smell of the toilets came up to the seats we were assigned to so we were unable to rest for the whole trip.

The dispute came back denied because Iberia claimed that ""the flights were not cancelled"".  So they lied to keep the money.

We both had to walk up to the curtain, open it, and knock more than 6 times to ask for water, as did many other passengers.  All the crew did was give us one small cup, 3/4 of the way filled with water.  You would think that would be a sign that people are in need of water.  A couple of flight attendants did come down the aisles but they were JAUNING so we couldn't even catch their attention, nevermind put our waving hands back quick enough to not get hit by them.  I'm assuming they were rushing towards the front of the plane where first class was.  They never even looked at the passengers any time they came rushing out.  Also... space was so limited that it was extremely uncomfortable.  I did not see a single person in my area who did not need to get up multiple times to stretch.  Every time I went to use the bathroom I wished I could have just sat in there the entire flight because it would have been far more comfortable.  And you know how tiny those bathrooms are!  Finally, on one of my water trips I mentioned to the crew that another passenger had their window shade open at 1AM and the sun was directly in my eyes and in the eyes of an entire row of passengers.  One flight attendant waited about 7 minutes to come out and then quickly walked past the passenger and didn't even look at him.  The window remained open for the rest of the flight. I was confused and angry because on the flight to Barcelona the crew had made every single passenger close their window when it was night time so that people could sleep.

Do not fly Iberia!!,Boston,Madrid,International,"I went to Madrid for my birthday. I’ve been planning this trip with my best friend for months. My flight there was not bad at all. Other than the plane looking a little dated it was fine. My friend was flying in a couple days later. She had messaged me saying that she was not able to make her flight because the airline did not allow digital boarding passes, so she couldn’t get past tsa because of this. There was literally no one at the counter to help her, no kiosk, nothing! When she called for help to the airline they basically told tough luck and there was nothing they could do to help. I made the best of my trip that could given the situation. On my way back I had to catch a connection flight to Barcelona to Boston, no big deal, so I thought… The ticket that was printed out for me had me going to terminal “H” but no gate number. Thought that was strange so I asked for help. They directed me to go to terminal “M”. So I hope on the little train and go to M. But still no gate number. I’m not freaking out because boarding has started. I ask again for help and they told me no it’s in terminal “J”. At this point I’m almost in tears running around. I look at the boarding it to look for the 4th time to see it’s at terminal M gate 28. I barley make my flight. Thinking the worst is over. Definitely was wrong. Finally back in Boston waiting for my luggage, standing for over an hour waiting with everyone that was on the flight with me. My luggage never came. And basically anyone who was making a connecting flight didn’t get their luggage. It’s almost midnight, I’m exhausted and just want to go home. I file my claim for my luggage, and go home. I called repeatedly the following day. I finally get ahold of someone, they tell me it will be at the airport by 10pm Tuesday night. I get and email today (Wednesday) and a verbal confirmation that it’s at Boston Logan. Drive an hour in traffic only to be told it’s not there. I am fuming at this point!

The worst experience ever- read in full,Malaga,Nice,Europe,"The worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline in my life. We booked our flights 2 weeks before and checked in that morning. When we arrived at the airport in the afternoon we were told that they had oversold our flights and that our tickets were on standby. We were told to put our bags on the plane and go and wait by our gate. After waiting for 3 and a half hours (the plane was of course delayed by an hour) we were told that we could not get on the flight and that we would have to go to the lost and found and wait for our bags. Again, we were greeted by a very unhelpful Iberia employee who told us to wait until we say them. Another hour. We were then instructed to go to the customer service desk for a resolution. Well, it turns out Málaga airport doesn’t have a customer service
Desk for Iberia airlines. They do for almost every other airline but of course Spain’s national airline doesn’t have a customer service desk in a Spanish airport. We called the customer service line who then told us that we had to deal with it in the airport. So for fear of being stuck at the airport for 2 days, we have had to book an Air France flight to Paris. We have lost the first night at our hotel in the south of France, our Iberia tickets cost, we have to book a hotel In Paris for the night and they have basically ruined our vacation. Again, we were at the airport on time, we checked in on time, they just decided to sell more tickets than they had to maximize their profits with no regards for the customers. All the while being rude and not understanding. It’s no wonder Spain's economy is in such trouble given how their national airline does business .

The check-in and gate staff are third-party contractors. No one provided information about flight rescheduling, hotel stays or ground transport. Everyone from the flight had to go back through customs and then spend hours waiting for luggage to be released. We then had to line up at Level departure windows, again for hours, to find out what hotel we were allowed to sleep in. The only alternative flight home we were offered was an indirect flight THREE DAYS later. Despite spending hours on the phone confirming our family had seats on this flight, at checkin we were told our six-year-old did not have a ticket (despite having a ticket number). The best we could do was a flight from Barcelona to LA. After the 12 hour fight with two small children, we had to rent a car and make the 6 hour drive home from Los Angeles to San Francisco starting at 8 PM.

Filthy toilets of Iberia airline planes,Madrid,Caracas,International,"Disappointment with Iberia. 
I have done it again! I have traveled with Iberia airlines. Route Barcelona, Madrid/ Caracas and back Caracas/Madrid. What a horrific nightmare! Would I ever learn? But I swear this time,  never again!.  The story repeats… but you see the thing is Iberia does  offer good traveling schedules to Caracas. If you don’t want to fly direct to Caracas from Madrid  and arrive late in the evening, Iberia is your only choice. Plus let’s face it, Iberia  has been around for ages. And that is where I center my complaint or “review”. When you have been an airline of “larga trayectoria” (around for ages) and not always in the best of shape, you get complacent and perhaps also end up with old planes in your fleet. Now these old planes are perfectly functional. Some airlines even buy them to refurbish them like you would do to an old house and voilà, they are back in service as good as new. But it seems Iberia prefers to skip the extra cost of doing so and rather assign them to  routes where they know they have little competition. With the big players like Air France, Lufthansa, British Airways  and others gone out of the route Caracas/Madrid, Iberia is now king of these skies and, I suppose, it can afford to service this route with plain old planes.

Last June 29  on the scheduled flight Madrid/Caracas, carrying well over 100 passengers on the economic class,  3 hours on route and we are already with only 3 semi serviceable toilets in filthy state. The staff do warn you at the start of the flight not to wander into the business class toilets as a prelude for what they must know is coming. And no amount of complaining could persuade them to spruce them up, noticing that this is  “not their job”. Fair enough, these are already worn out toilets with stains and worn out seats, tape securing paper bins, lacking proper toilet paper as Ibearia prefers to offer kitchen towels for all your toilet necessities. I don’t blame the cabin staff really, they are only there to make the best of what Iberia has to offer. And please don’t get me started on the meals, not worth the paper to write on about it. My return to Madrid again on Iberia airline, was not different. Same story with the filthy old toilets and poor tasteless meals. On my return I decided to check if someone else has said anything or written any reviews. I also shared this experience with friends before deciding on writing a review myself. Regrettably, the general consensus is that the poor standards of Iberia airline spread across all their routes. I have not been on an Iberia flight for other international routes neither am I inclined to do so now. I have said at the beginning of this, I will not fly on Iberia again unless I hear they are willing to serve their clients on the South American routes with some dignified toilets and decent meals. I hope this time I keep my promise. 😝",June 2024,"July 21, 2024",1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0
Garbage. Genuinely surprised they haven’t collapsed.,London,Madrid,Europe,"Understaffed to the point they aren’t functioning. 1 person to check in a full flight Sat morning - took 3 hours & then they tried to stop security letting through to try to catch it because they just wanted it to take off and leave everyone stranded.. 

Flew out for work. Got there 4 hours before the flight but even then nearly missed the plane because of how unstaffed they are. 

I had 10 colleagues fly out on separate Iberia flights - 8 of whom didn’t get their luggage when arriving in Madrid. 3 still haven’t had it back and it’s been 2 days for them. (This has all happened within the space of 3 days) 

The website is useless when trying to local luggage. It doesn’t even tell you if your checked in luggage made it onto the plane! Turns out my luggage was left in UK… even though mine was checked in before a colleague I traveled with (who’s luggage arrived fine…)

The customer services phone person was useless & dismissive. What’s the point in having a dedicated lost luggage phone number if the person answering doesn’t have any access to a system to know if the luggage was put on the plane? And whose attitude is that they honestly couldn’t care less about your possessions going missing. 

Eventually we spent 3.5 hours in the Iberia customer service desk queue in Madrid airport. There were probably only 20 people ahead of us but again Iberia though it appropriate to only have 2 people on the desk (1 for business class & 1 for economy). By the time we got to the desk the queue was probably over 100 people. Only then did 2 more Iberia staff grace us with their presence. Although all they wanted to do was palm us off on a QR code online form (same thing they do at the desk but at the desk they can check what stay on the journey it’s at).

My husband is from USA and he is in the process to pick up his ID after 20 year of residence. This lady was very arrogant and unpolite during all the time I was trying to explain her why we bought his ticket as canary resident (we are canary resident). She did not accept my husband ticket, so I asked her to pay the difference, she told no, and she refuse to help me telling to move of in front of her because she needed to attend the other people. My son was in front asking all the time why the lady was talking to me so rude and unpolite...and why she called his dad illegal immigrant. Exactly she told, this is happening because you are an illegal immigrant. I went close to her to ask her why she told that, she put her face close to me and she told me get out off here or I am going to call the police.

Almost no information was shared with the passengers and what info we got, was vague.  (A passenger overheard an agent saying that the mechanics knew it would take at least four hours to fix the plane and by then we wouldn't have a pilot, but they didn't share that information with any of us.) At 19:30 after some confusion, all 400 of us were told we could go to customer service for a hotel.  (Some were sent away to find their own hotel while some were taken to a hotel an hour away.) After 23:00 my family finally got assigned a hotel and got a meal voucher for a hard dry sandwich, drink, kit-kat, and bag of potato chips (no other options and it had to be used that night). We spent five hours in the hotel before returning for our flight.  We were only half an hour late this time, but the plane did not even appear to have been cleaned as there was still trash lying around."" 

I submitted a request for compensation and received an email with a link to enter my bank information for the compensation deposit, but the link did not allow for US banking information.

Please Beware,Barcelona,Rome,Europe,"My wife and I flew Iberia for the first and last time. 

I will start with this, the staff on both of our flights (Barcelona to Madrid, Madrid to Rome) were kind and helpful. But there were massive issues with the airline on both flights. 

First is that both flights were very late, the first leg of our trip was about an hour late. Making it so we had to sprint from the first gate to the next to get to our layover flight. But that stuff happens from time to time. Not a huge deal, but people on the line for the second plane sat this happens quite often with them. So maybe it is a huge deal.

When we claimed compensation for the delay we were refused compensation, and told that the delay was due to 'external circumstances'.

The seats were dingy and the seat in front of me was missing the pocket. There was absolutely no entertainment on this flight. None of the seats had a screen so therefore there was nothing to do for 11-12 hours. The air didn’t seem to work properly, as it was hot throughout the entire flight. With about 2 hours left, I heard a woman tell the flight attendant that the bathroom was out of toilet paper. His response to her: “We don’t have any more available”!!! How does an airline run out of toilet paper???!! The flight attendants were nice to talk to, but really didn’t do much. They were in the back eating and talking. When people went back to ask for water they would point to a bottle and wouldn’t move to assist! 
The flight home was a bit better. We had entertainment this time around. However, one bathroom did not have working water and another was not working at all. The air conditioning system was not that great on this flight either.

Barely had time to ask for anything and when I did they said what do you want? I am a Spanish speaker and in any language that is a very impolite way to treat someone. As if they were doing me a favor !!! I paid for my flight. I wasn't flying for free !!! Got to Madrid on my way back from Tangier to Miami then Orlando. Asked THREE passport check airport employees for directions to my next flight. All THREE gave me incorrect directions and kept ignoring me when I stated I was going to miss my flight, also the fact that I only had 40 mins between flights did not help since when i booked it I was not made aware that time moves forward one hour when leaving Tangier, Those employees would not even look at my boarding pass and of course I missed my flight. I understand it was not Iberias fault but I was in an unfamiliar and extremely large airport, so was a bit lost. Went to the Iberia customer service counter and joined the long line of passengers who had also missed their flights. Needless to say I was treated with very little empathy and with very short and dismissive attitudes. I guess depending on what nationality you are you are treated differently. I noticed that because even though I am a  US citizen the people next to me, who were also US citizens, were treated with respect and understanding, not that anyone is above another in any way due to what your citizenship is, but I surely felt a bit discriminated.
 The unwillingness to help and the continuous blaming made me very angry. Was told I had to pay an additional $200 euros to get on the next flight. Which I refused to pay. I preferred to pay the VIP lounge at the airport and the train ticket back to Orlando. Iberia will never get 1 cent of my money ever again. Finally after lashing out and asking to speak to a supervisor, which was non existent, an employee agreed to put me on the next flight which was at 11:40 am the next day. No fee. I did end up paying 120$ to stay at the VIP lounge at the airport to get some rest, which was ok with me. Also ended up paying for a train ticket from Miami to Orlando because Iberia refused to issue me a ticket back to Orlando. All good though because at least after some arguing I was put on the next flight to Miami which  I did appreciate. I was better off on the train anyways.

Worst International Airline,Dallas,Madrid,International,"Do not waste your money flying Iberia. My son is on a Study Abroad trip right now in Spain and he landed in Spain on the 25th of June only to find out they left his bag back in Texas. As soon as he landed and his bag wasn’t at baggage claim, he tracked it back to the States. He went straight to their counter and they located it and said it would be put on the next flight and he would have it the next day. Next day rolled around and the next and he still didn’t have his bag. He called Iberia again and asked about his bag and let them know he would be flying to France for a couple of days and would pick it up when he flew back to Madrid. He got back and went to get his bag, they had sent it to Barcelona. 🤦🏻‍♀️ They said they would get his bag and have it sent to where he is currently studying and he would have it last weekend. It is now July 5th in the states and July 6th in Spain and he still doesn’t have his bag. 
He tried to file a reimbursement bag for everything he has had to replace while he has been waiting on his bag, and they said they would only reimburse him $20 out of the $1200 he’s had to spend on clothes, underwear, shoes, toiletries, chargers, etc. 
Keep in mind he’s a COLLEGE STUDENT who worked two jobs to pay for this trip. He bought clothes and everything he needed while in the states. Now he has had to buy more while he’s been over there and the airline won’t give him a straight answer and they haven’t gotten his bag to him when they said they would.

Believe the Reviews - A terrible airline,Los Angeles,Madrid,International,"A dreadful airline whose employees continuously demonstrate how much they hate their lives coupled with systems that are antiquated and inefficient. Customer service is reluctant at best at this airline. Iberia offered the only non-stop flight from California to Spain and that was our sole selection criteria. We bought tickets four months in advance, but as flight time approached, Iberia reached out to offer a $481 travel voucher to change our travel dates when they realized the flight was in demand and they could sell our tickets for more. I frustratingly entered travel document info (passport number, frequent flier, etc) over thirty times into their reservation system and the info never registered. It required a two-hour call with customer service (almost impossible to reach) to have to input the same info another six times before it 'stuck'. My reservation never reflected on Iberia’s App that made me nervous. I had to continually input the record locator from the reservation for Iberia to find my booking. The 'add booking' function doesn't work on their app. Check-in is a brave new world. Iberia's app informed that my flight was available for check-in however my ticket was deemed “not eligible” for app check-in so I'd need to go to the airport check-in desk. If you don't go to the airport to check-in the day before, Iberia will void and resell your seats and you will need to BUY NEW tickets. I was able to ultimately check-in with my laptop over a land line from a hotel. Fortunately, I was aware of the Iberia check-in scam from other reviews so I carried my laptop for my three-week vacation otherwise our tickets would have been vacated by Iberia. They hold your feet to the fire to comply with their protocols, yet their antiquated and unreliable systems are frequently unavailable so it becomes a game of Russian roulette to comply. Need to go to the Iberia check-in desk to get your boarding passes? Well you best check their hours of operation; Iberia doesn’t have an open check-in desk, and they arrive late and leave early.  Iberia’s app only permits you to check in, if they determine that your ticket is “eligible”.  (No clue what eligibility criteria might be).

- On Feb 16th 2024 we booked 5 tickets with a flex refund added 
 - On June 18th we called the contact center with a request to change the dates. In the same call the representative confirmed the tickets could be refunded, with a total charge of $125 and proceeded to create two cases.
- On june 21st we got an email requesting us to contact Iberia airline and when we called, the representative confirmed refund was approved and we need to wait 3 more days.
- On june 26th we received our boarding passes in email. Confused, we called the contact number and were told the refund was rejected as we opened the case within less than 15 days of the flight. They promised to look into the matter and  listen to the call recordings.
- On june 27th we received an email with a WRONG case number saying there is nothing we can do about your case due to lack of information.
- We called iIberia the same day and the contact center representative apologized and we requested to be contacted by a supervisor.

Specifically, I would like to highlight the following issues:
1. **Lack of Proper Training**: It is evident that the contact center team lacks the necessary training to handle refund cases efficiently.
2. **Misinformation**: The information provided to me by various representatives was often incorrect.
3. **Extended Resolution Times**: Each time I called, I was subjected to long wait times without any resolution.
4. **Lack of Clear Communication**: Throughout this process, I have not received any clear or consistent answers regarding the status of my refund. The communication has been poor, and my attempts to seek clarity have been met with vague responses.

so please, do yourself a favor and book your flights with some other airline.",June 2024,"June 28, 2024",1.0,,,,,,,,
Terrible Customer Service Experience with Iberia,Chicago,Madrid,International,"This was the worst customer service experience I've ever had.

I was absolutely sure there was some kind of mistake in the system since the BOOKING CONFIRMATION AND TICKETS WAS EMAILED TO ME AND MONEY PENDING IN MY BANK ACCOUNT, however when I spoke to a representative, she said the TICKETS ARE CANCELLED due to some b.s. reason (misinformation), REALLY???MISINFORMATION? You didn't see any misinformation while charging my card!!!!!  BASICALLY, THEY ARE A SCAM!!! TERRIBLE CUSTUMER SERVICE. The ""manager"" hung up on me after she couldn't come up with any convincing enough b.s. why THEY CHARGED MY CARD, EMAILED ME THE TICKETS then CANCELLD THE TICKETS, DIDN'T INFORM ME OF THE TICKETS BEENG CANCELED AND DIDN'T RETURN THE MONEY!    I am so happy I didn't show up at the airport AFTER THE SURGERY AND NOT BEING ABLE TO WALK just to find out these @holes cancelled my tickets and took my money.  I have no idea if I will get my money back. So far, they sent me a very shady looking receipts that I can create myself.

Nightmare Airlines - Pure European Laziness and Incompetence,New York City,Venice,International,"The worst airlines I’ve ever flown in my 26 years of being alive and flying. My flights were JFK > MAD > VCE, and I initially faced a delay at JFK, which overlapped with my layover and would make me miss my flight to VCE, even though my luggage was still tagged to go to VCE. They refused to change my connection at JFK, insisted I change at MAD. It took me four hours, calls, and online service, and I finally got the change, but apparently they canceled the luggage (even though they charged me double for only one piece, hah), and it got left behind at JFK. So I made it all the way to VCE and not a single person, online, on the phone, at the baggage help desk in MAD or VCE, knew where my luggage was. I was lucky that I’d packed my AirTag into it, otherwise I probably would never know where it went. Despite trying 20(!) times to file a PIR (missing luggage request), I got technical difficulty errors. So I tried to request the baggage service center at VCE to do it. No help again. I called 3 times and emailed 3 times to do it. I’ve been doing this for 2 days. Somehow the request wasn’t filed until a few hours ago, but when I’ve been tracking my luggage, it has gone from JFK to MAD to VCE. So somehow my luggage has made it to VCE without ever having an official request filed. These guys are beyond incompetent and though the luggage is here they still haven’t delivered it. It’s absurd how disorganized, disrespectful, and chaotic this airlines is. Please never fly Iberia.",May 2024,"June 25, 2024",1.0,,,,,,,,
"Worst Airline in the World, no exaggeration.",New York City,Madrid,International,"This is absolutely the worst airline possible. We were flying from JFK to Malaga with a layover in Madrid (the most god-awful airport possible). First, the amount of legroom and personal space in the plane is ridiculously small. I felt trapped in the small space. I am 6’ tall and the space seems to be geared toward people 5’4” or less. Ridiculously uncomfortable in comparison to every other airline. They had a good amount of entertainment options that utilized plug in, wired headphones. The sound was much louder in one eat than the other. In addition, the number of scarily screaming infants and children kept everyone awake on the overnight flight. And things got worse from there. 
The second plane was scheduled to depart at 7:15am after the first landed at 6:15am. After running through the airport afraid we would miss the flight, we were relieved to make it just in time at 7:12am. We were told the flight was already closed, leaving behind us (me, wife, son) and my son’s entire 50ish person band who traveled to Spain to perform. Now we are stranded in the Madrid airport with only standby tickets and our rental car was not held in Malaga because of the day-long delay. No one from the airline is sure where our checked luggage is. There are only 2 customer service employees at the counter and I waited in line twice for an hour to have questions answered unsuccessfully. Airline will not refund the tickets, especially inappropriate when my son and his group just left for a 5+ hour bus ride to make it to their destination in time to play a concert tomorrow. Will shortly rent a car and make the 5 hour trek myself after not sleeping for the past 30+ hours because I have no other choice.

Lots of scratches and marks on the chairs and walls. The drinks service had limited free items, all spirits/cocktails required extra payment to purchase. The food was disappointing, not presented well at all (I was given a lone burger patty with some potatoes next to it). This on its own was not too bad, but there were some additional annoyances that stood out. The seatbelt sign was left on for over four hours in a row near the end of the flight (with no turbulance experienced at all) and they would not offer any drinks at this time and often told people they should not be using the toilet. Additionally, the tempurature was kept lower than I believe I have ever experienced on a plane, multiple people were coughing and shivering during the second half of the flight.

I filed a declaration of lost luggage, my bag was untracked, there was no trace of where it was. I made 7 calls to customer support, they were unable to tell me where the bag was, whether it had stayed in Madrid, had arrived to Paris.

The carelessness, unprofessionalism, cumulated mistakes and absolute incompetence across the board is like no other I have ever experienced. As a frequent traveler it's happened to me before that a piece of luggage doesnt make it. But this was just next level.

Iberia Airlines: Frustrating and Stressful Experience with Flight Change,Santiago,Madrid,International,"# Review for Iberia Airlines

I recently had a deeply frustrating experience with Iberia Airlines regarding a change to my return flight reservation. Originally, my flight was scheduled to return from Rome to Santiago via Madrid. I attempted to change the origin of my return flight to Milan instead of Rome but faced significant difficulties on the company's website, which redirected me to a phone operator.

After spending several minutes on the phone, I was informed that I could change the origin of my return flight for an additional cost of approximately $500 per passenger. I accepted the charge for myself and my two children, assuming the matter was resolved. However, upon arrival at the airport, I was shocked to be told that I could not board the flight, though my children could. This situation was absurd and highly stressful.

At the check-in counter, I was instructed to call customer service because the staff at the counter could not assist me, causing further delays and frustration as other passengers waited to check in. During the phone call, I was informed that I needed to pay extra to secure my place on the flight from Milan, despite having already paid for the change. This made no sense, especially since my children and I were on the same reservation.

After an hour on the phone, I was finally offered a seat on the flight, but my return flight issue remained unresolved. As the departure time approached, I feared missing the flight altogether. Although I eventually boarded, I spent the entire journey anxious about not having a confirmed return flight.

From Spain, I had to make multiple calls to ensure that my return flight was confirmed. Despite assurances over the phone, I only received the tickets and reservation confirmation for my youngest child, not for myself or my older child. The stress and unpleasantness of this situation were overwhelming, especially when traveling with two young children.

I strongly urge Iberia to revise their policies to empower check-in counter staff to resolve such issues. Up until now, I was a satisfied customer who recommended Iberia to friends and family. However, after this experience, I will seriously reconsider flying with them again. I specifically chose a flexible flight option, which did not prove to be flexible in this case.

This experience was deeply disappointing and stressful. Iberia, please take note and improve your customer service and policies to prevent others from going through similar ordeals.",May 2024,"June 9, 2024",1.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0

"Iberia an unsafe, reckless airline, and a big scam",Barcelona,Miami,International,"This was the worst experience I’ve had on my life. I believe it is a scam to make reservations for an Iberia flight and ending on a plane from something called Level, this plane was an unmarked, old white plane. My seat was broken, when I complaint about the condition of the plane and how unsafe I felt and that I wanted to get out the entire crew tried to convince me to stay so I did, I felt I had no option, they ensured that the seat was the only issue and I should not base my feeling with a seat, that the rest of the plane was safe. Well as soon as they closed the cabin this happened: NO TV ON THE ENTIRE PLANE, NO WIFI, RUSTY FLAPS, AND BATHROOM IN TERRIBLE CONDITION, NO AC, NO AIR CIRCULATION, all this on a 9 hours flight, I experience an anxiety attack for the entire flight with nothing to calm me down, the plane made so much noises, that I felt at some point it will crash. So I paid a 1500$ ticket to travel in this condition? So my advise is please don’t use this airline because you might end up in a unmarked, old plane like this and your safety, your peace of mind is more valuable.

I booked our fully refundable fights from LAX to BCN 9 months in advance.  Exactly 3 weeks prior to our trip, Iberia cancelled our flight and rebooked on us on a flight 2 days earlier.  Unfortunately we could not leave work 2 days sooner so we were left to find a different option.  With it being so close to our departure time, our options were limited and much more expensive.  I called Iberia and let them know the new flight would not work for us and requested a refund.  I was told the refund was processed and I would see the credit to my card within 15 days. 
When we left on our trip 21 days later, we still had not gotten the refund, but I didn't have time to call and deal with it until we got home.  At that point, the refund was a month late.
I was told the original Iberia agent who processed our refund had done it incorrectly, but the current agent would rectify that and we'd receive a refund within 7 days.

Pay more to avoid flying Iberia - it'll save you a panic attack at the airport,Madrid,Boston,International,"I've traveled all over the world and on countless airlines, including to third world countries. I have never had such a horrible, inhuman experience as with flying with this airline. Please avoid at all cost or travel at your own peril and cost of your mental health. I am an avid Spain lover, especially of their people. I travel there at least once a year. I've mainly taken American or British. That's why going through the nightmare at the Madrid airline still scars me. The last time I took Iberia was something of a surreal, slow motion movie script that's impossible to believe.

My two minor children and I arrived at the Madrid airport and got into a check in line that stretched into eternity. At first it was steadily moving, as there were 3 attendants checking people in. Shortly, one attendant got up and left, leaving one attendant to attend to first and business class and the other all the rest. The line started moving significantly slower. After about 30 min, the second attendant gets up and leaves, leaving one attendant to check in about 30 more passengers. At this point we were moving at a snail's pace, and the boarding time starting to approach by the minute. There were still about 15 people in front of us and most with children and multiple bags to check in. All of a sudden, the last remaining attendant gets up, grabs her purse and starts to walk away. We are all in shock, running after her, explaining that we have to board and there is still a 30 min estimate time to get though security and switch terminals via a rail. She simply says, ""I got a call, I am needed elsewhere."" She then walks away, leaving us stranded, at a loss, freaking out, as we are all about to miss our flights. Luckily a passenger began to frantically run around the airport calling for help. One random attendant came over to help us all with ticketing and baggage, but we all had to run to get to our flights and we barely made it. When we got into the plane I broke down in tears. This level of sheer insanity should never happen in a civilized society. My poor daughters were traumatized and shaken.

It's still hard to process especially because I had a couple other negative experiences with this company but I tried not to overreact. This time is enough for me to never ever fly this company again. I would rather pay extra than deal with their nightmares. They are rude, have ZERO customer service ability, like, who trains them?

WORST AIRLINE EVER. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!,Palma de Mallorca,London,Europe,"APPALING SERVICE!! Absolutely shocking airline. Worst experience ever.  First time booking with Iberia. The flight is run by British Airways but booking done through Iberia.
We arrived at Heathrow Airport on 22nd May to go on holiday with two toddlers. Had booked direct flights only to find out we were kicked off the flight and were not able to board the flight we paid for!! Iberia then arranged another flight for us where we had to change in Brussels for 3 hours which meant arriving 7 hours later than planned. Resulting in a horrible journey with two toddlers. However, this is not the worst thing about the airline....
A day before our flight back which was already booked through Ibera, we try to check in online only to find out we have also been removed from our flights back and Iberia had not even informed us about this. We only found out as we couldn't check in online and so called the airline to enquire. 

I have been travelling several times a year for the last 20 years and have never ever experienced a situation where I am removed from a flight I paid thousands of pounds for without even being informed about it!!

Iberia could not even help us and recommended we book flights back home through a different airline!! We ended up paying another £2000 to travel back from palma to London. Standardly this ticket would only cost a few hundred pounds, but as we had to book less than 24 hours before the flight, we ended up paying a lot of money. 

When we requested to speak to a manager whilst trying to resolve the issue with Iberia over the phone, we were told to call back in 7 hours as we do not speak Spanish and therefore had to wait for the English speaking manager to start his shift.",May 2024,"May 31, 2024",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Brainless cabin crew,Copenhagen,Madrid,Europe,"I filed a complained in their website, but was a bit tricky to find the right path so not sure it will go through. The complaint was regarding the treatment I received from the cabin crew on flight IB3729 on April 3rd, 2024.
My seat was 9C, I had been sick prior to the flight (not really relevant but so you understand how ridiculous the woman behaved), and had fallen asleep for a while. When I woke up I was in REAL need of the bathroom, since I was in 9C I went to the front one. The door was open, meaning that nobody was using it, am approaching it and this cabin crew person stood in front of me telling me that the bathroom is only for business class. I told her that I had never heard such a thing in this small plane (I've been travelling for 33 years...), besides no one was using it so why can't I?
She just stood there saying I need to go all the way back to the economy class bathrooms, I was in shock, I was right there in front of COMPLETELY EMPTY BATHROOM, the door was even half open she could see no one was there! And told her I had jus woken up, had been sick, please let me use the bathroom, it's urgent. I used the word urgent and she just stood there, being completely rude.
I've gone through ALL Iberia's website, read ""our seats"", ""terms and conditions of economy fare"", all the ""Iberia Experience"" tab and IT IS NOT STATED ANYWHERE THAT THE FRONT BATHROOM IS ONLY MEANT TO BE USED BY ECONOMY CLASS IN SHORT FLIGHTS.
I almost do on my pants in front of her, honestly my use of the bathroom would've taken less time than the whole conversation I had with her. Am at awe to believe that Iberia trains their cabin crew to be such brainless people.",April 2024,"May 13, 2024",1.0,,,,1.0,,,,
Random selection -racism,Madrid,Boston,International,"This is the worst experience. Just when I traveled to the gate. They told me that I was selected for “random inspection”. I asked the crew members what is “random inspection”, they could not tell me what is the reason. Then I was waiting for a very long time and the person who were supposed to provide the inspection did not seem to know why I was there for. Once after the long wait, they asked me if I had liquid in my backpack. Of course I purchased water bottle inside after the security check. Then the inspector just open my bag and superficially peeked inside. I was the only non white person for this flight. Very awful experience.

AVOID this Airline at ALL Costs! Absolutely HORRIFICE Airline!,Chicago,Madrid,International,"Believe ALL the reviews.

They really think they can get a luggage transfer with only 35 minutes? Our luggage was misplaced for the first 5 days of our vacation. Totally ruined our trip. Wife a massive stress case. Spent multiple calls with them on the phone every day until they finally figured out how to get us our luggage. We also lost a connecting flight while dealing with their customer service in the Madrid airport so had to re purchase that flight. Now to the flight itself. HORRIBLE plane. The crew were rude and disrespectful. They made it a habit of intentionally smacking my elbow every time they brought the cart by. You could even see them smirking about it. The bathrooms and plane in general were FILTHY. The plane looked like it had not been maintained. If there are any other ways for you to get to Spain, I would use someone else.

From a crowd of people becoming extremely hostile due to prior paid accommodations being changed, which should be unacceptable to being stuck on our plane 3 hours without being told what is happening. The flight attendants don’t seem like they want to work, even telling angered customers it’s not their problem. Not only do I suffer from anxiety and time my flight times very precisely, I understand delays and what that can look like but leaving over 400 passengers without any clue for over 3 hours is unacceptable.

Oneworld Sapphire status confers no extra checked bag benefit with Iberia,New York City,Madrid,International,"My wife and I recently flew from JFK to Madrid on Iberia. We had two cabin bags and two checked suitcases. None of the bags exceeded weight or size restrictions. We were told we could check the cabin bags for no charge. We were then told that I would have to pay for my one suitcase due to an error in their system that they couldn't correct at the airport. I was told I would have to call Iberia and request a refund. My multiple calls to Iberia eventually led me to where I could make an online refund claim. That claim was denied with no explanation except to indicate the charge was correct. The ticket we purchased was economy class, which normally entitles you to one checked bag on international flights. Additionally, my wife had oneworld sapphire status, which should entitled her to two checked bags. Iberia has not responded to my request to review the matter further in over a week.

If you absolutely have to travel Iberia, re-evaluate your life's choices.. but if you are going to go anyway, ensure you either book with them directly or validate your booking on their website, choose you seats on their website, etc. And don't fall for any BS answer they give you about booking outside of them directly.. they have a contract with these booking agencies to sell in their marketplace; if there's a problem, it's not only their fault, but something THEY NEED TO FIX with the agency, you are not at fault for using their marketplace that they contract for",April 2024,"April 26, 2024",2.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,5.0

I experienced sudden price increases in the middle of customizing my flight itinerary. Such practices are highly unprofessional and unacceptable in the realm of customer service.

As a customer, I expect transparency and consistency throughout the booking process. However, the sudden changes in prices not only disrupt the booking experience but also erode trust in your brand.

We have never been on such an uncomfortable flight or as tightly packed as this plane was!!
We were unable to drop our tray tables down for our food due to the tiny space between us and the seats in front. When our main meal came we told the steward of this problem he just took our food away and said ""Have a nice day""!!
We went twelve hours without anything to eat, although the people around us said that the food was not fit to eat any way!!
When we booked this flight all our friends said to us that we had made a mistake because we had booked with ""Spanish Ryanair""!! We thought they were wrong in this statement as its an insult to Ryanair, for a national carrier it is utterly disgusting.

Multiple canceled flights and terrible customer support,San Diego,Barcelona,International,"We booked flights in October for a honeymoon in April. Over that period of time our flights were changed 10+ times and canceled completely twice. After they were canceled the first time, the agent rebooked us for the same flight saying there was a mistake in the system. After they were canceled the second time, the agent rebooked and sent a confirmation number for Iberia that in their online system was connected to the wrong American Airlines flight. They deleted our seat choices and checked baggage upgrades without refunding us, and when we tried to choose our new seats they had a charge of $200+ to sit together because the new flight had no seats together. We sat on the phone for in total probably 15+ hours over weeks trying to fix these issues every time they canceled the new flights. We were not allowed the talk to a manager without jumping through a million hoops even though in 1 day we had to call 5 times, and only the manager could actually fix anything. We’re now a week away from our flight and they still have not fixed the issue with American Airlines so we might not have meals or seats together on our freaking honeymoon. We might not even have a flight given the online portal links to the incorrect flights on American. This is hands down THE WORST experience I have ever had with an airline. And for our HONEYMOON. I will NEVER, all caps bolder letters, NEVER fly Iberia EVER AGAIN. And if anyone out there wants to take them to court class action for canceling our flights and our upgrades and then recharging for upgrades that THEY CANCELLED I will happily stand witness with documentation and hopefully get compensated for the upgrades I had to pay for twice and the insane amount of time spent fixing things they broke in the first place.",April 2024,"April 8, 2024",1.0,,,,,,,,

Lost my bag,London,Madrid,Europe,"Picked up a flight in London to Madrid.  As we missed our flight connection. Went to Iberia office for baggage confirmation instead of lying for an hour while they organized our bags. Upon arrival my son's bag was misplaced. Stood in line for another hour and a half to see if they could locate the bag. We could not locate our bag and told us they would work on locating the bag and send it to our location outside Madrid. I contacted the lost bag operator immediately after speaking with me Agent. I explained to him that my son is in Spain for 9 days for a soccer tournament and all his equipment is in the bag. He explained to me to buy whatever I needed and submit the receipt. I bought him a change of clothes, soccer cleats, shin pads underwear , toiletries and a jacket. The bag finally arrives 3 or 4 days later. I submitted all my receipts and after their review they reimburse me $52. I emailed  them back explaining that I don't think it's a fair amount but they did not reply and to date haven't received payment. Even a higher portion not even 100% I would have been okay with. $52 basically covers for the trees and maybe a couple packs of underwear. I find this to be ridiculous today who can survive for 4 days playing soccer and practices everyday without a change of clothes or underwear. If you know anything about Spanish soccer if you don't have shin pad socks or sleeves they will not let you play which means we would have missed four days of soccer after paying $10,000 to have him at this tournament. Some people might say what he can borrow someone's shoes and gym pads but unfortunately my son's feet are quite large for his age he has adult size feet for a 12 year old Size 10 and 1/2 which means he had no shoes to share with anybody.",March 2024,"April 7, 2024",1.0,3.0,3.0,,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0

Do not fly Iberia!,Düsseldorf,San Juan,International,"I never write reviews, but my experience with this company has made me do it. 

I have decided to book my flight with Iberia as it was the most direct and thought the most convenient, I spent around 500 euros more for this benefit, however I did not enjoy it. First of all, I have paid for seat selection which NOWHERE during checkin was available. 
On my return flight, I was refused boarding during my connection because i didnt make it in time to the flight, while i was refused on boarding, while check in was still open, i was told I missed it... insane!

Furthermore when i complaint and requested compensation (as per EU laws) I was told I am not entitled to any compensation in a lack of empathy and respect tone.

Very Bad experience,San Juan,Lisbon,International,"On December 4 2023, I booked a flight for March 2024, for my husband and I. It was from San Juan, PR to Lisbon returning from Santiago de Compostela on April 2. both legs  with a lay over at Barajas. I bought the same tickets I usually buy, selecting the seats in the front row. For the first leg, San Juan to Lisbon, there was only one hour to change flights at Barajas. I called, not once but twice to Iberia expressing my concern with the short time to change flights. On both occasions I was assure  that we will have time, because we didnt have to collect bags or pass immigration. (This last statement was wrong, we did have to pass immigration at Barajas.)

I was not able to make the on line check in and  when I called Iberia to address this subject, I was told they were making a maintenance to the  web page and to try later. I check with them that my seats were set but I was  told I only had selected seats for the returning flight!
I tried several times to make on line check in and was unable to. We had to arrive very early to the airport to do the check in and get the seats selected by Iberia. The flight was overbooked! Thanks God we arrived early! 
When we arrived at Barajas we did have to pass immigration, There was absolutely  not enough time to make the connection, not even our bags were able to make it.  We had to wait almost 8 hrs on the airport for the next plane to Lisbon. 
For the returning flights we were not able ether to make the online checkin and it turns out we didnt have selected seats either! 
Until recently, there use to be only three flights per week from San Juan, PR to Madrid with Iberia and everything ran smoothly, I never had any problem. Now they have more flights (I believe one daily) and I am under the impression that they are not prepare to handle the increased volume of passengers; the web page couldn't handle it: the booking was wrong and I didnt  have access to manage my booking and make the online check in. The call center that manages passengers concerns was not knowledgable and the instructions given were not accurate, causing us to lose the connecting flight with a delay of almost eight hours for the next flight.

The food in question was not a ""meal"" and therefore I was not given the option to select any accommodation when booking.

In all other food services where meat was served the type of meat was communicated, as was a vegetarian option.

It is incumbent on the food service provider to communicate the contents of the food, not the passenger. Failure to do so is irresponsible and puts passengers at risk.

I bought tickets via their website at the end of the month of February. Spent over $7000. I have no tickets and the amount was debited. was told that the system did not generate the tickets I bought. They apparently issued a refund without my knowledge. Called multiple times.I haven't received it yet. Customer service is a joke. They refuse to escalate the call to a supervisor. I was told to wait 24 to 72hrs for the problem to be fixed. It went from that to 5 to 7 days . Today the man on the phone told me "" well you have to wait 15 days"". hum no I wasn't told that. prices have gone up.

Disinterested and uncomfortable airline - avoid,Granada,London,Europe,"We'd booked from Granada to London via Madrid. Connection time was tight - 1 hour - but the airline proposed the schedule. Bit worried at Granada when the seat issued for the Madrid-London leg was not the one paid for. Flight late leaving Granada and arrived at the most distant gate at T4. We then had to get to T4S in less than 40m. Mad rush through the terminal, endless retail obstructions, poor signage, got hot, sweaty, down to the crowded transit train, then rush up the other side to find the queue of queues for border control. By the time we'd got through that and rushed to the gate the flight had closed. Then had to queue again to get rebooked on a later flight. The booked months in advance emergency exit seat was gone of course and we had to sit in one of the most cramped seats ever. I have a knee prothesis and the knee was jammed up against the seat in front - two hours of agony. Throughout the Iberia staff were rude and unhelpful, with the shining exception of the connection desk clerk who was really good. The points that come to mind are:
1) If they can't be sure of the connection time, don't let customers book it.
2) Respect the seats booked - and paid for.
3) You know if the connection can be made before the origin flight leaves. Why not do the rebooking at the origin and save all the passenger pain later?
4) With tight connections other airlines I have flown with in the past have had a car waiting at the gate to run such passengers to the connecting aircraft gate.

We were not the only ones with connection problems; the Malaga flight was also affected, there must have been 10-12 of us. Clearly Iberia knew about the problem but did absolutely noting to mitigate it. What a shower. We will be avoiding Iberia in future and definitely avoiding Madrid for any connections - they might be upgrading it but clearly they have learnt nothing from decent airports like Changi and Dubai. And if you are tall or long legged the seat pitch is crippling - even Ryanair had more room. We couldn't even see the inflight safety briefing on the A320 as the crew member was so far down the aircraft.

Very bad after sale service.,Lima,Brussels,International,"""I am appalled by the dishonesty, incompetence, and deception I have encountered with Iberia. I have spent the last 7 hours attempting to change my flight, which I purchased with the option to alter my return date. However, Iberia has made this process unnecessarily complicated. Online changes are unavailable, and their announced option to use WhatsApp for assistance is non-functional. Additionally, tariffs have inexplicably been unavailable on the website since yesterday, forcing me to rely on phone service for information and changes. However, each time I call, I am placed on hold and the call eventually disconnects. I have spent a total of 6 hours on the phone with 9 different representatives. The first representative informed me of a 700 euro difference in tariffs from what I originally paid, after 40 minutes of waiting. When I requested to speak to the responsible person, I was told it was impossible. Subsequent calls revealed discrepancies in tariff amounts, ranging from 17 euros to 600 euros due to alleged tariff changes every 15 minutes. Only one representative offered a solution for the call failures, promising a callback that never materialized. After hours of frustration, I finally spoke to someone who quoted a 214 euro difference, though this amount had previously been much lower. I am still on the phone, waiting to make payment, and constantly being told to wait another 15 minutes. This level of service is completely unacceptable.""

At check in they blatantly disregarded my request to tag my electric scooter for gait check at the plane door.  They said to get the tag from the gait agent. The gait agent said, ""we don't do that"", "" go back to the check in agent.""  They would not listen to reason. Then they called the airport police and asked me to prove that the scooter was mine and not stolen. Their reasoning was, that if it had not been tagged at check in, then I must have stolen it. I explained to deaf ears, that THEY  had to issue the tag and refused. We showed them multiple pictures of me on the scooter from previous travels around the world. One gait agent told me that I was ""stupid"".

Kicked Out of Business Class / Bullied into Economy / NO GUARANTEE OF REFUND / MISSED FLIGHT,Dallas,Malaga,International,"It was a nice day at DFW airport and I am packed and ready for my spring break trip with friends and family to Malaga, Spain. I booked a separate flight from my friends. I arrived at Terminal D 2.5 hours before my flight, went to check-in and the gate agent said, ""Are you traveling standby?"" I quickly informed him that I have a paid ticket for business class that I purchased in September 2023 through Ovago. I showed him the booking. He sends me down to a lady named Maria at the check in desk. Maria pressed buttons for 3 hours, and told me Iberia oversold the flight, but there are 3 seats in business with a ""R"" meaning reserved. She said she could not put me in those seats. I asked why, she said they were purchased seats. 

At this point I have been standing with Maria for 1 hour and I am getting pretty upset, you have 3 seats, I am here to check in, but they wont give me my seat. Instead, I am scolded for not checking in ""online"". I tried, but the Iberia system did not work, came up and said ""system error"". 

At this point I am confident I will still get on my flight. So I called Iberia customer service, the agent on the phone kept telling me she could not help from afar, she did not have that reach. She can not see the seating chart, the gate agent is the only one that can get me on the flight. After 38 minutes of talking with Iberia I put Maria, my gate agent, on the phone with Iberia directly, after 20 minutes of talking with Maria, the Iberian representative hangs up on Maria. Maria hands my phone back to me, and rolls her eyes. 

My flight boards at 9:20, it takes off at 10:05. It is now around 9:40 and Maria tells me, I have your ticket for premium economy, you can take it if you want it, otherwise you will not be flying, and I am leaving.  My question from the beginning was, ""how much money will I get back on my ticket if I take this downgrade and board the plane?"" Iberia rep on the phone, nor Maria could tell me if I would get anything in return. I have paid almost 5K for a business ticket, there is nothing wrong with my ticket per Iberia Customer Service, yet I do not have a seat because Iberia oversold their flight. Iberia will not admit to their fault. I was advised by Ovago that if I board the flight I would not get a refund, so I opted to walk away and miss the flight, assuming I would get another flight or refund at the worst.

One would assume they would offer a different flight on a different day, which is still really bad, but at least an option. Maria looked, no business class tickets available for the next 3 days on any flights to Malaga. She kept wanting me to take economy seats but would give me no confirmation of what refund I would get in return. Iberia would not put me in a hotel. Iberia ultimately made an error and would not own up and handle their business. 

I am very very angry and sad I missed my trip with family and friends who are waiting for me in Malaga right now. The tickets for next day flights have increased 50-60% from September 2023 when I booked. It is amazing that big corporations get away with treating customers like this. I still do not know if I will get anything in refund, the airline said I was a ""no show"" customer since I would not get bullied into a downgraded seat.

Missing and raided luggage in Iberia,Guatemala City,Frankfurt,International,"After arriving to Frankfurt, none of our 4 pieces of luggage arrived with us. Nobody from the airline was in the airport to assist us. In the claim luggage area they gave us a paper form which needed to be filled  by hand and return to an agent of TSW ( I understand is the local handler). They said they where to put this info in the system and I was suposed to receive an email later that night. I am  Still waiting! 
We where very uneasy with the situation and my wife decided to go to the airport at 7 am. Talking to various people  she managed to locate one of my missing bags (which by the way wasn’t reported to me yet).
Later in the morning we received an email stating  that her luggage was to arrive in the 11 ok flight from Madrid.  We rushed back to the airport and to our surprise my wife’s luggage lock was broken and the suit case open.  My wife is very organized and packs with great care she packs in cloth bags and such, the suit case was all messed up inside and found that the 3 pairs of Chanel shoes , one cashmere/mink poncho a Gucci belt and some other fine clothes where missing. This people must have seen through the x ray machine the metal buckles of shoes and belt and decide to raid the suitcase. Don’t know either if the luggage was left in Madrid  on purpose?? The Suit case lock  was broken making the suitcase no longer usable.we estimate  more than$ 8kin value where lost. We are still missing one bag! 
The lady’s in the counter where really nice and helpful but with no authority on the matter and  unable to help other than recomending to call the airline. 
 There is no one to talk to from the airline. I really hope that Iberia covers the damage as the luggage was under their care the hole time.
My wife si an executive platinum emerald member in American airline one world program. We where traveling in business class and our luggage tagged as priority? 
I don’t understand what that means anymore. 
Shame on Iberia and its customer service, I would not recommend any body checking luggage with them and never to leave garments that can be identified  in the x ray machine. Iberia it’s  a one world alliance member and one would expect better customer service.

Failed Return trip with Service Dog,Malaga,Chicago,International,"I made the mistake of booking through American Airlines, and that seems to be where much of the difficulties I am experiencing start from. I was able to get a ticket and board the flight from ORD to MAD. Although I had to explain my ADA service dog status to the airline. 

In MAD, I had to exit the airport after stopping twice at Iberia service desks asking for the ticket for my next connecting flight, as they would only give me a ticket at ORD for the first flight. There are no service dog relief areas in Spain’s airports, so I had to eventually go outside for my dog.  I eventually ended up re-entering the airport and running between Iberia snd American desks because neither seemed to be coordinating information-I couldn’t get a ticket on the correct flight, nor get my checked bag on the flight I was ticketed standby on nothing.  Once past security, I found an Iberia help desk and was given a ticket on a flight.  

After we boarded, we deplaned because of a problem with the plane.  We by a stroke of luck left on another plane from a different gate about an hour late. 

This brings me to my return trip from. AGP-MAD-ORD.  I confirmed my service dog with American. American changed my departure date to a day earlier, as I would have 50 minutes between landing and my next flight departing, which is impossible to do.  So I booked a room in Madrid.  

When I arrived 3 hrs early, I stood in line until 1.5 hrs before the flight left to get my first ticket.  Then, I was told that Iberi a would not give me a ticket because there was no record of a service animal.  I pointed out that I travelled to Spain without a problem. I produced the Iberia form and American information showing I had gone through the process to bring the dog, but 3 agents said no.  If the dog isn’t on my reservation. I could not go.  They wrote a phone number for Iberia Reservations on a baggage tag and told me to call them. They also made clear that I could not fly without giving at least 49 hours notice of my service animal. (Side note, for the trip home, I had secured a EU Pet Passport noting my service animal.)

Iberia’s reservation line told me the error was on American’s part, as they had no record of a service dog on my trip at all.  I again pointed out that I traveled to Spain on the same reservation without a problem.  They refused to do anything to assist me, so I called American.  They also informed me of needing to notify them 48 hours minimum in advance of a flight that I’d be traveling with a service animal, which I told them I did the same day or day after I booked the trip months ago. 

After spending 11:30am-7:30pm on the phone with both airlines, the best solution American could provide (because I eria can’t get their computer system to add a service animal in their reservation or ticketing system) was to forward me all of the emails between the two airlines confirming my service dog on all of the flights I had either been on been ticketed on.  

So, I am left in Malaga for 2 more days to hope that by some miracle I get tickets at both airports and travel home with my service dog if the agents at the airport decide to accept the emails as proof that I should indeed be allowed to fly home with my animal.  Honestly, I don’t have high hopes of returning home as American and Iberia Special  Assistance departments promised me tonight.  

I never would have dreamed getting home would be such a challenge.  I mean, I have documentation from vets in the US and Spain , USDA certification, ADA certification, original rabies documentation, and  the Iberia and American Service dog forms/documentation.

She asked where I was and I said I ran to the toilet as we had been waiting already 5 minutes and I did not know how much longer we would have to wait so I thought it was the best decision. She said I was lying and not saying the truth, that we were not waiting 5 minutes. We were definitely waiting 5 minutes and it is not something she should start arguing with clients over. She accused me of not telling the truth several times and calling me a liar lol, when I kept telling her we did indeed wait for 5 minutes.

Cheap tricks to get money,Porto,Buenos Aires,International,"I found the flight to be acceptable, though not the best. However, I must express my dissatisfaction with the purchasing process, which I find to be one of the most peculiar and unprofessional practices I've encountered from an airline company.

As someone who frequently purchases flight tickets, I have never experienced a system where direct purchase is not an option. Instead, this airline reserves the ticket and deducts €10 from your account, only refunding it if you choose not to proceed with the purchase. If I intended to make a reservation, I would have done so directly without this unnecessary step. I voiced my concerns, yet they refused to refund my money. If €10 is crucial to you, then by all means, keep it. However, I have decided I will not fly with this airline again.

Furthermore, I was surprised to discover that I had inadvertently paid for baggage on my return ticket. I assumed it covered both legs of the journey. Who charges baggage fees separately for a return trip? As a result, I traveled without luggage, only to realize I had 20 kilograms allocated for my return journey. This practice is highly irregular and indicative of the airline's questionable practices.

I had to take a train to Barcelona. my Avios points I am trying to claim since last year and the multiple forms Iberia has on there website are totally useless, no enough space to add documents. hold off because of special character's on the writing field to describe the issue. totally incompetence. call their customer service for help is another waste of time. I rather speak to a robot, they are unwilling to help, just telling you over and over but not getting out their way to actually help out guiding you how to fill up the forms. the worst airline ever. nt even the supervisors are helpful at all. not in person, nor by phone.

Much more convenient than a rail transfer,Granada,Madrid,Domestic,"I would happily recommend transferring between Granada and Madrid by air, given that the number of direct trains has been reduced, requiring a long connection at Cordoba. 

You need to book well ahead, as the flights are often full. Don’t arrive at Granada airport too soon (1 to 1.5 hours is ample) - the building is quite small and check-in and security are quick and painless. There is a small shop/eatery pre-security. Departures contains a duty-free shop, another, larger self-service café, and a VIP lounge. About 20 minutes before departure, business class pax are called through to the tiny (standing room only) gate area, then everyone else crowds in. A few minutes later, the doors open and everyone follows the short, outside covered walkway to board the aircraft. The journey is on a smaller (2 + 2 configuration) Air Nostrum aircraft and the website guidelines on carry on are a bit confusing. Basically, you get the standard allowance but you are given a tag to attach to any larger bags (anything over 8 kg and 45 x 35 x 20 cm), which you drop at the foot of the aircraft steps as you board. At Madrid, the bags are offloaded before you disembark and are left for you to collect at the bottom of the aircraft steps. The seats were comfy enough for the brief flight – so short that the crew do a drink service in business class (I don’t think business class is worth the extra money on this particular flight).",October 2023,"January 22, 2024",4.0,3.0,3.0,,,4.0,4.0,3.0,
So disappointed!,Madrid,Buenos Aires,International,"We traveled by Premium Economy and we landed 4 days ago, and still don't have my suitcase. The only customer service number they gave us, is completely the same as not having any contact with the company; they made fun of us and told us that baggage theme is not their work just to avoid the responsibility.
It is a total disappointment. The service was good, but today, 4 days after my arrival, they can't even tell me where my suitcase could be.
It is hell trying to communicate with them and many even hang up the phone. Inside the suitcase I have medication that I need, and 3 days ago I reported it with detail and there is no solution.
We were customers, but the truth is that it is a great disappointment.

Viajamos por Turista Premium, llegamos hace 4 días y todavía no tengo mi valija. El único número de atención al cliente nos toman el pelo para no tener responsabilidad, y es una decepción total. El servicio fue bueno, pero hoy, 4 días después de mi llegada, no me pueden decir ni dónde se puede encontrar mi maleta.
Es un infierno intentar comunicarme con ellos y muchos incluso cortan el teléfono. Dentro de la valija tengo medicación que necesito, y hace 3 días lo comuniqué y no hay ninguna solución.

NEVER FLYING IBERIA AIRLINES EVER AGAIN!!!! THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU OR LOST LUGGAGE!!!,Florence,Los Angeles,International,"Ah the saga of my lost carry-on bag. Where do I begin? I'm in my 40's and have flown many times to Europe since I was 20 years old and this was the FIRST time an airline had lost my luggage. I partially blame the ginormous unorganized Madrid (MAD) airport as well. 

I had a carry-on that I was forced to put under the plane in Florence by an already horribly rude lady at 4 in the morning. My route was Florence > Madrid > LAX. It was December 1st 2023. From Florence my mom and I flew with Vueling, we landed in Madrid which we had about a 2 hour layover and then finally landing into LAX, that's when this whole nightmare began. The flight was actually delayed about an hour and then later I found that my carry-on never made it home, but my mom's did. It was still at the Madrid airport.

Let me preface this by saying that I have an air tag which is what saved my sanity and gave me peace of mind. I HIGHLY recommend buying them. So when I finally realize my bag wasn't coming at baggage claim (along with a whole bunch of other people I might add), I file a claim with the Iberian rep LAX guy and from that day forward begin the MANY calls to the Iberia lost baggage customer service people (1-800-772-4642) which I called EVERY DAY, sometimes twice. Once in the morning and once at night. Reading other reviews though, nobody blatantly hung up on me. But they sometimes tried to rush me off the phone after telling me they had no information regarding my claim. It really depends on who you get honestly. Some seem like they know what they're talking about and some don't realize where they are lol. Some did lie to me too telling me at one point they did locate the bag and was waiting for flight info and then the next day saying they hadn't located it and were still searching which definitely angered me and put me on an emotional roller coaster. 

NOBODY knew where the bag was but I did, thanks again to my air tag. I had to tell them exactly where so they could email that info to MAD airport. It was so frustrating seeing exactly where it was which was Terminal 4 (baggage claim) and not being able to just go there and grab it myself. Apparently when you call customer service, they have NO way of communicating to the airport via phone which I thought was crazy and ridiculous. I've never heard of a business that didn't have a higher person you could complain to, let alone a department. Only emails which the airport never responded to, let alone me who desperately tried emailing on my own as well. I took screenshots of the air tag locations, sent them pictures of what the suitcase looked like and literally pleaded with them to please help me. Nobody responded. At one point on a customer service call I was so fed up, tried asking for a supervisor and they ignored my request and kept trying to tell me they were still searching for the bag and there was nothing they could do. This whole experience was so WTF??? I mean I know here in the states for the most part, there's good and bad customer service BUT at least there's a higher up or a supervisor you can try to talk to. Over in Europe I feel like nobody cared and there wasn't a person there to actually take charge and get sh*t done! I really felt powerless that they had my property and I couldn't do anything about it while taking their sweet old time. Even if I threatened to sue which I didn't but was wanting to, they seemed to want to take a siesta first then still not want to help me or take me seriously. The bureaucracy with dealing with a foreign country is something I hope to never have to experience again. Nobody wanted to work and again they did not care. I feel the airport could of also communicated better. They really have to figure out some way to communicate together because their system clearly does not work at all. One of the customer service people did admit that and agree with me as well. It was really unprofessional and there was no accountability at all. I felt like they could do anything they wanted and it didn't matter because their supervisor was probably the same way. I hate to say it but at this point I felt like it was personal seeing I was American which I gathered from other reviews I read on here too. 

THEN after a couple of weeks still calling and them saying they were still trying to find the suitcase, they tell me they're now putting in a special search team to as a special investigation to the matter. I was like just NOW you're going to do this? Sure whatever. So they make another special claim and email me asking what they would find inside if they scanned it for items to make sure it was my bag once they found it. 

Weeks later, nothing again so I keep emailing them screenshots because at this point it has been moving around the airport so SOMEBODY'S been in contact with it and you would think they would at least read my tag on the bag and put two and two together? I see it move to the front of the airport so I think hmmm maybe they did locate it and scanned it as TSA because TSA is at the front of the airport right? Then it's moved back to the middle of the airport. All this time they still don't know where it is because the airport isn't responding back to the Iberia customer service people. 

THEN there's movement. Next thing I know, it's flown to a Barcelona Airport. Like HUH? Ok ...so I think they're going to fly it back from to me from there? I check the flights and there's one the next day going to LAX. I pray that they do that and even call customer service to ask them about it but they have no idea of course and I was like OMG can't someone just communicate something? THEN I see they fly it to the OTHER Barcelona airport nearby.... I was like WHAT? WHY?! THEN a couple days later to some air cargo facility called WFS which stands for Worldwide Flight services which is a third party air transit company that is a part of the airport? At this point I had been trying to call the WFS place AND the lost and found at the Barcelona (BCN) airport and emailing them but of course nobody answers the calls and the recording hangs up on me and nobody answers my emails. At this point it's now almost the middle of December and it totally takes me out of the Christmas spirit. I'm so sad and heartbroken thinking I'll probably never get it back. There were things in there that were irreplaceable and special to me. 

THEN a week later I see it going back to the Barcelona airport then days later back again to the Madrid airport so I call and they say it's finally going on a flight to LAX on New Year's Eve! I actually didn't believe it though because I'd been lied to so many times but I was still trying to be positive and hoping for the best and  guess what, it didn't make the flight lol. Apparently the engineer decided they didn't have room for my bag for the flight. Like I've been waiting a month now and I should have priority at this point but again, THEY DO NOT CARE. So I google to see when the next flight is and it's January 3rd 2024. So I wait and pray it gets on that flight. Now the thing with the air tag is that it needs to be around other apple products for it to ping it's location and early that Wednesday, at 2:35am, it hadn't refreshed or pinged the whole day still showing it was at the Madrid airport but that's only because it actually was on flight IB 6171. Reason being it was down under the plane and everyone's phone was on airplane mode. If it were still at the airport, there would of been activity at some point for it to ping and refresh. So when the plane landed at 3:51 pm at LAX, it refreshed and thank god it was finally here, a MONTH AND THREE DAYS LATER. It MOST DEFINITELY shouldn't of taken that long. People here complaining about 3 days... I only WISH it took that long in my case but unfortunately it did not. Just ridiculous.

I had told the guy who took my claim initially to have it delivered to my house once they found it but now that it was finally home, I just decided to go to LAX last minute after work since it was so close to me and try to just get it myself. After talking to some people I went upstairs to the Iberia check in area at the airport and nobody was there so I had to ask Air France next door to go knock on the door and have one of them come out. A lady did and I explained my situation and she took the original claim form and went back to look for my bag. 10 minutes later, she comes out with no bag saying it wasn't there. She said I'd have to wait for 20 minutes for some guy at baggage claim. I was like look, the bag looks like THIS and showed her a pic. She said ""Oh there was something like that back there but it didn't match up to your luggage tag"" which I thought she meant name tag... but she took a pic of it on her phone and went back again to check again. 5 minutes later she FINALLY rolls out my bag and she still doesn't believe it's my bag. She asks me to open the combination lock as proof. Also my NAMETAG is still attached with my name and all information CLEARLY written on there. The bag opens of course and I tell her didn't you even see my nametag and match it up with the claim form I gave you? She didn't even bother to look anywhere else because that would require more work I guess to look at it and then when she realized she had made a mistake proceeded to tell me that she only scanned the luggage tag because that's all that really mattered. At this point though the original tag was covered with 10 other luggage tags because it had moved all over the place so of course it wasn't going to match up seeing nobody communicates and there wasn't any record of anything! If I didn't even show her a picture of what the suitcase looked like, who knows if I'd even have it right now. These people really have no common sense like AT ALL!!! Or do they care. Even when I finally got my suitcase back, she didn't even seem happy for me which I don't need her to jump up and down but I don't know, pretend you care at all? Especially if it was their fault. I had been waiting over a month to get it back wasting all my time and energy everyday which should of never happened in the first place. Also I asked what the procedure was if they still had to deliver it to my house and she said it would of taken 24 hours and after that I'd have to be present to sign for it and show ID which who knows if I would of been at work because I didn't trust any of them at this point seeing again I went straight to LAX to get it done once and for all. So glad I did that.

Anyways, sorry I didn't mean to write a novel BUT what I learned from this whole horrible ordeal is to BE PATIENT because I didn't lose my temper the whole time also with them on the phone only because I felt that if I yelled or cursed, it would give them a reason to hang up on me and would only worsen the situation, and keep calling and don't let them forget about you. Persist EVERY DAY because they WILL get tired of you and eventually do their job AND BUY AN AIR TAG! Or some type of tracker because I feel like that's really the thing that gave me peace of mind in being positive and information on where my bag was. Even if it's not accurate at times, ANY information is better than nothing at all. I never asked for any compensation either because I read on other reviews that even if you were promised any, it would take months if at all. I was so sick and tired of having to deal with these people that I just want to put all this behind me seeing I finally got my luggage back. And thankfully it was all in one piece too with no damage which was a surprise honestly. If I didn't, then of course I would have to be dealing with that right now. Plus I threw all my receipts away in Italy thinking I didn't need them anymore so I'm sure they would of asked for them and I don't want to give them anymore of my time and energy. Anyways, after this I will MOST DEFINITELY NOT BE flying with Iberia Airlines ever again even if I have to pay a million times more. The energy spent with worry and heartache is something I never want to deal with ever again if I could avoid it. Iberia's whole system is broken with no protocol or structure. Their practices are very illegal and abusive even seeing what others have written. They have over 6,000 1 star reviews on here and only over 3,000 5 star ones so that should definitely tell you that they need to either clean up their act or just go out of business because this irresponsible attitude and bad/rude customer service along with the amount of lost baggage on the daily can't last forever and shouldn't be tolerated AT ALL!!!!! 

ALSO one more thing for the ones who read this thing all the way through, thanks BTW lol. I just got a response back yesterday from Barcelona (BCN) airport from a December 18th email I sent, one of many  (note that it's about a half month later) and they responded with (and I'm paraphrasing), ""Sorry, we don't know where your suitcase is and also this isn't the right department anyways for your problem."" And that was it... no, ""Oh but here's who you can contact... "" OR ""I'll forward this email though to the right department""....They don't care...or even realize I finally got my suitcase back... so yeah... the whole system there is broken for sure.",December 2023,"January 5, 2024",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0

Lost baggage,Miami,Barcelona,International,"On November 17,  I flew from MIA to Barcelona with a Madrid transfer (55 minutes). Upon arrival at my destination, my baggage needed to be included.

At Barcelona Intl, I immediately submitted a PIR form with BCNNIB27062. To date, the website for lost luggage indicated they are still looking for the baggage.

It would have been easy to resolve the problem when I was in Spain for ten days. However, the responses from the Iberia employees were always poor or none at all, not to mention the rudeness of the employees in Spain (Madrid and Barcelona Airports). I kept calling Iberia at the number 1(800) 772-4642; when following the robot's instructions - lost luggage - sometimes, the system transferred me to a human. They constantly say this is different than the correct number and offer other numbers, which either don't work or are in Spain. International calls to Spain are expensive. I was in Barcelona (3 days), and they told me that the lung was in Madrid. When I was in Madrid for three days, they told me the suitcase was in Barcelona.

In agreement with the Montreal Treaty, Iberia paid me $ 1638.66. 
At least they paid me for the loss, although nothing will blow the lousy experience off my mind. I recommend you not travel with a cabin bag in Iberia or put on a tracker because Iberia staff cannot track luggage.

One of the best experiences!,Madrid,Los Angeles,International,"2 Adults, 1 infant (8 months), travel December 2023.

- We called the airlines a day before our flight, and requested a bassinet for the baby. They ensured me that the baby will get a bassinet and assigned me a seat next to it. This was better than American Airlines as they could not ensure bassinet until I was inside the aircraft. It is much less stress when you know for sure that you will get a bassinet.
- At the airport, I requested if they could try to move my wife near me too. They were not able to move her next to me, but they moved her right behind me. Thankful for this. 
- We are vegetarians so most of the times have bad experience with inflight food, but this was so good! I would actually order some of those things at some regular food place and eat. Pasta was really good, dessert chocolate mousse was yum, cheese sandwich, the tapas. 
- The seats were slightly bigger compared to the American Airlines flight I took from US-Spain
- The lavatories are clearly much more roomier than some other airlines and that was great as I changed baby diapers 3 times during the flight. 
- Stroller/Car Seats fly free

"PRESENTING ""CHRISTMAS NIGHTMARE"" WITH IBERIA",Los Angeles,Barcelona,International,"This is one of the worst experiences I've had in my life, I am 52 yo and have been traveling since I was 11yo.  I usually don't have interest or time to write reviews but this time.... It's needed. The overall incompetence trying to book my flight was hard to believe. It all started a month ago when I booked a flight for me and my son to go from LAX to 
Barcelona. When I showed up at LAX, they told me they cancelled my son's flight because they didn't have his passport information. This was news to me, because no one ever called me or emailed me saying they were missing information. When I called them from the airport it took them 1 hour to tell me the flight was full and it took another hour to book us another flight the same day at America Airlines. After 1.5 hours on the phone booking the new flight, we completed the process, I paid, they said they would call me with the confirmation number, but they never did.
When i called again asking for the details to board the plane, they informed me that I didn't have a reservation and now it was too late to get on that plane. I couldn't believe it, because the charge went through. I proceeded to then blood the next flight which was the next day and trying to tell then that they had already charge me, they didn't care and charge me again, stating (you will be reimbursed for sure)  but since they took to long in the system, i lost that flight too, and ended up booking 2 days later. After all this frustration (now I've been in the airport for 5 hrs trying to book a flight with a 13 yo boy who is tired, hungry and frustrated....
They assure me that it is all taken care of, for BOTH of us to fly 2 days later, that they will email me details.... When I come home at 11.30 pm, tired and ready to sleep... I check the next the day my reservation and they messed it up AGAIN!
They had me flying 12/21 from LAX to Madrid... and wait.... then flying the next day from LAX to Barcelona !!!  I don't know if they are of very limited capacity of if they have very little training as they put me on hold multiple times after every little question, making each phone call about 1 hr. 
Now I have to spend a few hours to fix the problem again, and then get the refund of the double charge. What a nightmare! 
Update. now that I fixed the problem, i check my email and the reservations are both under my son's name, i have to call them again to fix that because at this point I DONT TRUST what they tell me, i want it in writing, i don't want to risk losing my flight yet again! 
I hope the airline sees this and invests some money on properly training their staff or firing the people who are evidently incompetent. I know Spanish people to be very smart and efficient in general, they may just be lacking training.

Unprofessional handling of cases of lost luggage,Turin,Montevideo,International,"I am profoundly disappointed with my recent experience with Iberia, and I feel compelled to share the series of unfortunate events that have unfolded:

December 10:
Iberia lost over 20 passengers' luggage, including one belonging to my stepmother, containing various items intended for Christmas. The magnitude of this incident suggests a severe lapse in the airline's luggage handling procedures. I find it perplexing that a plane can depart with missing luggage, and I strongly believe that modern technology could prevent such occurrences. Simple measures, like scanning each piece of luggage before departure, could ensure that no item is left behind and certainly not 20 pieces.

I learnt from another reviewer that Iberia also lost more than 40 pieces of luggage on another flight, also going through Madrid.

December 11:
During a call with customer service to seek clarification, we received verbal confirmation that our delayed luggage had been found, but when politely requesting them to please send a written confirmation, the representative abruptly closed the line. This disrespectful treatment of customers only adds to the overall negative experience.

December 12 Update:
Contacting Iberia again, this time with Carlos, we learned that the company policy prohibits providing written confirmation, and he declined to escalate the case. Carlos mentioned a potential 24-hour delay in updating the status of our luggage. This unwavering adherence to withholding written confirmations, coupled with a refusal to escalate, intensifies our concerns about transparency and accountability, further eroding our trust in the company.

In conclusion, the numerous setbacks, unprofessional conduct, and lack of transparency have significantly marred our experience with Iberia. I sincerely hope for a swift resolution and improved communication, but the sentiment is pointing in another direction.",December 2023,"December 12, 2023",1.0,2.0,3.0,,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0
Lost luggage story,Mykonos,Munich,Europe,"So I lost my luggage during an interconnecting flight from Mykonos > Madrid > Munich. Arrived in Munich only to see hundreds of lost bags in one of the gates thinking “damn someone here can’t do their job properly”. Only to find out after waiting at the baggage belt for 45 minutes that my own luggage is also nowhere to be found. Iberia customer service desk had about 40 people waiting all with the same issue. Mind you I’m traveling Europe alone from Australia to see some friends with baby presents and birthday gifts etc that are all now missing. Iberia informed the bag was found after 48 hours and will be delivered to my hotel in the next 3 days. Only to have a “case closed” without it actually being sent. Now the bag is ACTUALLY “missing” as no one can track it anymore. Spent the remainder of my 18 day trip with no luggage and wearing basically the same clothes (lucky for end of summer Europe weather). I ended up calling the Iberia office, every day, for 18 days until my flight back and not a single person could tell me where that bag is or its last confirmed location. By the time I got back home to Melbourne and settled back in, it had been 24 days since it first went missing. Iberia agreed to pay a standard $1600USD for the lost luggage. Since the initial incident on September 5th till now December 12th, Iberia has given me every excuse from miscommunication between departments to banking and admin errors. I have yet to see a single cent 14 weeks later. Never Fly With Iberia – Solo traveler from Melbourne :)))",August 2023,"December 12, 2023",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2.0

"No Compensation After Being Stranded in Madrid (among a litany of other issues), Staff Unable and/or Unwilling to Help",Boston,Bologna,International,"Iberia is, by far, the worst airline I've flown with. In flying with them round trip from Boston, MA (USA) to Bologna, Italy, I experienced nearly every imagineable flight issue, as well as some which I could not have imagined prior. My flight from Boston was delayed due to weather (not Iberia's fault), but throughout the delay, no information on departure time was communicated to the passengers at the gate. When I landed in Barcelona, Spain, the first of two connecting stops, it was too late to make it to my first connecting flight. Having missed this flight, I went to an Iberia gate where there was another flight to my second connecting stop (Madrid, Spain), which was scheduled to leave in approximately 45 minutes. After waiting for the ticketed passengers to board, the staff at the gate gave no clear indication of how to proceed, but waved me onto the plane without even issuing a formal ticket. This flight landed in Madrid with enough time for me to make my original second connection. However, I was not allowed to board the flight as the gate staff told me that I had been bumped due to the flight being overbooked. After debating with the staff to no avail, I waited in line for two hours to speak to a customer service representaitive to be told that I could join the standby queue for an evening flight to Bologna, and that if there was no room on that flight, I'd be given a hotel voucher and the option to take a flight the following morning. I waited for five additional hours in the airport until the evening flight began to board, a process which started an hour after it was scheduled to, and was ultimately not allowed to board the standby flight. When I went to speak to customer service to get the hotel voucher and a ticket for a morning flight, I was told that I would not be given a hotel voucher, despite having been stranded by the airline at the Madrid airport at what was now just after midnight. The customer service representative also told me that I could not get a morning flight to Bologna, and that my only option was to fly to Venice, from where I'd need to rebook my transfer to the Ravenna cruise terminal (my ultimate destination). With this being my best option, I accepted, but was unable to find a hotel with vacancy and was forced to spend the night in the Madrid airport. My morning flight was relatively uneventful, but after my flight ordeal, Iberia refused to compensate me for my Bologna accommodations, original transfer from Bologna to Ravenna, or rebooked transfer from Venice to Ravenna. I hoped that the worst had passed when I began my return journey, but it had unfortunately only just begun. My flight from Bologna to Madrid was delayed by almost an hour, with all passengers already on the aircraft, and water was only distributed in small cups after 45 minutes with no air conditioning active. When I landed in Madrid, I had to full-on sprint over half the length of the terminal to make it to my first connecting flight, where I was told that I had to check my carry-on bag due to my late arrival. I reluctantly agreed, relieved to have at least made my connection, but when I would finally arrive in Boston, my bag had been lost. I submitted a claim for a lost bag, but when Iberia delivered my bag to me several days later, it was the wrong bag, despite Iberia having been given a description of my bag. After countless calls with Iberia throughout the following weeks and multiple trips to the Boston airport to try and speak with the baggage company that Iberia outsources their operations to, I finally received my bag after two weeks. A pair of shoes inside the bag had been damaged beyond repair, and despite four months of email and phone follow ups, I was declined reimbursement (of less than $50 USD total) for the expenses I incurred in retrieving my lost bag. I was never compensated for the night I spent in Madrid, my damaged shoes, parking expenses at the airport when attempting to retrieve my bag, or any other costs due to the entire experience.

To Balance Out the Negative Reviews here…,Chicago,Malaga,International,"When our itinerary was changed the morning of our trip, an American Airlines agent was able to book the remaining two segments of our journey on Iberia in order to get us to our destination on our planned date.  We rebooked.   Then I made the mistake of jumping down the rabbit hole of reviews here on Trip Advisor.  I was then nervous that our luggage would be lost or our seats given away or flight cancelled or have a terrible inflight experience or…..

I’m here to say that our day was a good day as it was for the other 200+ passengers on our flight to Spain.  The crew was kind and friendly.   Boarding a jumbo jet for a trans-Atlantic flight was done with such quickness and efficiency.  The food was just fine for airline food.   The economy seats weren’t any different than I’ve experienced on other airlines. Our luggage arrived with us.  (For the first time we used AirTags in our suitcases to give us peace of mind.)

The only thing we had to deal with is our boarding passes.  Because this was a day-of  change, our Iberia boarding passes had to be issued at the counters in Chicago and again in Madrid.  There was some delay in “finding us in their system,” but the Iberia agents were patient and helpful.   We were very grateful.  

So… Will I jump at the chance to book with them again? Maybe not as my “go-to” airline.  However, all the traveler horror stories that put me on edge in these reviews did not come to pass and I would not be biting my nails if I had to fly Iberia again.",November 2023,"November 11, 2023",4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0

We had 10 minutes in Spain to get to our connecting flight to Chicago and we asked them to hold the aircraft and they said they would but it would be delayed anyway. They didn’t hold it and we were stuck waiting in a ridiculously long line because they didn’t have nearly the amount of customer service agents helping rebook people. Oh but don’t worry if you’re business class, they will give you the same amount of agents with a MUCH shorter line. So they rebook us for the following day, so they get us a hotel for the night.

Luggage nightmare,San Francisco,Milan,International,"I booked a flight to Italy through British Airways this was my first trip to Europe so I decided to splurge and travel Business Class. Well apparently British Airways bought or partnered with Iberia and my flight to I
Milan went through Madrid.  I checked one bag and had a back pack carry on With a few essentials The actual flight to Madrid was fine airline personnel were very nice and professional. My horror story starts when I arrived in Italy and my bag did not. 
Even though the tag was to go to Milan it was removed in Madrid where it sat for 1 1/2 days.  I fortunately had a Apple air tag in my luggage so I called Iberia to explain where they could locate the bag but they  refused to listen to me and stated we are still looking for your bag and will notify you when we have located it.
Well that took them close to 30 hours.  By that time I had left Milan and was now in Rome. I had already had to buy clothes and toiletries as I had nothing but one pair of Clothes and a few essential items.  I filled out all the appropriate forms and Iberia stated that once my bag was located they would fly it to Rome and have a courier deliver it to the apartment I had rented. So now 2 days passed they let me know my bag was found and they put it on the next flight out to Rome. My bag landed on October 10 at 9  am. The courier picked the bag up the same day in the late afternoon. Iberia notified me my bag would be delivered on the 10 th or  11th.  My bag sat with the courier who knew I was leaving Rome on the 13th for the Tuscany Valley. By 1:30 pm on Thursday October 12 when the courier had not contacted me to set up delivery and multiple calls to Iberia to find out how to contact the courier had failed I decided to take matters into my own hands I hired a taxi to take me where my air tag reported my bag was and voila there it was with dozens of other lost bags.   There were 2 people sitting in the office and no one delivering the lost bags.  I’m just fortunate that I had a tracking device because I am certain my bag would not have arrived prior to me leaving Rome.

We got seats with 2 in a row.  That was nice.  They serve you a meal and you get what you get.  No choice.  I think it may be because they ran out of one of the choices.  And we're in premium economy.  Two bathrooms were locked throughout the flight.  For the entire plane besides first class, only 4 working bathrooms were available.  That was insane.  Upon landing, we the experienced a very hard landing in which I screamed.  Never had a landing like that before.  Then the pilot almost missed a turn on the runway and made a hard left turn.

Nightmare Experience,Caracas,Madrid,International,"I don't usually post on social media, but I feel compelled to share my recent experience with Iberia. On September 24th, I embarked on an intercontinental journey from CCS to BER (return flight), with a brief layover in MAD (1 hour), anticipating my arrival in BER on September 25th. However, my travel plans were marred by an error in Iberia's system during my online check-in. Strangely, the pricing of my reservation changed from economy to business class, yet my ticket price remained in economy. Due to this discrepancy, I was denied boarding. 

Resolving this issue became an arduous task, requiring multiple phone calls (I had to figure out how to call them as my SIM card doesn't work outside EU) and extended periods of waiting, primarily due to the sluggish and overloaded nature of Iberia's systems. After hours on the phone, a resolution was finally reached: a rescheduled flight on September 26th, complete with an extensive 12-hour layover in MAD, and arrival in BER on September 27th at 11 PM, effectively almost September 28th. In essence, I reached my final destination nearly three days later than my originally scheduled arrival.

Understandably, I submitted a formal complaint, only to be met with a response from Iberia that left me utterly dismayed: ""There is nothing we can do for you. Thank you for your understanding."" This response raised a multitude of questions. Who would compensate me for the considerable time lost, the stress, anxiety, frustration, the financial burden, and the loss of working days? I was even forced to consume unplanned vacation days from my limited remaining annual leave. All of this turmoil was the direct result of a system error, which is especially disheartening considering my decade-long loyalty as a customer of Iberia. I've consistently chosen Iberia for my flight bookings, and this is the treatment I receive?

I'd like to conclude by expressing the gravity of the situation I found myself in. I wouldn't wish this kind of experience on anyone. The fear and uncertainty of being stranded in a foreign country, far from your place of residence, with no knowledge of when you can return home, is an unimaginable burden. It becomes even more daunting when you have responsibilities to take care where you live and your hands are tied. Fortunately, I had family in CCS who were able to assist me, but the situation could have been far more dire in a foreign land where you know no one. Once again, my profound disappointment in Iberia's handling of this situation is overwhelming.",September 2023,"October 11, 2023",1.0,2.0,2.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,3.0

I asked what my options were as I was trying to fly back to Australia and was told I could try and ‘get a train’ to Madrid!

Everyone eventually got on and I was left waiting alone with no information wondering how the hell I was going to get home to my family. Finally they let me board and I got my economy seat.

Of course I had my record locator and gave it to him. He was able to find the reservation with  the record locator since my last name was misspelled in their computer.  At this point I was very upset, almost in tears, as I am 73 years old, and was treated like a second class citizen.

Spanish sardine can,Barcelona,New York City,International,"Ah, the enchanting experience of booking a cross-Atlantic flight, only to find yourself bamboozled by an airline that considers bait-and-switching its passengers an art form. Just 24 hours before departure, they play the game of ""Guess the Carrier,"" and you get the privilege of discovering you'll be flying on a budget airline, a Spanish sardine can with wings. ""LEVEL""

As if that weren't delightful enough, imagine spending nine hours trapped in a cramped space with no free food. It's like being cast adrift on the high seas with a paddle made of credit cards. Hungry travelers are expected to shell out exorbitant sums for meals that wouldn't pass muster at a high school cafeteria.

But the pièce de résistance of this airborne carnival of horrors is your coveted seat assignment: directly in front of the lavatory. The constant cacophony of flushing and the joy of watching a never-ending line of desperate souls queuing for the facilities will have you yearning for a parachute to escape this airborne prison.

WORST AIRLINE ON THE PLANET,Munich,New York City,International,"Worst airline ever. If there would be zero stars or negative stars available, I would pick that.

It was originally supposed to be an American Airlines flight, but we got rebooked to Iberia (for reasons unknown). Everything went fine until the actual boarding of the plane, where the exact same lady that checked us in earlier, assigned our seats, got us our boarding passes etc., told us that our ticket number was invalid and we couldn't board our flight, literally 15min before the plane actually took of. We asked how that could be since we were already checked in, got our boarding passes etc., but received no understandable explanation. We panicked and called our contact person at the travel agency, who wanted to talk to the flight attendant of Iberia in person, but the flight attendant refused to talk to her and sent us away. The travel agency said it was clearly the fault of Iberia that we didn't get a correct ticket number and that they simply had to let us board the flight. Anyways, they wouldn't let us board, we therefore also missed our connecting flight. We went to the Iberia counter and asked if they could set us up with another flight etc., but they said it wasn't their fault, they refused to talk to us any further and denied us any service and help altogether. 

End of story is, we had to book an entirely new flight FOR THE NEXT DAY with another airline, an accommodation for the night, a taxi to and from the hotel, ALL AT OUR OWN EXPENSES. Our travel agency helped us with it, without them we would have been stranded on the airport completely. Never in my life have I (and also no one in my circle of family, friends and collegues) experienced such an effrontery and incompetence from any airline anywhere the world. Our travel agency said that they would do anything to get a refund for our expenses, I am really intrigued how that's going to turn out and if we really get our money back.

Incompetence with baggage,New York City,Barcelona,International,"I traveled to Barcelona. One part of my trip was to spend a few days in the Pyrenees Mountains to go bike riding. I paid a higher fare to be allowed to check two bags. I packed my very nice road bike in its special case. I checked it as luggage. The bike box never left JFK. I was told it wuld likely arrive in the next 24 hours as Iberia would put the box on a flight to Madrid or Barcelona (several flights a day to each city) and then transport to my hotel. 

4 days later, my bike is still at JFK. I know this because it has an Air Tag on it and I can see exactly where it is. Guess what? Iberia and its barcode tracking system has no clue where it is. I had to tell the Iberia representative that ""my Air Tag says it is near such and such store in Terminal 8.""

At one point Iberia told me it was on flight IB 2628 the day after I flew. That was wrong (or a lie.) I have called the missing luggage center several times and nobody there can tell me how Iberia plans to locate the luggage. They cannot tell me when I can expect to recover my belongings. They cannot tell who is responsible for finding my belongings and getting them to me. They cannot tell me even who is in charge and can look for ""out of the box"" solutions.

Iberia said it would reimburse ""basic expenses"" to cover what's missing, including a rental, but that won't cover $400 cycling shoes that I would need to purchase, or similar cycling clothing. In short, my trip is basically ruined because I cannot do what I came here to do.

Not only is this in itself wrong that they had overbooked, but the way the Iberia staff spoke to us was extremely rude, their attitude toward us was as if they were police officers and had caught us for committing a crime.

I did not like her dismissive attitude so I expressed that we should not be picked randomly out of the line in this way, and she then used a racial word to refer to me (I am east asian) in Spanish to her colleague thinking I wouldn't understand.

Avoid at All Costs: A Nightmare of Incompetence and Customer Disdain,Bordeaux,Fuerteventura,Europe,"Absolument, voici une version encore plus tranchante :

I am utterly disgusted by the abysmal service provided by Iberia. The entire experience has been nothing short of a nightmarish ordeal that I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy.

To begin with, the communication was nothing but a pathetic display of incompetence, leaving me clueless and frustrated. But the real horror began when I realized that my luggage had been lost. It's simply infuriating that a company of this stature can't handle something as basic as safeguarding passengers' luggage.

What followed was a wretched scavenger hunt in Fuerteventura, where I had to waste half a day of my vacation scrambling to find essential items in a nearby town due to the scarce options available where I was stationed. This inconvenience forced me to incur astronomical costs, the majority of which Iberia has audaciously refused to reimburse adequately.

Their pitiful compensation is nothing but a cruel joke. Offering a measly sum that barely covers the cost of a swimsuit, while I have lost valuable time and money, is an insult to injury. Iberia seems to have no semblance of respect or concern for their customers, leaving them in a perpetual state of uncertainty and distress without a shred of empathy or responsibility.

To add salt to the wound, the uncertainty surrounding the return of my luggage pushed me to possibly buy more than needed, with the threat of having to repeatedly travel to get necessities looming over me due to the unclear timelines given by others who were also at the mercy of Iberia's inefficiency.

I vehemently warn anyone considering flying with Iberia to think again. This experience has been a hellish journey through neglect, sheer incompetence, and a heartless disregard for customer satisfaction and well-being. Save yourself the agony and choose any other airline, because Iberia clearly doesn't give a damn about you or your belongings.",July 2023,"September 11, 2023",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

The trip from Hell on Iberia/American air line,Madrid,Washington DC,International,"I have been a frequent traveler since 2013. And my sister since 2004. We have traveled the world! We are also 2 black girls ( you will see the relevance of this as you read on). We had the worst experience ever with Iberia with a taste of racism. The customer service is the worst I have ever experienced in my whole entire life. In short, we upgraded to business class, and paid the full amount using my card. But once we arrived at the business checking point, we were told that we could not board business even though we paid and they actually took the money from my account. They said business class is full and  it’s no refund. For more details and for how we felt discriminated against as black girls, please read the full story below:

 Let me explain in details what happened: My sister and I upgraded to  2  business class tickets on a flight from Spain to the US (Washington DC). I paid with my card. I had a confirmation email with flight information. They even took the money out of my account almost immediately. So then, the day of the flight, we went to check in in the business line. The ticketing agent was rude to begin with. How was she rude? As soon as we came up to her counter: she said: “ you are not business class, you are economy. We replied: yes, we are business class because we paid for it”. She told us that all the seats in business class were full. And then we said: we booked and paid in full for business class and then we showed her our confirmation email and flight info. And we added: “On top of that the money is gone from my account already and how come they took my money and overbooked the business class”. She said: “I don’t know I can’t help you with that because it’s my time to take launch. I have to go”. And then, she walked away from us and left us standing there with no one to help us. Her colleagues did not pay us any attention. We looked around and saw the customer service desk and we went to the desk behind us. We stood in line for approximately 1 hour before we were able to talk to someone at the customer service counter. Mind you, our boarding time was approaching. We were anxious. 

Remember, we are 2 black girls in line and I counted 8 white folks in the same line. Please, tell me why the white lady at the customer service counter, got out of her seat and approached my sister and I who are two black girls and said; “this is not economy line. This is business line. The economy line is towards the back, please. You must go there to be served”. Let’s talk about this: there were 8 white people in line. Why did she not tell them the same thing? Why did she choose us, 2 black girls to say this to? There were white folks in front of us and behind us. When I  replied: “We are in the right line Madam”. She looked at us and asked: but this is business class: “are you business class”? I nicely said “yes”. But I was boiling inside 😡. 

When it was  finally our turn, the lady at customer service told us that we couldn’t get our money back nor could we get on business because it’s full. At this point we were frustrated. I had paid for international phone service so I had good connection so I called my bank. My bank told me they could not cancel the transaction and that I had to cancel it from Iberia. Basically, they took our money and did not let us book on business class nor did they refund our money. they said these exact words: “business class is full and we cannot refund you the money”! That’s not all! Wait for it. Keep reading. I promise, it’s almost done! 

So now, we were given seats in economy after paying for business class and not being refunded. In addition, they refused to check in our bags unless we paid extra. Mind you, business class comes with 4 check bags for 2 people. So now after paying for business class, not only we are being told that we can’t get business class because it’s full, we have to go to economy, but also we can’t check in any bag unless we pay extra! How much worst could this get on top of being discriminated against! We didn’t want to miss our flight so we paid extra to check in our bags in economy after they took our money for business class and refusing to refund it.

Iberia might be worst customer service ever!,Venice,Madrid,Europe,"I have a mobility scooter for my disability.  I booked the day before so did not have time to submit information, but have never had issue with any airline prior.  

After arriving 3 hours early for 12pm flight, the gate opened at 10am, after about an hour of trying to figure out the battery, they changed me to the 7pm flight to allow me time to get emails from manufacturer regarding type of battery.  The counter would reopen at 5pm, I received the emails and showed the documentation, but they said it wasn’t sufficient for this type of battery.  When I called manufacturer, they said the airline was confused about lithium battery versus wet cell battery.  They sent another email to explain the difference.  Now the airline realized they were looking at wrong documents on their side and sent manager.  Now they tried to change saying they couldn’t prove these emails belonged to this scooter, even though I had the original purchase and all the emails under same email.  I was still understanding and understand, and just asked for my refund.  She said I would need to call, i agreed.  Then she insisted on explaining that this battery was not the battery the manufacturer of scooter and the battery manufacturer were claiming.  I told her maybe she is correct, I’m not a battery expert, all I can do is ask the people who made the mobility scooter.  When I was trying to call for refund, she persisted to keep talking and her colleagues were even laughing.  I just spent 8 hours waiting at airport, now I have no flight, have to call for refund, and she wanted to continue to tell me I was lucky they rebooked me with no cost and it was my fault.  I never once raised my voice, I asked her just to stop talking to me, but she continued to persist I MUST LISTEN TO HER.  I finally ignored her and said my review would talk for me.  After minutes of her talking, she realized I wouldn’t respond and she walked away.  She might be the most rude human being I have ever encountered.  I preach kindness, happiness, and love.

Big Improvement,Madrid,Mexico City,International,"I must say I was very pleasantly surprised on my last flight with Iberia. Well, that was easy as my expectations were low. It was on an A350-900 with a very neat cabin. Everything worked and I was lucky enough to have an empty seat between me and my neighbor. The big surprise was the crew. From my older experience they would serve the meal and then disappear for the rest of the flight. This time we were served three meals! Incredible! a proper lunch then a mid-flight tapas snack and finally a great tuna sandwich before arrival. The crew also went through the cabin with drinks and water regularly. Felt like a transformed airline. I had flown them a lot in the past but then avoided them for a few years. They definitely have improved a lot.

The Worst Airline in the World,Madrid,Los Angeles,International,"DETAILS ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE: I booked an economy ticket LAX-Madrid and paid for exit row seats on both flights. At the airport, I was informed that my paid seats were taken, even though I had a confirmed seats email from Iberia. On the outbound flight, they put us on the plane's last row (from my booked and paid row 23). After we sat, other passengers came claiming the same seats and we had to be separated and moved to middle seats. 
On the returning flight, I confirmed the seats over the phone the day before the flight and still, they separated us and assigned us in middle seats. They lied and bullied us during the check-in process. After taking off, the entertainment system and wi-fi crashed and we were stuck in a plane for 12 hours just with horrible food and service. When we landed thy said: We are sorry for the inconvenience.
I applied for a refund for the almost $400 I paid for the exit row seats and Iberia refused to refund me. The whole situation is so absurd that is almost unbelievable that an airline can be this callous. Customer service was unhelpful and condescending.

Fellow travelers, this is a warning from an experienced traveler that for the first time flew on the Spanish national airline: 
Iberia
and after my experience on a round-trip flight from Los Angeles to Madrid, I can say that I found the worst airline in the world. From customer service (or complete lack of) check-in and onboard crew - everything is just terrible and extremely unprofessional on Iberia.

Garbage customer service,Paris,Madrid,Europe,"Both Iberia and eDreams have some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I had ordered a plane ticket from Paris to Madrid and noticed within 5 minutes of the order that there was a mistake. My computer for whatever reason had switched my name to Jared Paul (my middle name) and not Jared Vigil (my actual name) with the autofill feature. Again, it was within 5 minutes of the purchase so I gave eDreams a call. I was told that they can only change 3 letters and that even my small last name of Vigil would not be allowed to be corrected. I was then told to call Iberia and see if they could do anything about it. Classic shifting the responsibility back and forth onto the other company and leaving the customer getting hit back and forth like a game of tennis. Iberia told me they could do nothing about it but their company would end up penalizing eDreams for not providing a good enough service. I doubt that will actually happen. I ended up calling each company back for a span of two hours probably trying to get this issue resolved. Eventually, I thought for sure my problem would be fixed when eDreams said they would be able to fix my problem if Iberia simply sent them an email saying it was okay to change my name. Apparently a simple email was too much to ask for as I was told Iberia doesn't send any information by email which is a total joke. How would anything get done at the company without using email as a way to convey information? They send flight confirmation emails, so a simple email with a few words saying ""yes, you can change the name"" doesn't seem like such a crazy ask. But no, just typical garbage customer service on both their ends. I eventually had to cancel my flight and rebook losing out on $90 of airfare for such a silly mistake.

Bullied by Iberia,New York City,Barcelona,International,"My wife and I flew with Iberia to Barcelona with our 2 toddlers and a high end sturdy 3-parts stroller (Uppababy) which have flown 50+ times with us (we fly a lot, with the kids). Our Stroller was not broken once in any of these flights. We have delivered the 3 pieces of the storller to the Iberia team, each well-folded as we always do. We received a unusable broken stroller, broken in 5 separate locations over each of the 3 pieces. This is beyond negligence. It’s between gross negligence and outright vandalism.

We complained and after having our time wasted in the airport, without any alternative solution offered (it’s not their problem our week long trip to Barcelona is ruined, where we have 2 toddlers and no stroller), were asked to also file a complain digitally. That led to an endless game where Iberia simply refused to pay for their damages. They made up a “broken beyond repair” certificate which “every store has” and “if only we got it we will be paid back”. We have gone to several stores, both dedicated kids/stroller stores and large chains who sell strollers like Walmart and Target. No one has heard of that certificate. When explained to Iberia they insisted it exists and will only pay if we get it. When we asked for “just one example of one store that has these certificate in Texas” they refused to provide one example, and repeated the mantra. This is beyond poor customer services - this is bullying!

Is this the service Iberia is aiming for and the brand it aims to build?

Staying kind, humble & friendly with all people is a must especially when it comes to customer service, most importantly when customers reveal times of desperation & exhaustion. I understand if you don’t have answers, you can be frustrated moreover if many people are coming to you with the same questions. Have a better plan, talk to everyone as a whole then! All the gate lady kept saying is she knows just as much as us and continues to laugh nervously, shake her head at everyone, and just sit there in her phone. To not even try & get answers from your team is blatantly wrong of a gate attendant to act on. The gate attendant told me to book a different flight at gate 204 if i would like to go grab my checked bag and rebook. She said she will call baggage and tell them i will retrieve my bag & rebook. I asked her to ask them first if the bags are still on the cart, or already boarded on the plane. This will be my determining factor on if i should book a different flight, or stick to this one. She rolls her eyes at me, sighs and tells me she needs to know if I’m going to get a flight before she calls them. I tell her i will not give my word until I know that piece of information because I simply will not promise something that may result in me not following through. So she says something under her breath and finally calls them, throwing her hands and getting all excited on the phone. I’ve never dealt with such improper behavior before, and felt rather embarrassed for her being that way. She comes back to me and tells me that my bag is already on a plane so I can not book another flight anyways? How does that make any sense that our baggage is on a plane, yet we aren’t. Even if that was the case, I’ll fly with a different airline & just grab my bag from the airport when time permits. 

I’ve experienced delays with 3 different European airlines before (EasyJet, WizzAir, Vueling, & RyanAir- not just once, but multiple times) & never were they this RUDE, rather they do everything they can to make the customers feel comfortable!) this is my first & last time ever flying with Iberian Airlines. Even the customer reps I spoke to on the phone did not care one bit. I’m very upset with how this airlines has been treating me and other customers that put money towards this company which absolutely SUCKS. Avoid them at all costs! People I’ve spoken to here also say this isn’t the first time it’s happened to them with this airline & i encouraged them to write reviews so that others are aware of these horrible experiences.",July 2023,"July 21, 2023",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
Avoid Iberia like the plague.,Barcelona,San Francisco,International,"I cannot begin to express my utter disappointment with Iberia Airlines.  I am an expat living in Spain for the last 8 years.  As Iberia is the main Spanish airline and I travel quite a bit, I unfortunately find myself using this airline frequently.

I won't get into the details of how this airline has completely and utterly failed even the most minor test of customer service over the years, as I do not have the time to write a novel.  However I will tell you that their ""customer service"" people are mislabeled in the extreme, and their website seems designed to fail if you even breathe in the general direction of having an issue you want resolved - it will repeatedly pop up with messages that the system is ""not available at this time"" or similar.  I was told that this is because I have a Mac and it works better in PCs which is either the worst lie ever told or they need to fire their web team and hire someone remotely competent.

If you fly this airline, keep your expectations low.  Then lower them some more.  And if you need customer service, consider instead seeking divine intervention - it's more likely to actually produce results.",July 2023,"July 21, 2023",1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0

As I was not getting anywhere with the operatives on the phone, I raised a complaint with a well-written letter explaining my problem and frustration. I had a generic reply 7 days later stating that they can't help me and not even replying to my questions. Terrible! I would give it 0 stars if I could. Never again.

Awful check in experience,Manchester,Madrid,Europe,"Thursday 13 July 2023 was my first experience of flying with Iberia. I found having to wait until 24 hours before the flight to check in unnecessary. To avoid this I ended up paying extra for 4 flights (that had been included in my original booking fee) to ensure we all sat together. 

When we arrived at Manchester airport, 3 hours before, the desk numbers were not visible. However we were told which desks they would be. 2 1/2 hours before the flight we started to queue up at the unopened desks. There was already a large queue building. Harry Styles was playing in Madrid the next day and the queue contained a lot of teenagers going to the concert. 

When checkin opened there were two Iberia staff checking the cases in. The first group were a group of about 8 who were slowly checked in with the exception of one of the girls. I don’t know what had gone wrong but it took 50 minutes to sort this one girl out. This meant that there was only one check in desk active for the whole queue. We effectively didn’t move for an hour. I can’t understand why a member of Iberia staff didn’t come from the back to sort out the girl so that the 2nd check in desk could clear the queue. At no point was any explanation given to anyone. It was a very stressful situation.  It would put me off flying with Iberia again.",July 2023,"July 18, 2023",1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0
The worst airline,New York City,Barcelona,International,"To start don’t purchase seats on Level/Iberia. Airlines, no point. I paid for two seats going and coming; when we checked in they said, “oh sorry we gave you different seats”. Mind you I paid extra for seats all the way upfront and they put us in the back of the plane. There was no accountability nor accommodating us for both of our flights. Our flight outbound was nothing memorable. The seats on the flight were horrible, extremely uncomfortable.  As soon as I got on the plane I needed the restroom. Now mind you, they are boarding new passengers on a new flight, yet the bathroom smelled like pee and has no toilet paper. There was trash everywhere. I was the first person to use the restroom and was completely disgusted. I immediately told the attendees that the bathroom needs to be cleaned. Within a 7 hour flights we were never asked if we wanted a cup of water. Also, my flight home was beyond a horrible experience. Sitting in the aisle row is a nightmare. The flight attendants were passing by continuously for 8 hrs and banging into me every single time and even kicked the passengers foot next to me to move his feet. So, if you’re trying to sleep on a 8 hour flights it’s impossible. On top of that only the people who pre-ordered food we tended to. Other guests apparently don’t have trash to throw out nor need assistance. This is the worst airline I have ever flown on aside from Norwegian Airways. In hindsight it seems like a better deal saving money taking this ratchet airline, but I strongly recommend taking any other airline.",July 2023,"July 17, 2023",1.0,,,,,,,,
Rough trip,Los Angeles,Madrid,International,"We took Iberia to do lax-madrid and malaga to Lax (3 peoples), so long flight, the return  Madrid Lax is 12.5 hours direct plus malaga madrid portion. I do not write reviews on airlines as I believe it is a waste of time as airlines don't care and we all know how bad it is to travel economy those days. But for this one, I changed my mind out of frustration. Great plane, Airbus A350-900, pretty new and spacious (configuration is 3-3-3 in economy) and we were 3, so good. But the staff, PFUFFF.... rude, not helpful, bump into you all the time in you seat in a aisle, over and over and over, without any apologies. Diner trays were being cleaned and 2 flight attendant stop at my seat to exchange things and talk and I could not move for 5 minutes, had to go on my left side, another time kick me in the elbow with a cart, many kick while walking by even if I not going over my seat. It happened, not many space but at least apologize, sorry, pardon,... not once it happened and when you asked them to be careful, they ignore you. Morning breakfast come in a box and the staff literally through it on your table, weird... Talking about food, my dog eat better, this is what you have for 12.5 hours: Hot meal, this time was pasta in tomato sauce and BBQ chicken, both were horrible and very small portion, the pasta was pasta and tomato sauce, no cheese, herbs, ..., then a piece of bread, 1 small potato salad and 1 chocolate mousse for desert, of course all portions are from the children menu... No butter, no little piece of cheese, no little fresh mint, no dressing, ... really bad.  End of flight meal was a tuna sandwich(??), luxurious! I know, nobody  eat well in economy but come on!! on Iberia, dogs will pass on the meal and will rather starve.

"There's bad airlines, then there's 50 feet of crap... and under that is Iberia Airlines.",Madrid,London,Europe,"We booked a flight from Madrid (MAD) to Los Angeles (LAX) with American Airlines (AA). There were no direct flights, so AA partners with airlines like Iberia (IB) to make connecting flights. AA had us fly from MAD to London Heathrow (LHR) with IB, and from there we would take a direct flight from LHR to LAX with AA. We only had 90 minutes to catch the connecting flight, so when our IB flight was delayed for over 2 hours, we knew that we weren't going to make our connecting flight. I spoke with an IB employee while we were still in Madrid, and asked them if we should still fly to LHR since we're missing the connecting flight (or at the very least, start making accommodations for an alternate connecting flight). The IB employee said that there's nothing they can do at MAD, so we should take the flight to LHR and that they would figure it out once we arrive to London. We arrive at London 4 hours late (3 from the delay at MAD, and another hour at the gate at LHR because the door was jammed and they couldn't get it open... it's ridiculous but it really happened). Once we finally got out, there were no IB employees at LHR (they all leave at 8pm), so we went to AA's customer service. Well, AA can't help us because it's IB who was delayed (not AA's fault) , so the protocol in the airline industry is that the airline that caused the delay (IB) is the one responsible for making it right (I verified this with employees from other airlines, and that is the protocol) . Only problem is that all IB employees are gone for the night (they won't return until 6am), and their 24-hour customer service is trash, to say the least. The four different IB customer service reps that I spoke with said that since I bought the tickets from AA, that it's AA (and not IB) who have to book me a new flight home. Again, this is completely false (several reps from other airlines confirmed that it's IB that has to fix the problem because they were the reason why I missed my connecting flight). After 4 different phone calls totalling 90+ minutes on the phone (which I have to pay my carrier by the minute since I'm in a foreign country) IB was able to book us a flight to Paris, and from Paris take a 13-hour flight to LAX. Unbelievable... THAT was their solution to the problem that THEY created. Also, not once did they mention that we can get a hotel for the night and that they would have to reimburse us. However, we know our rights as airline passengers, and when I mentioned this, the IB reps were extremely vague as to how I can get reimbursed, or what my allowance was. The fact that these reps were vague in their response and shady when it came to taking responsibility (and the fact that our flight would require us to he back at the airport in less than 6 hours), we ended spending the night at LHR airport. For the record, AA doesn't get a pass on this SNAFU either, but IB is mostly at fault for this. It pains me to say this since I'm half-Spanish and I remember flying directly from LAX to MAD with IB as a kid when my mom would take us to visit my grandparents, but this cluster-f*** is unforgivable.

The airline provided us with a receipt that had no logo or much information that could identify them, It should be noted that none of the passengers on this flight received their luggage, so the airline should easily identify what happened. The luggage was finally delivered on the eve of our departure to Rome, which means that we practically spent our entire stay in Madrid without our luggage. Upon my return to Mexico City, I initiated the process of filing a complaint regarding the inconveniences caused by this airline, and initially, Iberia showed a willingness to provide a refund. They requested my bank account information and copies of the expenses incurred. However, after I sent them all the required information, they stopped responding to my emails, and my calls went unanswered. It's a shame that an airline conducts itself in this manner.

It wasn't too long, maybe 50 people spread across 4 lines.  There were 3 agents, so two lines were going to one agent.  Every family took 20 minutes or more due to them having lots of luggage or sending a child solo.  The agent that was covering two lines (that we were second in line for) got up and said he was ""done"" and told his line to see his colleague.  His other two colleagues had long lines, which left it to us to just crowd in with the other lines.  We finally were next, but she took another family that was waiting somewhere else.  The two burnt out agents never showed any urgency, laughing and talking to each other about non work related things.  Finally, we checked in and we had less than 20 minutes to get to the plane and my wife asked her if they would hold the plane, whe said ""if it's delayed"".  I asked why it took an hour, and she said ""we are only two people"".  That was exactly what I was thinking!  I said yes that's a problem, and she shoved our passport across the counter without even looking at us.  By running through the airport, we made it to the plane as they were shutting the doors.

Absolutely horrible experience...ruined first leg of our family vacation,Boston,Barcelona,International,"#iberianeveragain.
My wife and I had spent 8 months planning a trip for our family of five.  We had flight confirmation for all of us with American Airlines and were flying out of Boston to Barcelona with Iberia which was part of the booking.  When we arrived in Boston for our flights to Barcelona, we were told by the Iberia agent that four of our family members had boarding passes but one of our daughters did not have a confirmed pass.  I showed the agent the emails I had received stating that all members of our family had been confirmed for the flight with American Airlines (through Iberia).  We had flown to Boston from Indianapolis so I was able to show the Iberia agent our luggage tags for all five of our family members showing that we had confirmed flights for everyone from Indy to Barcelona with a layover in Boston.  The agent searched and again said that she didn't have any record of our daughter being confirmed for the flight to Barcelona and was told that we needed to go to the American Airlines counter to discuss.  We had already spent about 45 minutes with the Iberia agent at this point.  The check-in counter for American was 1 mile from the Iberia counter and there were no shuttles available at that time to take us to the other terminal.  All five family members ran from Iberia to AA (15 minutes) only to find out that there were no agents at the AA counter.  It was now about 1.5 hours before our flight was to leave.  So we ran back to the Iberia counter and told them there was nobody at the AA counter.  I asked them to look again to see why they weren't seeing my daughter's boarding pass and how would it be possible for us to have all of our luggage for all five passengers from Indy to Barcelona approved on the initial check-in if we ALL did not have boarding passes.  I asked if they could check to see if there was room on the flight to add my daughter because at that point I was desperate to get her on the flight and was willing to pay the money to make that happen.  The agent said that ""yes, there is room on the flight"" but that we need to book the flight with American.  At this point, we had spent an additional 30 minutes arguing with them and it was getting close to the time that they were shutting the doors for the flight.  Another Iberia agent was calling American for us and we were told that there was now someone waiting for us at American Airlines counter at the other terminal.  We ran back again to the American Airlines counter and talked with an agent who, within three minutes, pulled up the boarding pass for my daughter.  At that point, the cabin doors to the plane had closed and we were no longer able to fly out that night.  When I asked the AA agent why Iberia wasn't able to see the boarding pass, she told me that she didn't know as they are privy to the same information that AA was and that the Iberia agent just didn't dig enough to find the boarding pass.  I can't tell you how upset my wife, my daughters, and I were about this.  We had two rooms booked in Barcelona and had planned on sightseeing in the city before getting on a cruise line for Spain, France, and Italy the following day.  When I called to cancel our rooms in Barcelona I was told that it was not within the 24-hour period of time to cancel.  So we're out $1,000 for the two rooms.  More importantly, our overall plan was to give our children an experience of a lifetime by starting our journey out sightseeing in the beautiful city of Barcelona.  8 months of planning, and everything spoiled due to Iberia not doing their jobs correctly.  It's also important to note that both of these agents from Iberia, along with a third that joined the discussion, only spoke in Spanish when not addressing us.  Given the circumstances, my wife and I felt that was extremely disrespectful.  Lastly, I am not an unreasonable person. Everyone makes mistakes and everyone has a bad day.  However, after pleading with them to take a closer look and to have them pass the buck to American Airlines, I think something needed to be said.  Coincidentally, the next day, when we were able to fly out of Boston on Iberia, the same person that had tried to help us the night before was there.  I asked to speak directly to her.  When I told her that AA had no trouble at all pulling up the boarding passes for all five of our family members, she said ""Yes, I heard about that this morning and it was completely our mistake for not getting your daughter on that flight last night""   I am going to be reaching out to Iberia to pay for the hotel rooms that we had to pay for in Barcelona...but there is no way to repay my three daughters for the experiences that they missed out on...it was an absolutely horrible experience and one that was avoidable.

Worst experience of my life.,Madrid,London,Europe,"We booked and paid for exit seats, and when for what ever reason the air waitress found I had cancer I was told I couldn’t have these seats I paid for and must move or else, I asked what do you mean by else, only to be greeted by another exceptionally rude air waitress asking me, “ am I refusing to move” to which I replied no, I’m asking what’s the “else” is. She got more frustrated , aggressive and rude so I therefore decided to start a recording and from this she seems to whisper to her college and  back off and disappear. 10 mins later her senior colleague came to explain and to her I also explained and said I was happy to move - she continued to go and get advise from the caption whose response was to leave things how they where, I thanked her and asked her to thank the captain she to then walked away only to come back 10 mins later as we where about to take off to say how her colleague was crying and in actual fact was pushing me for a reaction in order to start an argument to which I ignored and didn’t. 

The whole experience was so bad that my wife and I have decided to make a formal complaint against the airline and all three of the air waitress that made us feel uncomfortable and spoke to us in a disgusting way. 

I was discriminated against for having cancer and told I was unable to help in an emergency therefore I couldn’t  have the seats I paid for even though I need the extra leg room to stretch to avoid blood clots.

Perfectly fine for cheap(ish) long-haul!,Madrid,San Jose,International,"I flew from Madrid to Costa Rica recently with Iberia and on the whole, the experience was fine! I'd not flown long-haul for several years, and never with Iberia so I wasn't 100% sure how it would be but it was fine. My one main disappointment was that upon boarding the in-flight screens suggested that there would be wifi available - which I thought would be great as it was an 11 + 1/2 hour flight! However, throughout the whole duration, no one was able to get wifi - it would just not work, either free or paid for it was just unavailable for the whole flight. However, there were plenty of in-flight entertainment options plus USB ports to keep phones etc charged which was welcomed. The seats were comfy enough with adequate legroom and you got a pack with a pillow/blanket/headphones too. The food/drink was nice, although, unlike some other long-haul airlines, the drinks were only included at meal times. For your main meal, you had a selection of two items, it was Spanish Chicken and chorizo in a tomato sauce with a salad or some type of pasta and a sponge cake with a choice of wines or soft drink/tea/coffee and water - all of which were nice. I think later on during the flight they came around offering a banana or another piece of cake and some more water/tea/coffee and then before landing they brought around a cheese panini (which was the only thing that wasn't great).

Terrible experience with IBERIA this summer,Los Angeles,Madrid,International,"I'll tell you about my experience with Iberia this summer: On Wednesday, June 14th, we were flying with a direct flight to Madrid from Los Angeles. 20 minutes after takeoff, the captain announces that there is a technical malfunction and we won't be able to fly to our destination. Instead, we will have to circle in the air for 2-3 hours to reduce weight and land safely. We landed with fire trucks and police cars everywhere. At the airport, they gave us a copy of our rights and the website where we can file a complaint, but they didn't tell us when we would be able to fly because that information will come in an email since the airport staff doesn't have access to ticketing. We go home, luckily we live relatively close. We receive an email telling us that we are flying in 2 days, on a flight with a layover in Dallas partially operated by American Airlines. On Friday, we go to the airport again only to find out that American Airlines doesn't have seats for us. We spent 4 hours on the phone with different people from Iberia, they hang up on us 3 times. We asked to speak to the manager and they denied it or told us a manager would call us back ( no one ever called us). Everyone gives us different answers to evade responsibility until we finally find someone who manages to get us a flight for Sunday, 4 days later than originally planned. We had to change our train tickets twice, we were travelling with a 4-year-old child who doesn't understand what's happening and why we are going back and forth to the airport. Like us, there are 300 people with 300 different stories. From the family with a baby who were supposed to fly on Monday and are still fighting at the airport on Friday, as they need to get to Spain before a close family relative undergoes a bone marrow transplant, to the family that has to make it to their best friend's wedding in a small village in Malaga on Saturday (and of course, they have already lost the two days they were planning to visit Granada). But Iberia doesn't care at all. Clearly, they have no plan for when there is a technical malfunction and they have to rebook 300 passengers on other flights, and clearly, they don't want to make the necessary efforts for their passengers to fly as soon as possible and avoid the hell we have all experienced.

MEDIOCRE BUSINESS CLASS  MADRID-SAO PAULO,Madrid,Sao Paulo,International,"We usually fly with Air France or Lufthansa, but just took a transatlantic flight with Iberia from Madrid to Sao Paulo, Brésil, in business class.
Iberia 6827 left at 23:55 from Madrid beautiful Bajaras airport, and landed in Sao Paulo GRU chaotic airport  at 05:50 the next day.
The good things about this flight were the lie-flat seats allowing us to sleep, the flight itself which left and arrived on time, and the value for the money : it was indeed way less expensive than Air France. 
However everything else (food and service) was abysmal! Stewards looked exhausted and overwhelmed. My inflight entertainment system did not work ( my screen stayed stuck on the bright orange Iberia ad during the whole flight ; and when I called my steward, who I must admit had a good sense of humor, he asked me how I had managed to break it… then remarked that I didn’t need it as I was going to sleep ! Finally, I had to ask for a blanket to cover the screen to stop the glare, as no one could turn it off ! All in all, the whole Business class cabin was far from calm, serene and classy !
But we arrived on time and relatively rested !
My advice if you take this flight :
Stop at the Dali or Velasquez lounges at Terminal 4, in the gorgeous Madrid airport designed by Calatrava. Have dinner then a shower before boarding. Go to sleep as soon as you board to avoid all the fuss and highly mediocre food and service. When you arrive in GRU, expect delays and chaos !!! We had a connecting flight to Rio 2 hours later, and we barely made it because

Ha ha ha. (This phantom assistance did not happen)  Basically they just wanted to get rid of us.  They did offer us coffee coupons (!) at a coffee shop miles down the airport concourse. It was a pretty poor effort on their part. The best suggestion from one of the gate personnel  (although it would not have worked due to the timeline) was to quote ""take the train to Madrid instead"" . Well :) we have used the trains extensively in Spain - we think they are far superior to Seville Iberia and if we have the choice again we are most definitely taking the train! I encourage you to do the same.",May 2023,"June 10, 2023",1.0,,,,,,,,
Lost luggage,Naples,Fuerteventura,Europe,"Short story: my luggage went completely missing! It never arrived at my destination, and this was 3 months ago. 

Long story: Within the first 3 weeks after my luggage went missing, I contacted IBERIA several times and every time they told me they had no info whatsoever on the suitcase. They don't even know whether it ever left my departure airport, whether it did and was sent somewhere else....nothing! This was a suitcase I was forced to leave behind after I stepped on the airplane. I had entered the plane and a flight attendant literally pushed me out. At that moment we were standing at the top the stairs they use to get people on and off the plane. We are in authorised-only area, not at the check-in desk in a busy airport....here a company worker took the luggage, put a label on it and supposedly put in under the plane...easy, right?! Where can it goes from there?! Well, apparently to unknown mysterious places! After 3 weeks of waiting I used a Spanish association of lawyers* that deals with these kind of issues (it is a free service and you pay them a percentage only if they win for you), to make a claim for me. IBERIA even had the guts to refuse the refund. The association is now moving the case forward in front of a judge.

This was only my second time flying with IBERIA. The first time many years ago my luggage was delayed. It is not ideal but I understand these kind of things might happen...Unfortunately, what happened 3 months ago is on a completely different level and since then, if I meet someone who has flown with IBERIA, they always have similar stories to share (experiences clearly supported from the numerous reviews on here!)! I really don't understand how this is possible...I have been travelling for decades, the majority of times with so-called ""budget airlines"" but nothing like this ever happened, not even close. On the other hand, apparently, it is totally ok for IBERIA to loose other people belongings on a systematic basis.

Needless to say, I am never flying again with IBERIA, let alone suggest anyone to use them for their travel.

*Tripadvisor doesn't allow me to put the link of the association. I am not sure why, since I am not merely advertising it but providing a useful info very much related to this review. Nevertheless, if you google ""reclamador de vuelos"" you should find a few that provide similar services.",February 2023,"June 10, 2023",1.0,,,,1.0,1.0,,1.0,
Truly awful experience from customer service and check in.,Madrid,New York City,International,"DO NOT FLY IBERIA AIRLINES! 
 We (2 people) booked our flight and seats in February. We paid $85 per seat to sit in row 21 which is the first row in economy. We did early boarding on the Iberia app 24 hours before we left. When we arrived at Madrid airport (4 hours before departure) to check in our luggage, we were told that our seats in row 21 were no longer available and even worse, we were separated. We managed to be seated together in row 39 and Iberia told us to get our refund for the $85 seats online. Nobody knew why our seats were assigned to another passenger- they just did it. I spoke to several other passengers and the same had happened to them. 
As I am writing this review, the plane is boarding for the last half hour and there is no AC.

She became argumentative and disrespectful.  My wheel chair airport assistant, Mr. Hugo Christiano tried to explain to her that was not possible and to be customer friendly with me. She began arguing with him as well.  He requested to speak to her supervisor to get her name, but the supervisor refused to answer his request.  My rollator was eventually checked in but it was damaged before she received it with by suitcase.  It was scratched and missing parts.  I am requesting the price of this rollator be reimbursed to me and an apology from the female employee.  During the rest of the flight to my destination, the service was excellent from all the other employees except for this lady at the Frankfurt Airport Iberia check in department. This took place on the 3rd of March when checking in of my flight above.  This rollator was purchased by me in Germany. Upon arrival to Puerto Rico, I discovered that it was damaged. I tried to make a claim for reimbursement for damages but unbeknownst to me, I only had a window of 72 hours to make the claim.  It took me a total of almost 17 hours to arrive to my destination.

They have been holding onto my luggage in Dallas for a week, plenty of messages were sent by agents when I called (supposedly), an agent from American airline as well, Unfortunately No answer.   No straight or definite and honest answer whatsoever.

Horrible,Paris,Madrid,Europe,"There was not one good thing about this experience. Check in counter had employees just sitting there while the line for check in grew for 30 minutes. They finally started taking customers 2 hours before flight time on an international flight. The poor people at the end of the line would have been lucky to check in an hour ahead of the flight and still had to go through security.

The shuttle to the plane was packed and they would not let people out of the stuffy shuttle to board for 10 minutes. 

The most surprising part was there was no offer of water or drinks on the flight. It was a two hour flight and the cart went by but only stopped for a couple people who paid for a coke or cup of water.

I felt safe, however, because I had an Optimal ticket that allowed changes. 
I made a change to February 2023, outbound with Iberia, return operated by American Airlines. Again, they take 72 hrs to send the confirmation. I received AA’s, but not the outbound confirmation. 
When I called customer service, my reservation was under someone else’s name. When they located it under the ticket number, they said that I had improperly missed my flight and that the ticket was lost. 
I insisted and called several more times. Finally, one agent said that yes, I could make changes and that I should book a new reservation to fly before the ticket’s anniversary date. If those dates were not convenient, I could cancel and rebook to extend my “voucher” for a year. 
I called the next week with my dates following her advice. I was told the ticket belonged to FOUR other passengers and that my ticket was not valid.

Once I arrived in Santiago, my luggage was lost and I had to wait until the following day for it to be returned to me.

To make matters worse, the flight back from Santiago to Berlin was operated by LATAM, and I was not informed during the buying process that I would not be able to select a seat until I arrived at the airport. As a result, I was unable to secure a window seat or any seat with extra legroom. Despite contacting Iberia to inquire about purchasing an upgrade, the plane was full and I was unable to obtain any additional space.

In short, if you are considering purchasing a ticket through Iberia that will be operated by LATAM, be aware that you may lose all the benefits of selecting a decent seat or even upgrading your seat after purchase.

Beware of Iberia - A Frustrating Experience with Double Charges and Poor Customer Service,Minneapolis,Madison,Domestic,"Dear readers,

I am writing this review to share my experience with Iberia in hopes of saving others from the nightmare I have endured. I am not one to write reviews, but after what I have been through, I feel compelled to share my story.

I booked a business class ticket with Iberia for a holiday trip to my home country. At first, I was overjoyed to find such a good deal. However, my joy quickly turned to frustration when I discovered that I had been double charged for the same flight. I contacted Iberia, and they claimed it was a mistake from their end. Despite this, fixing the issue proved to be a daunting task. Every time I called them, I received different responses, and the problem persisted.

Eventually, I contacted my bank to dispute the transaction, and only then did Iberia respond. They canceled both of my tickets, even though the mistake was theirs, and they provided fraudulent data to my bank. They claimed both charges were legitimate, despite providing proof that the tickets were suspended.

After making numerous phone calls to Iberia, I was told that the flight might be canceled. However, if I did not ask, I would not have received a refund. I was also informed that the two tickets were valid and non-refundable, which was not the case. It is unacceptable for a large airline like Iberia to charge a customer for two non-existent tickets.

To make matters worse, I am still waiting for a resolution to my problem. It has been a never-ending cycle of claims, phone calls, and false promises. I was originally supposed to receive an email about my claim, but after a week and four phone calls, I was informed that Iberia does not send emails about claims.

In conclusion, I strongly advise against booking flights with Iberia. The airline may seem appealing, but it is not worth the risk. They do not value their customers, and their service is appalling. I am a middle-class person who saves up all year to afford a business class ticket, and Iberia's mistake has caused me unnecessary stress and anxiety. Spare yourself the trouble and book your flights with another airline.",February 2023,"May 2, 2023",1.0,,,,,,,,
Go for better airline,New York City,Barcelona,International,"I'd avoid this airline. I had tickets for trip in 2020 to Barcelona but Covid happened and they gave us credits of the same value for future use. I thought this was better than some domestic airlines (ie Frontier) where they gave us silly miles (that you're not able to use for many flights) instead and then didn't even do that on some flights ! Back to Iberia, I was hoping for good service when we used these credits for a new trip booked for April 2023. Our flight was schedule for late evening, after 11PM overnight to Barcelona from JFK. We got to the airport, checked in and were at the gate. Unfortunately my wife got her tooth cracked and from previous dentist visit this seemed like she'd likely need a root canal procedure, she was in pain. We called her dentist and they advised not to fly for 9 hours as that would aggrevate the pain even more - cabin pressure and such. We called Iberia and they tried to screw us by giving us an option to buy new tickets for this trip in the next few weeks that would require us to put out of pocket double the value of original credits, basically price went up 3 times ! This was nuts and we didn't take it and they refused to give us credits. Well, we went back home from the airport digusted with airline. Still, next day after my wife saw the dentist and got the doctors note I tried to open a ticket with Iberia to at least get our credits back. They refused. I then followed up again asking for reasons to refuse as they responded with very generic message, and got another generic refusal.

Quick refund,Madrid,Bogota,International,"I fly with Iberia quite frequently and was very pleased with a recent customer service interaction. I needed to cancel and get a refund on a long haul flight which was dealt with quickly and I received my refund in less than a week. 

The one piece of advice is Iberia do not clearly advertise the customer’s ability to cancel within 24 hours to receive a refund (+30€ fee). 

Initially CS advised I could cancel just one flight in the round journey and the refund would be processed in the form of an Iberia voucher.  I called back CS to confirm, to be told by a different operator, that I had to cancel both flights in the return journey and would receive the refund back into my bank account with a fee of € 30. 

In general I was happy with the solution and CS experience but advise Iberia to have 1 clear policy on refunds. Had I not called back to confirm it may have been a different situation. 

Another piece of advise for customers is to ask for your case number while on the phone with CS so you can track your refund.",May 2023,"May 1, 2023",4.0,,,,,,,,

They then inform us they cannot send the luggage to our hotel but only to the nearest airport. The airport is 1.5 hours away each way. In any case they don't send it there, but rather to an airport 4 hours away where they then want us to go get it. In the end the luggage is lost for 6 days before getting to the right airport (our vacation was three weeks). This meant that we lost our trip into Bolivia as we had to stay put and didn't have sleeping bags etc. On the return flight the plane is then delayed which means we miss the connection for a total of almost 9 hours delay. During both cases we receive no service/information from Iberia about anything on either email or phone. Only because we ask for it in the airport do we get a meal to eat during our long stay in Madrid.

This is the first time I have used Iberia as part of a British Airways connecting flight and the customer service is haphazard, discriminatory and unprofessional. 

Iberia have refused to make any reasonable adjustments for my travel. I call the customer service line they tell me to apply using there online forms. When I complete the online forms, Iberia then send me an email advising that they can’t process my request and to call the customer service team. This has happened on 3 separate occasions and I’m fed up of being sent around in circles. I’m emotionally drained from trying to arrange something so simple that has been made problematic by the airline.  I would never use Iberia to travel again as their staff have no training on dealing with special assistance customers. They need to understand that it’s not a goodwill gesture to make reasonable adjustments, it’s a legal requirement.

The seats were worn out and extremely uncomfortable and the pitch and leg room were akin to a puddle jumper designed for a one hour flight.   The temp ranged from freezing cold to ultra hot, seldom in between, and there was no air vent to mitigate the freezing air flow.  The """"food"" was like 3rd grade cafeteria food and inedible.  The  flight crew did the bare minimum, literally tossing your ""breakfast "" boxes at us.  Not once did they come around to offer water, towels, snacks, etc beyond the basic service. Indifference would be how I'd describe it. Oh, and the flight was over an hour late because their computer system was messed up and many were given the wrong seats. Basic Seats that you must pay extra for to get , by the way.  Worse, there was ZERO communication from the gate agent, who appeared totally out her element and could solve nothing.   I could go on.  One or two of these issues could be attributed to ""that's life"", but the whole package suggests  an airline that at no level cares about their customers.  Simply the worst.",April 2023,"April 14, 2023",1.0,,,,,,,,
Lost / delayed luggage twice in a week!,Madrid,London,Europe,"Honestly one of the worst customer services, very disappointing especially for such a big European airline. I flew from London to Madrid, and back to London, a few days later, and my luggage was lost both times. It was a carry on luggage which they forced me to put as a hold, and then decided to deliver the luggage two days later, with later flights.

Twice - in one week. 

Even more so, I just had Iberia change my flight from
Bologna back to Madrid, for the upcoming May bank

Iberia Lost Luggage Disaster Service,Malaga,Toulouse,Europe,"When checking my larger bag, I was told that I need to check my rolling handbag as well, because the flight was very full.....which I did not want to do because it contained my valuables that I NEVER check.  But I did so because the check-in counter stated that I am priority, with priority stickers put on my bag and all will be fine.  I arrived in Toulouse and no bags!  Then I created a baggage missing claim, and got a tracer number for both bags.  24 hours later I recieved two text messages that Bag #1 was found and on a flight (gave the flight number) from Madrid to Toulouse, and second text message was the same for Bag #2 (my rolling hand luggage).  Delivery came with only the first large bag and no information on second bag.  I have tried several calls for days with the Tracer Company, the Airports, and Iberia Airlines.  Nobody can give me the same answer...still being tracked, airport not received bag, Iberia has no information.  I have lost more than 1200 Euros of items (contact lenses 6x, prescription glasses, jewelry, gifts...and even the Bag was new).  In my pleading for someone to assist, I have been told that I need to stop calling and wait 21 days to file a claim.  What kind of service is this?

Be Careful With Your Connecting Flights at Barajas Airport and Allow for Extra Time.,New York City,Malaga,International,"For this review, class of service is irrelevant.  We often take Iberia flights to Malaga, Jerez or Alicante that require making connections at Madrid's Barajas Airport, and until last year (April 20, 2022), we had been very lucky.  For starters, our takeoff from JFK was delayed for 45 minutes. That left us less than an hour to clear immigration control at Barajas (which was short-staffed and jammed with passengers) and race to the far end of a terminal to catch the connecting flight to Malaga, only to have the boarding gate closed on us. Since that episode, we now err on the side of caution and allow a least two or three hours to take a later connecting flight, which is not necessarily the one recommended by Iberia. Once cleared through immigration at Barajas, we then spend the hiatus in an airport lounge until the connecting flight is ready. No more mad dashes for us!  Other than that one episode, we've been very happy with Iberia and consider it to be mostly superior to AA and Delta for flying to Spain.",May 2022,"April 11, 2023",5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0

"This airline is a complete scam, do not book with them!",Tampa,London,International,"My wife and I booked flights from Tampa to Gatwick. My wife booked through travel agency on Iberia, flight operated by British Airways. I booked directly with Iberia, but my flight is 1 week later.

When my wife tried to check in she found out that the flight is cancelled. We called BA and they confirmed that flight is not cancelled and will be on time. Iberia claimed that they see the flight is cancelled, and we need to speak with our travel agency. After some back and forth with travel agency customer service, they rebooked my wife on the same BA flight with $75 reinstatement fee. At this point we were so frustrated that we didn't even argue about the fee.

Now 1 week later, I am checking in for my flight to find out that it is also cancelled. However, I booked directly with Iberia so I figured it would be a simpler rebooking process. After calling Iberia 5 times and speaking with 4 different customer service agents, they all told me that flight is cancelled and there is no other availability. I argueed and pleaded and nothing worked. I went to BA website and booked myself the same roundtrip flights, but of course paid twice what I paid originally to Iberia. 

Now for part 2. I called Iberia to ask for my refund and they tell me they cannot issue refund of this flight, only a voucher. Needless to say that I lost it at this point. But yelling at customer service is useless, they are basically cannon fodder. The ""supervisor"" is supposed to be available in 2 hours so I am calling back. 

Here's 2 items from Iberia's bill of Passenger Rights for cancelled flights

1. Compensation can be paid in cash, by electronic bank transfer, bank orders or bank cheques or, with the signed agreement of the passenger, in travel vouchers and/or other services.

2. 300 euros for all flights not included in the points above, when the re-routing offered has an arrival time at the destination of no more than four hours after the one initially scheduled on the reserved flight; or 600 euros ¡f the delay is more than four hours.

Appaling service. Appaling customer service,Rome,London,Europe,"This was our first experience of flying with Iberia. We chose the airline as their schedule best suited our needs.

We had hoped that for our transit time, we would enjoy glasses of Cava on the way to our departure gate. I was looking forward to it.

This is what happened...

The flight was about an hour late leaving Rome. We finally arrived at Madrid, late. We looked everywhere for Iberia staff at Customer Services. There were no staff there at all. No one.

After some time I found one member of Iberia staff at another departure gate. She was busy scrolling on her mobile phone. I asked her for help. She looked up, said ""no"" and went back to her cell phone!

As we proceeded through the terminal, we finally found departures screens and saw that our flight to Heathrow and closed. We took the connection to S gates, hoping to get on the next flight to LHR.

The two women at the gate there, boarding a 16.20 flight to LHR, told us to go to Customer Services (near gate 39)

When we got there we found a long line of people who had also missed fights and one member of customer service staff. A long wait began. Eventually we were seen and told that the next available flight was the following morning. She would make arrangements for overnight accommodation and transfers.

Iberia booked a mini bus, one mini bus for about 80 people, all without flights, now camped out on the street. The driver arrived three times while we waited. Each time he would take 8 people. 'Capacity'.

We waited at Madrid airport for 3 hours in total, at Customer Services and for the shuttle bus. Iberia finally got a coach for everyone which arrived just before 7 pm. We were all taken to the airport 'suites' which felt more like a hostel than a hotel. There was a buffet dinner. We ate something, then retreated to our rooms.

In over 45 years of air travel I have never missed a connecting flight until that day.

What an awful experience.

The next day we have to be ready for 05.30, to be taken back to the airport on a coach, for the 07.40 flight to London Heathrow.

At 12 30 the crew says that we cannot go because of some problem about the French airspace we need to wait 1.5 hour more.

Pleasant flight from Madrid to Helsinki,Madrid,Helsinki,Europe,"Finnair uses Iberia planes on its daily flights to Madrid and Barcelona. The service concept is completely Iberia.

We bought economy class tickets and upgraded them with Finnair points. The return price was 210 euros plus 20000 points.

Iberia packs even more passengers into its A321 than Finnair does. Iberia has 220 seats and Finnair has 209 seats. In business class, the middle seats are blocked away. Besides the front toilet, Iberia has only two rear toilets, Finnair has three.

The front cabin has got one row more by removing the tiny closet Finnair is having and moving the front wall forward so that it is partially on the side of the exit. The first row has quite the same legroom as Finnair has. Rows 2-10 have probably less.

In Madrid, Finnair business class passengers are not allowed to use the fast-track security. The lounge access is included. The Dali Iberia lounge is very spacious and excellent in service.

There was a group boarding. For row 1, it is advisable to be among the first ones inside the plane, because the overhead bins over 1AC are reserved for other stuff and you cannot have anything down during the takeoff and landing.

There was quite a lot of turbulence after the takeoff and it took a long time before the service was started. There were no hot towels before the drink service but a printed menu with two warm options was given before the food service. The food service was a complete three-course meal, no chocolate cookies as a dessert as Finnair serves.

The front galley is smaller and some of the drinks had to be fetched from the rear galley. Wines are served in 18,75 cl bottles but spirits are poured next to the seat from big bottles. Finnair uses miniature bottles.

The service was friendly and attentive. The flight landed 3 minutes behind the schedule in Helsinki. Our priority luggage was not among the first ones. In Helsinki, the luggage comes usually in random order.",March 2023,"March 19, 2023",5.0,4.0,4.0,,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0

How do they stay in business with horrible customer service and robbing people?,Los Angeles,Barcelona,International,"I purchased a ticket on Sept. 7, 2022 through Iberia Airlines, a roundtrip flight from LAX to Barcelona. The reservation outbound flight was for April 5, 2023, but I cannot locate any other information for the flight. There is no record in my email inbox. 

A customer service agent, Andrés, told me that if I did not have a reservation number that there was nothing he could do. When I inquired whom I may contact for information or for a refund if need be, he told me that I would not be able to, and raised his voice with me. I told him thank you and hung up. This is rather shocking customer service, yet I cannot believe that there is no recourse.

When the deadline came closer, no info... when we asked, the Iberia staff started getting angry at us (the customer who pays their wages)... after the deadline, we would have to wait for about 30 min and then... we would get more info... but we didn't... and then another 30min... and so on... until at 15h the plane could finally take off. 
We of course missed our connecting flight in Madrid to Brussels. We had the impression (can be wrong of course) the staff their tried to handle it ""the easy way out"". No option to take any of the 2 remaining flights to Brussels. But I seriously doubt if it was checked. They made up a story about us staying in a very nice hotel etc (you have to know: we were travelling with our kids of 8 and 10 years old).

Pleasant and affordable flights to Granada,Madrid,Granada,Domestic,"We booked return Basic tickets from Madrid to Granada counting on that we as Finnair Gold members will get checked-in luggage without an extra charge. The price was just 69 euros per person.

We also got advance seat selection, priority security and lounge access in Madrid, boarding group 1, and priority check-in in Granada. 

The check-in in Madrid was a little bit confusing. All domestic flights are checked in at desks 850-859 but we couldn't find a priority desk. So we had to print the baggage tag by ourselves and take the bag to the check-in desk. 

We already had our boarding passes printed at home because we got them emailed directly after we bought our tickets three months ago and chose our seats. Now we got new boarding passes from the check-in machine.

In Granada, the check-in was more clear. There were two desks, one priority and one normal.

Both flights were operated by Air Nostrum and Mitsubishi CRJ1000 (ex-Bombardier) jets. This aircraft has seats 2+2. However, the cabin is quite cramped. The overhead bins are small. So during boarding, big hand luggage is collected away next to the steps of the plane. When arrived at the destination, the luggage is brought back next to the steps.

There was no service in the economy class. The two stewardesses concentrated on the service of business class. On longer flights, there are drinks and food for purchase.

The flight time was just 45 minutes. Our return flight landed 15 minutes behind the schedule because of the late arrival in Granada.

Worst Airline Customer Service I Have Ever Experienced,Canton of Geneva,Miami,International,"I have travelled my entire life and been on most of the airlines around the world . Iberia is by far the worst customer service I have ever experienced . No one at the airline (both on the phone and at the airport ) cares if you make your flights. I was flying from Geneva to Miami via Madrid. The day before my flight departure Iberia changed my first flight from Geneva to Madrid so I only had a 55 minute layover. I immediately called and asked to be put on another flight as I knew the connection was tight and any little delay would cause me to miss my connection to Miami. I stressed how important it was for me to make it back to Miami on Saturday for work on Sunday . The representative refused to do anything and said she was texting her supervisor and he said no. I asked to speak to the supervisor and she said no. I then asked how much it was to change if I were to pay out of pocket and she hung up on me. Then of course the next day at the airport my first flight is delayed 25 minutes leaving me with a 30 minute connection. Keep in mind I also have to go through passport control. The attendants at the gate would not help me and said I had to “figure it out in Madrid”. I also called customer support and they said there was nothing they could do and would not put me on another flight . Horrible experience! Oh I almost forgot, on the way over they lost my bag for almost 48 hours which I did not complain about at all or request any money for even though I had to buy things out of pocket because I didn’t have my bag.

After the check in they gave me a voucher worth 8 Fr. and everyone knows how expensive the zurich airport is. With 8 Fr. you can barely buy a water. When I finally entered the plane someone was sitting on my chair and I had to go to the team and ask them to find me a new seat. I am shocked how rude and unorganized Iberia is.

Poor customer care and safety,Buenos Aires,London,International,"I flew return to Buenos Aires via Madrid and on my outgoing flight my luggage was lost. It took two weeks to locate and return my luggage to me (I received it the day before my return flight). As I was visiting Antarctica I had to purchase a number of essential items to enable me to continue with my trip. Looking at the terms and conditions of Iberia lost luggage - it looks almost impossible to get any compensation! Trying to use their website is a nightmare and customer care services are very unhelpful.
My in flight experience for all the flights, but particularly the Madrid to London flight was unimpressive. There were 4 stewards serving 12 passengers in business and we were rushed through our lunch service, whilst they all huddled behind a curtain chatting and eating. The WC was closed off to passengers to prevent them for going behind the curtained area. On at least two occasions the cockpit door was left open four a period of time with nobody guarding access. On boarding the plane, no group numbers were used resulting in all passengers being loaded into buses together. This resulted is small babies and children being loaded towards the end. Parents had to struggle with pushchairs etc., with lots of people rushing to try and get on the plane. At first nobody guarded the end of the wing, and passengers were able to walk freely below as they accessed the front and back doors of the plane.

"$5,000+ to change basic economy tickets",Jacksonville,Madrid,International,"I had to change my family's outbound flights because my children's passports did not come back in time. I called in advance and spoke with their customer service.  Their agent told me to ask for an exception through their website. So I entered it and requested help.  Iberia sent a message back telling me to call the Customer Contact Center, and they would help me change the flights.

Message as follows...

 ""Thank you for contacting us.

We have read your communications with regards to your next trip with.

Please contact, via telephone, your Iberia Contact Center where the will more than happy to help you.

Best regards,
 
Customer Relations""

So I called again, and the Iberia customer service agent told me there would be a penalty to make the change... I said OK, this is fine.  And said, I would need to pay the fare difference.  I said OK, fine also.  And then he said he would check on the difference.  And put me on hold  for one hour.

I was on hold for so long I was concerned no one was on the line.  

So I called in from a second phone and started speaking with a second customer service agent.  While doing so, the first agent hung up on me.  

I explained the situation again to the second agent.  She gave me the information on the changed flights I was requesting.  Said the penalty to make each change is $199 per ticket, so total of $796 for four passengers. I said OK. And $25 each for a service charge, $100, again OK.  

Then she said the total I had to pay for each basic economy ticket  (which is the cheapest ticket they have) would be $5024.  For a total of $20,096, yes USD $20,096 to change all four tickets.  

I could not believe what I was hearing. The most expensive business class ticket is $4,886 on Iberia.com.  For the dates I wanted, Iberia.com showed all four tickets totaled $2,959.  With penalties, $3,855.  And that is without subtracting what I had already paid. 

INSANE!!!  She then explained to me Iberia.com's prices are for first time purchases and are special online rates... and they do not count for changing your flight.  I could not believe it.  I just laughed.... they wanted me to pay them $20,096 + the money I had already spent, to change our flights!  What alternate universe is this airline operating in?

With such an outlandish and outrageous claim, I can only expect this customer service is a reflection of the condition of their flight operations and personnel... not good.

Average airline with great punctuality and price,Madrid,San Juan,International,"Airline reviews are always the least objective.
They're mostly written by two groups of travelers.
First are travelers who had any kind of misfortune - their luggage lost, flight delayed or missed, etc... Not being in a position much more to do they write a review due to stress (and money lost) they encountered and that review becomes their exhaust valve. And, I understand them. But, such bad and unpleasant things can happen on any flight on any airline. So, take these reviews with a great reserve to judge an airline.
Second group are travelers who still think that flying (specially national carriers) should be a 5 star hotel experience. That's a long gone era. Low cost carriers forced major airlines to lower the prices which resulted in service scrap. So, change your attitude - as a traveler in the ""cattle"" economy class you should observe your experience as a transportation from point A to point B safely. Don't expect feasts onboard except you're flying Business of First class, but that's times 3 or 4.
Third group of reviewers/travelers is the largest one, but almost non existent here.
Those are travelers who made their journey successfully without issues and they consider it normal, without a need to write a review about it.

We had 4 flights with Iberia in December 22 and January 23.
Two European on A320 Zurich - Madrid and back, and two intercontinental on A332 Madrid - San Juan and back.
We bought our tickets in April and for the return journey Zurich-Madrid-San Juan and back paid a bargain price of 500 Euros pp (luggage included).
On European flights there's nothing included, even water's paying.
But, it's a 2 hours flight - what do you need for that ??? Still if you do, you can buy sandwiches on board or take them with you beforehand.
On intercontinental flights a meal and a snack was served like in any other European flag carrier. It does not differ from any other I flew with recently - Air France, KLM, Lufthansa....
Meal is hot with a choice of mainly chicken or pasta with salad, cheese and cake. Complimentary soft drinks, beer or wine and coffee. Snack is a kind of sandwich.
What more you need ? It's not a feast, but a fair meal to keep you fed.

Each of 4 those flights arrived before scheduled time at destination despite being little late at departure. Later, I've read somewhere Iberia has among the world's best punctuality rating.

Baggage nightmare - are they incompetent workers or very good thieves at this point?,Manchester,Marseille,Europe,"Already posted a review for this trip, just completing the story since update. I travelled to Marseille (France) from Manchester (UK) through a connection in Madrid. First flight delayed, and my boarding pass was only available an hour after the opening of check in and bag drop off desks... Madrid flight leaves on time close to 10PM. I was told my baggage delayed when I arrived in Marseille... a delay that lasted over 2 months... I kept on calling and going in person to airports but everyone pointed fingers at each other, leading me to go around in circles, looking for a luggage THAT WAS NOT EVEN REGISTERED IN THE SYSTEM.  
I was told this was probably because the tags might have come off the bag during transportation therefore couldn't be scanned, and enter the tracking system. After the 21 day mark I claimed a compensation for the expenses it costed and the value of my luggage. I usually keep all my receipts and online purchases invoices. I was able to provide proof for over £2,500 worth of belonging in between presents, cosmetics, jewellery,  winter clothing, and the extra cost of baggage handling. Iberia took the longest time to review my emails I had to call them to check them while on the line because my messages were getting 'lost in mail'. This can sound very pushy but I am student living on my own and I was missing most of my winter clothing, and basic hygiene products in times of 0 degrees Celsius, and £2,500 short on money. 
Finally Iberia decided to compensate the amount of £1,340, independently from the search of the bag, which they declared to be the highest amount they could refund me. I asked why they just said that was all they could refund. 
On the same day, a friend went to Madrid airport to ask about the luggage which still didn't appear on tracking system. When my friend described the bag they declared having sent it back to the U.K. Weird since they are meant to scan a luggage to send it, right? I don't know what they are taught to do in baggage handling, but I am pretty sure when you send something over, specially in an international flight, for obvious security reasons, you have to put a label and scan a bag. But apparently not they just sent a 'similarly described' bag back to the UK but they could not confirm to which airport. I call Iberia about this. It's not on the tracking system. 
2 weeks later I decided to go to Manchester myself. I guessed it was the airport of departure so the logical thing would have been to send it back there. I had to wait over 2 hours for staff to tell me they did not have the bag and that my case showed as closed. I asked how that could be and they said that it could only be done if the bag was declared found, which it clearly wasn't. Out of curiosity I asked whether that was something only Iberia could do, and yes. Meaning Iberia stopped the search of my bag after they refund barely half of its content value without notifying me. 
I later call Iberia to ask about this and the lady very rudely told me that since i had been compensated they closed the case. When I reminded her that it was meant to be independent from the refund she got worked up and told me off and that was ridiculous. I told her that I didn't just assume this information, I was told on the phone before accepting to go forward with the compensation, and that considering she had the same name and voice as the woman who said it, she was the same one. She denied specifying this to me although I remember asking her to make sure I wouldn't be screwed this exact way...
I leave it at that, I can't ask for more compensation, I have lost most of my winter clothing, and underwear, that I will have to replace. I have no information on my luggage, and their poor administration and handling abilities ruined Christmas holidays with family. 
On Friday the 17th I receive a call from London Heathrow Airport saying they have found a bag at my name and it corresponded the description, I go there to pick it up and turns out it had all the tag and little extra stickers for all my flights, and the one stating they sent it back to the U.K. via American Airlines. 
So either Iberia and luggage handling company has deplorably unskilled workers, or I almost got scammed off £1,500 and 23kg of belonging. I obviously don't think this was purposely done to steal the baggage but nevertheless, Iberia staff has be one of the most incompetent at baggage handling and communication I have ever experienced. Like I said in my previous review, I'll avoid it at all costs.

Fist and last time flying Iberia,Los Angeles,Barcelona,International,"The worst service I’ve ever experienced as a seasoned traveler. To be honest the “service” was non existent. Not one crew member even acknowledged us during our 12 hour flight. Not even a greeting or goodbye when boarding or leaving.  Honestly all the flight attendants looked annoyed to even be there.

Bring snacks and drinks because there is absolutely no beverage service and the food offered via pamphlets looked very unappealing.Bathrooms were dirty and gross.

Their website and app are also faulty often giving error messages that leave you anxiously wondering if anything has changed.

Not So Bad (Possibly ?),Buenos Aires,London,International,"Reasonably priced  one way ticket at GBP850 (ITA cheaper). On time, clean new Airbus with comfortable seat .

Welcome aboard initially like warm which quickly dropped to almost rude for 5 of the 6 disinterested cabin crew serving economy 'customers '.

No aperitif bar service (Good Ol BA) so straight in to the absolutely frantically almost thrown out meal service as all 6 crew converged with trolleys and trays without any need to actually engage in rapport with the people they 'serve '. 

Beef and boiled pots, green bean salad with tiny roll , nasty chic brownie stone, no cheese and crackers (BA).  Orange juice and nice red wine. 

One staff worked with courtesy and smiles which I appreciated.

Thats it...it you want anything in next 5 hours we are in the galley checking our phones until we emerge with a quick ( nice) sandwich service with water or juice.

Lavatories dirty by 5 hours and left to be left to get worse with no paper tissues and soiling . Yuk!

My Unfiltered Experience: Why I Will Never Fly with Iberia Again,Malaga,New York City,International,"If you're considering booking a flight with Iberia airlines, think twice before doing so. In my recent experience, I found the airline's service to be nothing short of disappointing. My luggage was lost, and the process for handling the situation was downright pathetic.

What's worse is that their customer service agents were incredibly rude, making it clear that advocating for myself was an inconvenience to them. As a customer, I expect to be treated with respect and professionalism, and I certainly didn't receive that from Iberia.

From the very beginning, it was clear that the airline was not on top of things. They had the description of my suitcase wrong, and despite my attempts to correct it, the system was unable to make the necessary changes. Instead, all they could do was add a note, which didn't help in the slightest.

I've traveled to over 50 countries and have never experienced anything remotely as precarious as my experience with Iberia. It's a shame that an airline with such a poor level of service exists.

Setting a new standard for HORRIBLE service. Congrats Iberia.,Madrid,Marrakech,International,"My apologies, this is lengthy...

After  an uneventful 2 flights to Madrid on other airlines we had one last flight to Marrakech on Iberia. We stood at the gate until departure time with no updates and at that point we were told the flight was delayed and expect an update in 2 hrs. The flight ended up leaving 3 hrs late and none of our bags arrived with us at our destination. We were forced to delay our plans out of Marrakech while waiting for our lost bags. At no point did Iberia offer an apology or compensation to purchase essentials while we waited. We also purchased upgraded seating on the flight and when we boarded our seats were occupied and we were moved a row forward from our original seats. Shortly after boarding the flight attendant came to us and said we needed to be moved out of upgraded seating to the back due to weight and balance issues. The people in our original seats were not moved and,later, other people were actually moved and re-seated in those seats? Apparently not weight and balance issues.

Fast forward to our flights home 2 weeks later. When we arrived home in Portland one of our 3 bags did not arrive for our transfer in DFW.  Customer service in DFW seems to have no clue how to handle this and simply gave all of us a confusing internal form to fill out that was obviously meant to be filled out by a customer service employee. After completing the form as best we could we gave it back to the agent and requested a tracking number... she said that was not possible. Fine, off we go to run for our connecting flight. The next day I call and the agent has difficulty tracking the bag because we did not have a lost baggage referral number. Eventually they find it using the original baggage claim number and said it was to arrive at our final destination late that night. The next day I call Iberia again to confirm it had arrived and had the oddest, and most disappointing, experience with the customer service agent. I gave her the same baggage claim number after explaining we had no lost baggage referral number because Iberia did not issue one when we filed the claim. The claim number was now somehow in another name and the agent accused me of lying, saying that was not my claim ticket it belonged to someone else. I offered to email her a picture of the claim ticket with my name on it and the number but she refused. She again forcefully said this was definitely NOT my luggage claim ticket. I had hit a frustrating dead end, and simply gave up. Later in the day I go to my local airport and the bag was indeed there... with a rush tag on it and with the exact claim number I had offered.    

Ok, so stuff happens and i'm really pretty easy going. Was it inconvenient to wait for 
 bags and reschedule a tour out of Marrakech at the beginning of our trip? Yes, but it wasn't the end of the world.  My biggest issue is at NO point through any of this did Iberia show any concern or offer even the simplest apology for  our inconvenience.

Multiple challenges and poor customer service,Barcelona,Boston,International,"I had a flight from Madrid to Boston via Barcelona, booked with Level but operated by Iberia. First, my trip was cancelled but I received no notification until the moment I tried to do the check-in. I tried to receive support from Iberia / Vueling / Level and they all acted like children that were fighting each other and blaming the other company for not knowing how to do the right thing. Meanwhile, I found myself in the middle of this childish discussion with no one taking responsability. I finally managed to get help, and the only alternative I receive from Level is to fly THREE DAYS LATER on a transcontinental flight (or a refund that obviously solves nothing if I want to buy a ticket from Spain to the US on the same day). Completely outrageous.

I then try to get compensation for the expenses I needed to incur during those 3 extra days while I was waiting to fly, and then again neither Level nor Iberia want to take responsability. To clarify, it was Iberia who should take responsability given they were operating the flight.

If this was not enough, Iberia lost my luggage and did not return it until 3 days adfter my arrival to Boston. AND the only reason I got it back was because I insisted and went unrequestedly to the airport, where I found my bag in the room where they keep the lost bags. They had not even bothered to call me.

Worst thing is that they give no guidelines whatsoever about what you can buy during the days when they leave you with nothing; the only guidelines I received from a staff in the airport is 'don't worry about expenses, they'll need to cover'. I buy the basics I need, clothing, basic hygine products... and once I try to receive compensation, Iberia concludes that they will only refund 20% of the total expenses I incurred during the 3 days, which included a return trip to the airport (25% of what they refunded).

And I am not even talking about all the time I had to spend in making the claims, talking to customer service...

Ticket change hidden costs,Madison,Lyon,International,"Back in Nov'22, I booked a flight from MAD to LYS for my son, my wife and myself in March'23, for a total of 790,12 Euros. We chose the comfort fare for the first leg and the optima one for the second leg. Unfortunately, due to unforseen reasons, we are not going to be able to travel to Lyons in March. Knowing that flights cannot be cancelled, rather than loosing our ticktes we decided to fly to FUE in June instead and assume the fare overcost plus the penalty fee for the optima fare (45 Euros / person, supposeddly first change is free with the comfort fare). The price for the tickets to FUE are 870,29. Therefore we were expecting a 80,17 Euros charge for the extra cost of the ticket plus the cancellation fee asociated to the optima fare. In total, we were expecting to pay 215.15 for the tickets change. But when I call to Iberia customer service to request a change, to my surprise, they tell me that the price associated to a ticket change is not the same as brand new purchase and the change price cost per person is going to be 221 Euros. Bottom line, they are asking us to pay 663 Euros in addition to what we already paid (a total of 1453,12) for ticket that are only worth 870,29. They are lying to you when the tell you that the comfort fare has not change fees (if you request at least 15 days earlier that the schedule departure) and the optima fare has a 45 Euros cost. Liars.

EU airlines are unfortunately bad in general, but Iberia deserves the award of the worst company in the world (and I have been traveling for more than 30 years). Here is our story, hoping this will help people chose another company (don't make the same mistake as us, even if flying with another one takes longer) So I've had two major issues within one single trip, not to mention the angry, unfriendly staff on the plane who is reluctant to even bring a glass of water during an 8h flight (be warned you better buy your own food and drinks before). 1. First Iberia staff offered a rebooking for a cheaper price and asked to call me back, but they never did and I had to rebook myself for a much higher price. Now they avoid their responsibilities, as they sent us through their so called online customer service and we received nothing but evasive answers. Be ready to waste hours of your time and ofc they will always reply on the wrong way (talking about entry regulations or foreign country documentation which has absolutely nothing to do with my problem), and of course they sent this poor answer from a ""donotreply"" email. In other words, they kindly tell you to go f**k yourself. 2. When we finally arrived at destination with 2 days of delay, all of our luggage was lost. We had to purchase all basic goods and when I sent the receipts they are now ""happy to inform"" us that they will refund ... but offer only 10% of what we had to spend because of them (also be aware they make it very hard for you as their form is absolutely not user friendly, they do willingly limit your possibility to explain the problem and they restrain attached documents). Again their answer lack any explanation and it is sent from a ""noreply"" address. People said we were unlucky, but reading all the comments here I realize that it's the opposite : you have to be VERY VERY lucky to travel with Iberia without problems.

"Discrimination, Dishonesty and Unprofessionalism",Madrid,New York City,International,"I recently experienced blatant discrimination and dishonesty on my most recent flight from Madrid to New York with Iberia Airlines. Here’s my experience:

I had an economy seat on board IB6251 from MAD to JFK on 18 January 2023. I was seated in 21A, which was directly behind the Premium Economy section. I noticed that Premium Economy had several seats available after general boarding had concluded. So, I asked a flight attendant if I could relocate to a Premium Economy seat and he replied, “No. It is not possible. This is our policy.” I was surprised and confused by his response because earlier I watched a couple that was seated in the same row as me ask him to relocate to Premium Economy and he immediately accommodated their request.

After I returned to my seat, I watched during the next 5-10 minutes as several passengers - couples, singles, a parent and child - being escorted from Economy and re-seated in Premium Economy. These were the same passengers who I saw earlier boarding the aircraft and were seated behind me in Economy.

Here’s my point of contention:  If there is a “policy”, as referenced by this flight attendant, that prohibits passengers from upgrading a class once on board the aircraft, then this policy should apply to all passengers. This flight attendant was remarkably dishonest! How is it that for me such a move was not possible per “policy”, but for at least 7-9 other passengers an upgrade was not only permissible, but encouraged? To whom is this area “off-limits”? Americans? People of color? Folks wearing all black? A black man wearing all black? What was the difference between me and those passengers who were afforded an upgrade? 

Glean from my experience what you will. I, however, am calling a spade a spade - This attendant’s actions were despicable, discriminatory, dishonorable, and unprofessional! And ain’t nothin’ more sinister than racism served with a smile!!",January 2023,"January 19, 2023",1.0,,,,,,,,

Iberia Sucks  worst worldwide,Bogota,Frankfurt,International,"Iberia is the worst airline I have had the opportunity to travel with. There are far more cheaper airlines  that are more competent of providing a proper services than Iberia let me share with you  my travelling nightmare experience. When you go on vacations it is a time to renew yourself physically and mentally. Not a time to spend hours fighting with  an Airline in order for them to deliver your travel bags to your home or destination.

I flew to Bogota, Colombia  mid December using Iberia. I have travelled to this destination in the past  through different  airlines in past years having no trouble what so ever. This time it was a complete nightmare since when we (my wife and I) arrived to our destination, our travel bags had been left in Madrid. We originally flew from Frankfurt with overlay in Madrid. At the counter for the bag drop they explicitly told us that our luggage would automatically reach the final destination. Once we arrived to Bogota Iberia workers explained to us that our luggage was left in Madrid and that after filling a report it would be delivered to our home. 

The next night the Iberia worker called and said our luggage would be delivered on the next morning. The day after we decided to call Iberias contact center, where they said that they could basically see the same information  that was displayed in the tracking site on the Iberia webpage to us, and for further resolution we would haver to call directly a number in spain (+34) 90011342.  I asked if Iberia would cover the outbound call: answer (NO). I called the number only to find out that nobody picked up since it was out of services. After 3 days  we called again to complain only to receive the answer that if we needed to buy something (like a toothbrush iberia would pay the cost for basic need items). So on the fourth date we decided to go to the airport in Bogota to Iberias offices  where the person who had called us in the first date told us that according to her tracking the luggage was already delivered. This was completely false and after she contacted the delivery service a (cab/Taxi) They said they would deliver it in the next 40mins. It was the only way to get our luggage for our vacation trip.

We flew 2 days ago back to Frankfurt with the same itinerary  from Bogota with overlay in Madrid to finally reach Frankfurt also with Iberia. airlines. The plane that took us from Madrid to Frankfurt looked more like a charter plain than a real commercial airplane i don't think it had more than 40 seats(maybe to safe up cost). I did not feel safe in this airplane at all. To my surprise when we arrived to Frankfurt our luggage did not arrive and even more surprisingly it was not only me but 7 or 8 other customers who had flown directly from Latin American countries and had there connecting flight in Madrid. It was as it the small charter plane was to small to fit all luggage to fly to Frankfurt. Two days have passed since I have arrived  home and had to buy toiletries just to look decent when I go to work since, my luggage has not arrived and have not even been notified of the status or whereabouts of my personal belongings. I would never recommend anyone I know to use this airline, it is the worst airline in the world. At the airport I requested for an e-mail or an address where I could sent a written complaint this was not provided since you can only contact them through phone.

Dishonesty through and through,Sao Paulo,London,International,"We flew Premium Economy with iberia (Booked through BA) from São Paulo to london Heathrow with a five hour lay over at Madrid airport. When we arrived at london and were finally reunited with our luggage it was plain to see it had been ransacked by someone on the way back.  The straps on the outside were missing, the zipper extender section around the case open and the internal case zipper open and everything rummaged. 
Only that customs stopped us on our return, and many more I hasten to add that day, that we found out at the airport that this it a had been done.  We were also shown how easy someone can enter a zipped suitcase with a biro pen, even if the zippers are locked together. Never travelling with a zipped case again. 
I had a little chuckle though as only our dirty washing in my case, all the nice stuff was in my wife’s hard shell case!! 
Not to add there was no choice of vegetarian or gluten free and the breakfast was absolutely diabolical - a cold cheese and ham sandwich, not what I would expect in Premium Economy!!

Three of us received boarding passes through to Lisbon, one did not.  Despite our questions, they could not explain why.  As a result, this caused us to miss our connecting flight in Madrid because our friend could not get through the check point without a boarding pass.  When we asked how to re-book, the woman at the counter simply waived us down the airport terminal and said she didn't do that.  When we finally figured out where to re-book, there was a long line of people who missed their flights.   Only two workers for about 100 people.  Terrible service.  When we finally made it to Lisbon, two group members were without luggage.   Again, we had to wait a couple of hours to file a claim.  One person's luggage arrived 36 hours later and another person's luggage 40 hours later.  His luggage had been ransacked.  Above all else, their attitude is the worst.

Baggage Disaster,London,Alicante,Europe,"Iberia is a logistical sh!tshow of an airline. Unfortunately if you want to go to Spain, you will likely have to experience their incompetence firsthand. I booked with American Airlines from Charlotte NC USA to Alicante Spain with connecting flights through London Heathrow and Madrid. American partnered with Iberia for the London to Madrid and Madrid to Alicante legs. In London the gate assignment for an 11:25 departure wasn't posted to the boards until 11:10. This was problematic as depending on where you are in Heathtrow, it can be up to a 30 minute walk between gates. It turned out the departure time of the flight was also delayed but never reflected on the boards. After arriving late into Alicante, we waited on the aircraft another 40 minutes at the gate because, as the flight crew explained, there wasn't anyone available to extend the jet bridge or block the aircraft wheels. Was our arrival a surprise? With the late arrival, deplaning delay, and distance between the gates in Madrid, I missed the flight to Alicante by mere minutes. The misadventure begins. I waited 30 minutes in line at the Iberia service desk to be told there were no more flights to Alicante and I would need to stay overnight in Madrid. I decided to take the 2.5 hour train ride from Madrid to Alicante instead of staying overnight. No offer by Iberia to reimburse me for this 65 Euro additional cost. I asked about my bag and was told by the Iberia desk upstairs that since I missed the flight, I would need to collect my bag in Madrid by going downstairs to carousel 6. After 45 minutes of watching new bags dribble in and existing bags go around the carousel with no sighting of my own bag, I stood in line another 30 minutes for the Iberia downstairs service desk to be told that my bag had actually gone on to Alicante without me (apparently my bag traversed the Madrid airport faster than I did and actually made the flight) and I would need to collect it at the Alicante airport. Off I go on the trains from Madrid airport finally arriving in Alicante at 9:30 pm apparently far too late in the evening to get any assistance from Iberia on picking up a bag at the Alicante airport. Ok. I’ll just go back to the airport and collect my bag in the morning so off to my hotel in Benidorm. Next morning at Alicante airport, Iberia baggage service representative keys my information into her computer and tells me not only is my bag not available for pickup but her system doesn't even show I have a bag. I feel like I'm trapped in an episode of Little Britain where “Computer says no.” Next I need to complete a form (blank sheet of paper where I wrote my name, email address,  phone number, and local address…feels very official) so they can search for my bag. I'm told I should call twice a day to check the status of the search. I call later in the day to be told my search profile is incomplete and they need my email address, phone number, and local address. It seems the official form, i.e. blank paper I wrote on, from earlier in the day didn't make it all the way through to their system.  Summation: I arrived on Wednesday and it is now Saturday but still no bag. Conclusion: Iberia airline is a logistical sh!tshow. The end?",January 2023,"January 14, 2023",1.0,,,,,,,,
Worse airline to fly business in,Madrid,Montevideo,International,"Don’t waste your money flying Business in Iberia. Their service is minimal and they treat you like you’re a nuisance to them.

They said yes it was possible but they would need to rearrange our seats. In the end we didn’t get the cot (they said it wasn’t for such old babies but then why did they say yes when I called?!) and my husband and I were seated far away from each other - they were not accommodating or sympathetic at all. They didn’t even greet my toddler (she’s sociable and quite calm) or acknowledge our existence.

I might as well have flushed $1000 down the toilet.,Indianapolis,Madrid,International,"I went on Kayak.  They suggested an itinerary that worked for me, and directed me to the Iberia website to book the trip.  I chose the upgraded flexible no-change fee option, booked and paid at the Iberia website, and received confirmation and an itinerary from them.

Upon examination, the itinerary I received was not what I thought I'd bought, including an impossible self transfer between Kennedy and Laguardia.  I logged into Iberia to use my flexible option and

WAS TOLD IBERIA WASN'T THE BOOKING AGENT, I would have to contact the booking agent directly.  WHAT?

I tried to contact Kayak.  That was an utter nightmare worthy of a separate review, but the upshot is that Kayak is not a booking agent OR a ""third party"", they just assemble the itinerary.

I then contacted American, which flies the first leg of the itinerary.  They assured me they are not the booking agent, Iberia is, but for a $50 fee changed the problem flights.

Upon further review, I realized that the layovers on the remaining flights are really too short and get me into Madrid too early.  And guess what.  Even though Iberia has a much better flight leaving a few hours later, they won't change my ticket because they're not the booking agent. Kayak won't help me because they're not the booking agent.   And American wants $2000 extra (plus another $50) to put me on a flight that costs the same as the one I have.

So. I've spent a total of 32 hours fifteen minutes online, or on hold, or speaking with people who can't help me.  I've paid for a flexible ticket I can't change, priority boarding on a flight I'm not taking, a seat upgrade on another flight I'm not taking, and checked luggage I never needed to check, it was part of the ""flexible"" package.  I've paid an extra $50 to fix a problem I shouldn't have had, and can't change the other leg of the flight unless I want to mortgage my car.  I can't even confirm that i have the seat I wanted, so for all this I may be up all night in a miserable seat AND arriving in the middle of my night.  I also have no idea who to check in with or whether any of my seat reservations are still in effect.

We had a 40 minutes delay in Vienna, so that meant the connection time was affected. The flight from MAD -JFK was smooth, crew was good, food was okay , flight arrived 30 minutes earlier in JFK.

Upon arrival,  terminal 8 JFK carousel  4, is where we were directed to find our bags. This is where my nightmare started.

 First time time traveler with Iberia, last time for sure. I would rather walk or swim than fly this airline. 

Here is why!

It’s 2 weeks plus now and my suitcase is still missing.  I filed a claim at JFK before leaving the airport. Missing baggage happens every now and then even with other airlines. What sets those other airlines and Iberia apart is the CUSTOMER SERVICE!. 

It’s one thing to have your luggage missing and getting someone on the other side who is dedicated to helping you and its a another thing to have a luggage missing and get someone who is dedicated to frustrate you. The latter is Iberia. 

The baggage service center agents are rude, not informed and the good part they terminate the call if you have questions! 

The social media team —- only good at copy pasting links! Links if you know how to find out more information about company process on their website are easily available.

Nobody has information at Iberia! 

Just today, I spoke to an agent —- mark you, have called every single day and it’s the first time someone said—- we found a match for your bag tag on Dec 11th but there is no further information. If there was a match, why am I still not with my bag 2 weeks later? 

He also went ahead to tell me, you can declare the bag lost and we will stop looking! I have to declare my bag lost while I entrusted you and paid you  (Iberia) to safely transport it?

To  the next traveler, if you can avoid booking Iberia, please do, If there is another option —- take it. if there is no other option, only do carry ons.Save  yourself from this nightmare. 
  
My biggest mistake was not reading the reviews beforehand. I would have changed my itinerary even in the shortest span because every story about missing luggage is true.  

You would rather incur a higher cost of changing itinerary than incur the cost of dealing with Iberia when they lose/misplace your luggage.

He declined to accept it and directed us to their customer service desk at the end of the airport, to stand in another line. He also said we could come back and jump the line instead of waiting in line again (I’ll come back to this in a minute). Iberia customer service said we did in fact pay and there should not have been any problems. So, off we go back to the check-in desk. I waited near his check-in desk as he ignored all my attempts to gain his attention. Then this lame agent has amnesia and doesn’t recall our conversation to come back. After a heated discussion of back and forth he agreed to help us after three more customers. He then tells he still doesn’t see payment for the luggage.

"Horrible airline, horrible seats, horrible customer service",Madrid,Santiago,International,"We had bought premium economy tickets with 8 months anticipation. During check in we realized the plane didn't have premium economy. So we were seated in row 45 in horrible seats with no legroom at all due to a home entertainment box that was put in front of the seat it was even impossible to put our legs just straight in front of us, on a 13 hour flight, a complete nightmare. We have used Iberia in the past, and never had such tiny leg room spaces, that means, they must have introduced more rows in the aiplanes to make more money. Obviously we complained already at Madrid Airport,  the ground personnel told us not to worry, that we just needed to file an online complaint and Iberia would pay us back our money. The online complaint form is made in a way that you don't have any copy of what you sent , you can only do screen shots which will never show the whole information of your complaint. We received a response email telling us that we had to call customer service for this to be solved. On the phone, they promised us that we would be refunded of the difference between Premium economy and economy. About a week later we actually received a refund, for half the ticket price, and checking our booking realized that Iberia had canceled our return flight and left us stranded in Chile. Customer service on the phone told us that we have been refunded and would have to buy a return ticket because our current one did not exist any more. So we had to pay an extra 1000 eur more that the refunded amount to buy new return flights. A nightmare.  Iberia since gave us the silent treatment.

At the Iberia counter for lost luggage (the biggest one I ever saw at an airport) there was a long line of other people waiting, so I lost a lot of time and arrived at my hotel nearly at 1 am. Had to leave my hotel at 8:15 am for work, so I had to wear again the clothes I wore while flying in. Hoped my luggages would arrive one day later, but nothing. 
Phoned the number in Spain, where they told me my luggage had been identified/ left behind in Francfort, but they had no further information, when they could send it. When I explained I really needed to know how long all this would take, the lady just hung up on me.
Being back in France I tried to call their service phone number - it's not free in France, they even make you pay for phoning them! After five minutes with prerecorded messages (if xx press 1, if yy press 2 etc), in the end there even was nobody I could speak to. At the German service phone number I reached somebody. They keep telling me since 5 days now that my luggage was found, but that they had no further information. I should wait. 
At Worldtracer they say the search for my luggage is still under way. When I read all the bad experiences told here I begin to wonder, if the service people just tell me lies in order to calm me.

Do not EVER USE THEM SHODDY AND RUDE,Madrid,Sao Paulo,International,"I flew from London to sao paulo to visit family for Christmas. I got to Heathrow Airport and it was CHAOS. No one being checked in, some people getting to the front of the queue to be told rudely to queue in another line and all yje while panic setting in as take off tome approached. Around 70 min before departure they finally started to accept bags, but by the time I finally was able to drop my bags and get up to security, my name (together with others in the same situation)( was being called. Was escorted through security and to the gate by very helpful security staff. Flight was then delayed due to this issue and arrived into Madrid around 40 min late which gave less than an hour for the layover to Sao Paulo. Ran to make the commenting flight. Arrived  at GRU to discover that whilst I made the flight yhe bags didn't. Xmas presents and food, medication , as well as all my clothes and toiletries are now missing. Staff at GRU were rude and unhelpful and with no apology ot help at all gave me a form to fill out. No apology, no idea from staff as to when I might get my bag, and no sense at all that anyone gave a toss. For context there were around 80 other people on that flight whose bags had gone astray which suggests that the Irline simply took a commercial decision to not wait for bags from layover flights and let their passengers suffer. Furthermore this is the 4th time I have used IB on thi route and the 3rd time they have lost my bags. Noone there cares. As it is, my kids will likely be without Christmas gifts, I have only the clothes I stand up in and important medication that I can't take in my hand luggage for security reasons I am now without.

A disaster- beware!,Naples,Toulouse,Europe,"Where do I start? I'll keep it brief. Flew from Naples to Toulouse via Madrid, flights were ok I would say a good, budget airline standard. Transit in Madrid was a joke, they gave us 60 minutes and we arrived about 5 mins early, so far so good. Arrive T2 and we had to transfer to T3, Saw a sign saying 20 minutes transfer time so we bolted, rushed through security, made the next shuttle (it was packed but we pushed in as the doors closed on us) ran through the huge T3 and made our closed gate 5 mins before departure and thankfully they let us on. We had a dream run- do NOT accept a connection with Iberia at Madrid under 90 minutes, be warned. The worst was to come, arrived Toulouse with my wife's bag only, spent 1 hr logging a lost bag and then our holiday turned to crap. Iberia said it would arrive on the next flight, nothing. Day 2 we are told it would arrive, again nothing. Day 3 in same clothes nothing from Iberia. Emailed them, no reply, rang number as directed and told by abrupt operator : sorry sir you bag had not been found yet so I cannot advise when you will get it back. Now desperate and not sure If I will ever see bag again, check Iberia website and it states they will cover up to 1.100 euros for lost luggage so a I had to attend a wedding the next day went and bought some replacement clothes, neat casual only not the expensive suit in my luggage. Bag finally arrived at 5.00pm on day 5. Have put in a claim with Iberia and heard nothing.. Went online with our case number and found out it was ""closed"", nobody told us.

Who's On First?,Vigo,Tangier,International,"First warning: If you are transferring with Iberia and you have under 90 minutes for the transfer, I would advise against buying the ticket.

Second warning: If you fly Iberia you need trip insurance. If you are transferring through Madrid there's a pretty significant chance they may misplace your luggage. This has happened to me twice in the past year. The first time it took two days to retrieve the luggage. On this second occasion it has taken over 5, with no end in sight. While Iberia reimburses travelers for some expenses relating to not having baggage, they don't reimburse everything.
Finally, there's some kind of gap between customer service and the lost baggage department. Talking to customer service is like talking to the wind. There is no mechanism for them to reach out to the airport where your misplaced baggage is sitting and ask someone to put it on the next flight. Same with the ground crew.

Felt Cheated For The Upgrade from Economy To Business,Madrid,London,Europe,"I booked a flight fromMadrid to London on Economy
Before the flight, I wanted to add a luggage, when I Checked in on-line, I was offered an upgrade to business class, I checked the allowance for business class, it was stated at 2 pieces. For safety sake, before I make payment for upgrade, I tried to add luggage. but the website did not allow it. Seems like it is set for 2 pieces right?....WRONG

At the airport, I was served by the worst ground staff ever, when I showed my luggages, she just said pay 60 Euro, I said I am in Business Class, She just said ""You Upgrade, only 1 piece"", I said ""I tried to add on-line but I could not"", she ignored the statement, and just asked ""How you pay?"", as if telling me that I have no choice if I want to fly. I felt digusted at being tricked by the airline and the treatment of the ground crew.
Upon reaching the plane, I was shocked that there is no actual Business Class seat, instead it was just a normal economy seat with an empty seat between the passangers. Imagine... across the width it was 3 seats left and 3 Seats right, but on the flight it was ""1 passanger + emplty Seat +1 passanger and 1 passanger + emplty Seat +1 passanger"".
The airline website misleadingly showed as ""2 Seats left and 2 Seats Right"", so whoever booked Business Class will not get the wider seat or the extra leg-space (only those in the first row).
Adding insult to injury is that the cabin crew used the lugage space meant for the passanger to put their hand luggage, thus making me go back 5 rows to retrieve my luaggage when the plane landed.

I came from Asia, where they rated some of the worst airlines, and I even took some of them, but I never felt as cheated or mistreated as a passanger of Iberia Air.

A Very Different Perspective,Madrid,New York City,International,"My wife and I flew Premium Economy from Madrid to JFK two days ago and thought our flight was quite good. The negative comments that I am reading do not reflect our experience. The aircraft was a new Airbus 350, Our premium economy seats were comfortable with a comparatively generous recline angle. The main meal was pretty good for airline food, with very decent wines, and the landing snack, a Spanish ham bocadillo, was tasty. The flight attendants were attentive, the bathrooms were kept clean, and departure and arrival were punctual. My only criticism relates to seat selection for which there is a charge (that seems ungenerous when a premium is being paid for Premium Economy seats) and, moreover,  the seats we chose were not reflected in our reservations, though  we did manage to sit together.

The 12hr flight was gruelling, they cram everyone in so tightly, the bathrooms were in terrible condition from a couple of hours in and the staff were unfriendly. Both me and my husband are vegan and we had opted for vegan food when we bought our tickets. On the flight, they had no vegan options for us for the first meal, they just gave us the side salad and a tiny bread roll and nothing else. For the second meal they gave us one vegan portion between us and told us we had to share. It was half a (soggy) sandwich and a small pot of fruit.
Once we landed in London we went to claim our baggage but it did not arrive. We were told to wait for the next Iberia flight as our luggage might show up. We ended up waiting for 3hrs for our luggage and it did not arrive, several other passengers were in the same situation. We then filled in a form and were told that when our luggage arrives it will be posted to us. No information came from Iberia on where our luggage was or when we will receive it.

On this flight, I again tried repeatedly to page the flight attendant to purchase food as we slept through meal service and no one woke us. I was again ignored. This time I got up and went to find someone, and I was shouted at by the flight attendant to return to my seat (the seatbelt light was on, but many others were milling about and I had tried repeatedly to get assistance at my seat).  Then that same flight attendant was giving other people snacks and drinks, after shouting at me! 

I was appalled. I always go out of my way to be courteous and kind to flight crew and I have never ever been treated this way.

NEVER AGAIN,Miami,Porto,International,"For our last two to three trips, we have used Iberia to go to Madrid or Barcelona and all of them have been regular trips, the trip this year was for April but due to office issues we had to cancel (2couples) and we were given 4 vouchers to use within a year. We planned our trip to star September 21 ending October 16 with flights Miami-Madrid-Porto and Madrid-Miami. To be of the four of us close to each other, mainly because both our wives have mobility problems, in July 28 I bought the seats for all of our trips, two days before the initiation of our trip I received an email saying that the seats for our wives were changed, I called Iberia and they were able to put us together again in different rows, I asked the Iberia operator to please link our 4 reservations so that  any change to one of us will affect all of us, he told me that was not possible but I remember that in one of our previous trips with Iberia it was the  Iberia operator who offered that option. The following day when we could print our boarding passes, I proceeded to do so and when I finished, I noticed that our wives seats from Miami to Madrid were changed (we, men kept the original seats) Called Iberia again and they told me “once you printed the boarding passes, we cannot do anything” but the operator told me to go early to the airport to see if they could do something for us, we did so and after long time and thanks to the patience  of the Iberia lady, we were placed one couple in front of the other, originally we had left side seats row 25 and 26 and we got right hand side seats row 35 and 36. When the doors closed and we started our flight there were SEVERALVACANT seats, WAS THE CHANGE OF OUR SEATS REALLY NEEDED?. Two days before coming back from Madrid again I received an email saying that the seats for our wives were changed because of plane change, I called Iberia and I was able to get back their original seats, once we boarded the plane I noticed that there was NO PLANE CHANGE, this had the same plan I used to choose our seats 2 seats next to the left window, 4 seats in the center and 2 seats next to the right window, they moved us just because they wanted, because they do with you whatever they want.

Business class flight was disappointing and not on par with competition,Madrid,Dallas,International,"The flight was not ""horrible"" or the ""worst ever"" as some say but it was not very pleasant and not on par with the competition.  

The flight took a ""fueling delay"" at the start.  This caused me to miss a connecting flight and have to for a night in a hotel at DFW.

On boarding I was separated from traveling companion with no recourse for a nine hour flight.  The aircraft interior was an old design and worn but seat functions worked OK.  The headsets were cheap and uncomfortable in contrast to those on other airlines which have nice noise cancelling headsets.

The food was very disappointing.   Very poor quality, overcooked, dried out, etc.  I had pasta and the pasta tube ends were brown and hard.   This food and its presentation was poor compared to most coach meals.  They ran out of water bottles mid-flight.  The ""snacks"" that are supposed to be in the galley were very meager and not rally edible.  Breakfast offering was pasta, seriously?  It looked like catering might have shorted them and the crew was doing the best that they could but no explanation was offered.

On arrival I waited over an hour for my bag.  It is an ordinary duffel of modest size, certainly not an ""oversize bag"" but they delivered it to the oversize luggage belt.

Overall this experience was one that will lead me to avoid this airline for future travel.",November 2022,"November 13, 2022",2.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0

The first two times that my flight time was changed, did not really bother me because the change times were not significant. But the third time, not only was the time changed significantly, but the airline was also changed. I complained about it and I explained that I had other connecting travels that will be affected. They were rude and hung up on me. They refuse to refund me or put me on a more suitable time that will not affect my other bookings.

Complain,London,Madrid,Europe,"I went to the Boarding Gate at 18.05pm to board the plane as normal there was 2 Former colleagues at the desk, 1 lady particular asked for me to wear a mask, I responded I didn't have one to hand could you please provide me with one as previously I travelled with the same airline Iberia which they provided me with on 11/10/2022. The Lady said we can’t provide a mask and wouldn't let me board the plane without one which was very frustrating as the staff themselves wasn’t wearing a mask.  I then ran to boots quickly to Buy a mask as I was very worried I wouldn't make the flight as time was going on. I eventually got my mask and came back to the Desk the same lady Rudely said she is not letting me on the plane as she accused me of telling her to f.off which wasn’t the case, she then became very aggressive and tried taking my passport and boarding pass and tried to take a picture of my ID documents with her personal phone and invading my personal space. She also tried taking my mobile phone thinking I was recording her when I was on the phone to contact customer services but she thought I was making a video of her. Which I have evidence of me calling the customer service 4 times. 

I felt very upset as she came across like she was discriminating me and causing problems what wasn’t necessary I tried to reason with the lady she then called security which wasn’t needed I felt very upset as I myself is a professional business man and this trip was very important to me. The security/Police came which I was happy to corporate with them. They  had a look at my mobile phone and confirmed I was not taking no recording of the lady what she accused me of. The police took me to one side and asked me to apologise to the lady which I was happy to do even though I wasn’t in the wrong I went over to the lady and apologised if she thought I was being rude in any time of way. She didn’t take my apology and said say she will not let me board this plane as you can imagine at this point it becoming like she is taking this to a personal level and made me feel very upset and uncomfortable like I have done something terribly wrong I’m a reasonable guy and I like to smile a lot and this is my personality she made out I’m laughing at her which was also a lie. I boarded a flight with my partner the previous week and I had no problems at all so why now am I feel like this is discriminating me maybe because of my Race I don’t know. She didn’t want to reason with me and told me I will not board this plane I find this very painful as I have never in my life had any other problem with no other airlines and as I use Iberia a lot I didn’t expect this at all from a large company with yourself.

I was then refused to board the plane and couldn’t even get the next flight as she declined that also which wasn’t her duty to action this. I now have lost out on 1. Business meeting and 2. Money I have paid for this flight. Also, money I purchased a return flight for the 20th of October flight number 3180 at 16.50pm.

I would appreciate if you could look into this for me as I will be taking this further if this doesn’t get resolved I will also be contacting the metropolitan Police for my complaint. 

I look forward to your reply.

Where's the logic?,San Francisco,Madrid,International,"I obtained an Iberia Visa card through Chase.  Apparently, there was a mix up because I had an older Avios number, or there were two different emails for me on file.  I was never sure what the exact problem was.  Chase instructed me to go to the Avios website and change my email address.  I was not able to do that.  I called Iberia Avios and they instructed me to send a secure email.  I received a response back that they needed a copy of my Passport.  I sent them a copy of my Passport.  They replied that it was an incorrect number on the passport.  I ended up having to call Iberia Avios on a regular line (for which I was charged $57 in international calling by phone service).

DO NOT BOOK WITH IBERIA! THEY MAKE FRONTIER AND SPIRIT AIRLINES LOOK GOOD.,Barcelona,Chicago,International,"The debris of a Chinese rocket on 11/4/22 caused Spain to close their skies for 30min just when we were boarding our 1st out of 3 flights home from Barcelona Spain to Denver USA. Because of that the flight got delayed by 1.5hours and we (along with our entire plane) missed the connecting flight from Madrid Spain back to USA. The agent in Barcelona did not tell the group why the flight was delayed. Iberia does not communicate anything with their customers, at the gate, nor on the plane, nor through any of their staff. Once we landed in Madrid we all went to the nearest information kiosk to get new tickets. The line grew, then staff came to take us to a different information kiosk in a restricted area. People were panicking at this point as the realization set in that none of use were getting out of Madrid that day even though it was around 1130 am. A lady even had a panic attack and required a medic.  Over 600 people were in the line for new tickets and only TWO IBERIA AGENTS WERE WORKING. They had no rush and were so slow. We were towards the front of the line and it took us 6 HOURS to get to the counter. We tried calling the iberia airline number and they told us that they don't have change fees but would have to pay the fare difference for a new ticket which would have been $800 USD per person. Even though the flight delay was not our fault. So we decided to stay in the line. Some people contacted their own companies and just bought new tickets for their destination, as the line was not moving. People began to get desperate and angry and began to cut which lead to fights. We were in a secured area of the Madrid airport so we could not leave to get food or water. Mother's with children were in the line. Iberia staff were rude and threatened to not help many people in line who were getting upset or even said ""if you don't stop yelling see if we will ever get you out of here!"" At one point the boss came and said ""everything will be ok, just stay in the line we will help you in no time"" however we waiting 3 more hours after that. The agents would finish their shift and leave, or would get angry and disappear for periods of time, there was no rush at all to help anyone. By the time we got to the front a huge fight broke and the ""guarda civil"" or the police came. My husband was filming all the choas on his phone and instead of the police demanding order within the crowd, they came to my husband and yelled at him to stop filming them and demanded his passport and told him to go with them. They threatened to prosecute him or not allow him back in the country if he posted the video. It was the most frustrating moment of my life. We finally got new tickets (mostly because around hour 3 we called costco travel and they helped us but still had to stay in the line to get our new boarding passes) and the iberia agent gave us a hotel voucher. We had to take a bus to the hotel and once we were there realized that hotel was housing Ukrainian refugee women with their babies. The whole thing was odd and strange, but we were grateful for a bed. We slept 3 hours (after being in the Madrid airport for 18hrs) and then took the bus back to catch our flight out of Spain. Never in my life have I seen such chaos, disorganization, sheer incompetence, lack of communication and respect from an airline company. I will never fly Iberia again, and neither should you. If your flight is delayed, or you miss a connection, etc good luck getting anyone on their team to give you any customer service.

Their customer service is not open at this time to confirm. (Closes at 3pm EST, so you are on your own in circumstances like this.) Iberia's customer service had no idea of this about this delay.

Canceled a leg of our flight last minute,Oviedo,Madrid,Domestic,"We had a multi-leg ticket with Iberia. Our return home was Asturias, Spain to Chicago with a connection in Madrid. The Asturias to Madrid flight suddenly disappeared the night before the flight. I called to let them know that we needed to be in Madrid for our connection. I told them this was all on the same itinerary. There was some excuse about us not showing up for one of our connections. I explained that they had re-routed us due to a flight delay and they should be able to see it on the itinerary. I told them that we needed to get to Madrid and for the flight home but they hung up on me. I stayed up for hours frantically trying to find a way to get to Madrid for the flight home. I looked at bus routes, reached out to United (which was a codeshare for us domestically in the US), and my credit card company and, shockingly, United came through with a flight. They said that they could see that Iberia had cancelled our ticket and that the flight was full but they could get us on a different flight. It was obvious that they bumped us after over-selling but instead of compensating us they decided to find an excuse to drop us. After getting home I called to get my seat costs refunded and they wouldn't even do that despite me telling them that I had paid for seat selection on the flight I was dropped from and the new flight. It didn't make sense that I should be charged for seats for a flight I never took. Had I not looked up the flight to check-in online and United hadn't come through, the situation would have been much more serious for us. I don't know that I will be able to avoid Iberia if visiting Spain or Morocco but I am going to avoid them if I have any other choices available to me.

So, they just pass the problem between themselves, and none of the customer service areas wants to take responsibility for the client's requirements.

Worst airlines ! Avoid,Barcelona,Los Angeles,International,We travel to Italy three times a year I was trying to find the most direct flight to Brindisi. There was a direct to Los Angeles to Barcelona from there we hopped on Ryanair from Barcelona to Brindisi. The price was great and I booked it on Iberia. I booked in April my flight left in September and returned in October. The App for Iberia was very non-user-friendly if you wanted to do any changing or exchanging of seats or upgrading. I did not realize that Iberia contracted out with LVL air lines and figured it out when LVL sent me a form to fill out for food request. The seats were the most uncomfortable seats. I am a woman 5’2” tall and I felt very cramped you can only imagine how uncomfortable My husband seat was. I spent extra money to purchase seats together row five on the way there and 5JNL on the way back I purchased the seats in April our flight was in September and return  October. The day we were to check in for a return flight it showed that I was in seat 36J and my husband could not check in to get a seat. We went to the airport the day before just to make sure that my husband was checked in properly and that our seat for it be what we paid for in row five. I was told by two ticket agents that they were not able to do anything for us since this was a level flight. They told us to contact level we tried to contact level I only got recordings and never spoke to a person at level and the recording said if we booked through Iberia or a travel agent we would need to do any changes through Iberia airlines. I explain this to both ticket agents . one sent me to a different  check-in line and finally the third ticket agent was able to at least check my husband in and seat us in row 25J and 25L together. They appesantitosi sold our seats to some other people and would not change their seats to the back . We were out of luck because the other couple checked in before us . Which is ridiculous since we purchased those seats back in April before anyone else .  they were not able to refund the money I spent on our original seats which were an upgrade. Now that I’m back I have to go through hoops to try and get my money back it is not going to be easy and Iberia keeps no records apparently I have all my records thank goodness but it’s going to be a disaster and I’ve wasted so much time already they can’t pay me the amount of time that I’ve spent trying to fix this mess that they created. The seats are extremely cramped the food is not good I would never fly this airlines again. My main goal was to have more of a direct flight and only one layover to get to Italy since I travel there three times a year. I will have to look for another way I will never ever travel on Iberia or Levelairlines again service is lacking. Worst booking service The agents and the flight attendants were very kind and nice but their hands seem to be tied I think the problem is with their corporate.

When Business Class is Not Business Claim,Tel Aviv,Madrid,International,"My wife and I recently had the misfortune of flying with Iberia Airlines.  To compound matters we flew business class (or their version thereof) which as far as I'm concerned was not money well spent.

On arriving at Tel Aviv Airport and on finally reaching the Business Class Lounge (the one we were initially directed to was closed) we were informed that the lounge had reached its maximum capacity and it was standing room only.

We had been informed by the Airline in advance to expect on the plane 2m flat beds and a gourmet food service.  No such thing.  The staff couldn't either muster up a pillow or blanket.    The passengers were routinely informed that this was a short haul flight (5 hours 20 mins) and we shouldn't expect such things (despite the airline saying otherwise).  Frankly the Cabin Crew service was nonexistent.

To compound matters on arrival the Airline lost the business class luggage.  No apology no nothing.  We were simply informed that the luggage would turn up eventually and be patient.  In their defence the luggage did materialize.  2 hours later.

We have subsequently tried to bring these shortcomings to Iberia's attention, but they just don't care.  We received an abrupt and very rude response in return saying that we should have expressed our grievances on debarkation of the flight.  Sorry but we couldn't as we was too busy trying to locate our luggage.

We are Gold / Silver Card members.  This is not the service we expect from One World affiliated airlines.  Sorry Iberia but you are light years behind Qatar, Cathay Pacific, Qantas etc...  in both service and attitude.",September 2022,"October 5, 2022",1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0

Beyond Terrible Airline - AVOID at all costs!!,Boston,Palma de Mallorca,International,"I haven't even flown yet on this airline, yet feel compelled to warn everyone about its bizarrely inept management.  I booked a round-trip ticket on Iberian's website from Boston to Mallorca a few days ago.  The final leg of the return was to be on its partner British Airways (BA) from London to Boston.

After booking the flight online, I called BA the next day to reserve an aisle seat. The BA rep told me that  a seat was 'temporarily' being held for me with a reservation code but that the ticket had not been confirmed and technically had not been issued.  He said I had to call Iberia and have them 'link the ticket' so that I could actually get on the BA flight.

Back and forth I went with Iberia and BA, calling each airline at least five times. This is what the two companies had in common:

  1. Neither Customer Service (CS) team was willing to contact the other airline to make sure I was properly ticketed.
   2. Neither CS rep would allow me to escalate the issue and speak to a supervisor or anyone higher

BA said I had to have Iberia fix the problem. Iberian reps all maintained that everything was perfect with my ticket.

So now I have a fully paid ticket, yet the 'partner airline' I am scheduled to fly home on states that I don't have a valid ticket with them. Obviously, this is a nightmare that I will have to deal with at Heathrow.

Even with boarding passes you can get bounced off a flight,Madrid,La Coruna,Domestic,"Atrocious experience and have lodged a complaint for i) terrible customer service of the ground staff, ii) the lack of a reason for denied boarding which is unacceptable and iii) the miscommunication of airline crew that gave us false assurance we would not miss our connection. We boarded IB3091 Porto-Madrid on 1/10/22, with a fly-through segment to A Coruna IB0512 later that morning. Boarding passes were issued for both segments at Porto and confirmation that our check-in bag would also be transferred. There was significant delay at Porto airport however which led to our delayed flight arriving in Madrid and despite being at the gate for IB0512 in time for final call, we were advised the system had bounced us off. We are now on a waiting list for the next flight to A Coruna, stranded at Madrid airport.
We anticipated a delay would make the connection challenging given lines at Porto aiport and spoke to numerous airline staff in Porto and while on the IB3091 flight, asking to be prioritised for disembarkation and next flight advised so our connection could be guaranteed - however were assured everytime that Iberia Airlines was aware and because we had boarding passes, this would not be an issue. This turned out to be false and untrue, and the lack of care and prioritisation is very disappointing from a global airline. We even received text messages acknowledging our spots on IB0512 flight up until 15 minutes of our arrival at the Madrid airport gate when we were then denied boarding - with no reason provided at all. The ground staff that we were redirected to at Madrid airport even threw our torn boarding passes back at us across the counter. 

If you ever find yourself in the same unfortunate situation, make sure to ask for some recompense and specify refreshments/meal vouchers, and accommodation allowance separately - I will give Iberia the benefit of the doubt and put it down to airline policy, but their credibility really went down the drain when they said there is nothing they could do, but ended up giving us meal vouchers when we asked.",October 2022,"October 1, 2022",1.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,1.0,,,1.0,

The whole time they told me that I am allowed to make expenses while my luggage is missing and that I will be reimbursed. It's been a month now since I failed the claim and the only response I got from them after calling 1000 times is that they will reimburse 121 British pounds while my expenses for essentials were 1000 British pounds. This is outrageous! I escalated the issue and still haven't provided a response. I am now looking for the best way to sue to escalate Iberia to the ombudsman service.

Avoid This Airline,Madrid,Lisbon,Europe,"My partner and I, who are American, flew from Santiago de Compostela to Lisbon on Iberia Air and had a terrible experience.  We had traveled from the U.S. with a carry on bag and a small daypack, to walk The Camino. Traveling back to Lisbon from Santiago we had to connect in Madrid.  While the flight from Santiago to Madrid was packed, we boarded the flight and stowed our carry-on in the overhead compartment without any issues. However, while boarding the leg from Madrid to Lisbon, as we showed our U.S. Passports, we were pulled aside and our carry-on bags were taken from us. The staff member said that the plane was smaller.  That was not true. It was a new Airbus with huge luggage compartments, and as the flight was perhaps 60% full, the compartments had lots of extra space beside bags that were the same size and in some cases larger than our own. If Iberia Customer Service would like to reach out, I have photos I can provide. We were the only people on the flight how had carry-on bags taken from us.

Denied boarding with no apologies,Marrakech,Madrid,International,"Well, the dysfunction by Iberia Airlines started when we tried to check in the previous night (August 29th 2022) at the hotel and we could not. The dysfunction became a nightmare when we arrived at the Marrakesh airport at 10:02am to check in for the first leg of our flight (flight # IB 3341) at 12:40pm. We were met by chaotic scenes at the check-in counter as two families were in line ahead of us. We joined the queue patiently, as we waited for our turn. After one hour of standing in line, the attendants at the kiosks opened two other lines and very selectively chose passengers behind us to go to those lines and be checked in. When I complained that we had been bypassed, I was met with a very rude comment of “why are you upset?” from the attendant in kiosk #11 at the check-in counter. When I pointed out the situation of standing in line for over one hour while others who just arrived at the airport were being serviced, she put on her jacket, took my daughter and my passports from me, plunked them down on the counter and left without saying another word!!

Possibly the worst airline I have ever travelled with,London,Marrakech,International,"Had no choice about using Iberia and this is a second retiurn trip with them. Travelling from UK to Morocco, transiting through Spain. At Iberia check in (Heathrow) we were made to pay £55 each for covid lateral flow tests despite having been immunised 3 times, had covid passports and the UK immunisations were recognised as EU equivalents. None of our other UK travelling companions were required to do this but we were told the Spanish government insisted. No such requirement existed for the return journey. My conclusion is that someone was illegally profiting from some travellers. 

On requesting tap water during the flight none was given. Attendants were charmless, inattentive and interested only in selling refreshments and chatting with themselves. Safety demonstrations were conducted such that they were not visible from wing span through to end of plane.  

On a previous trip. again while in transit at Madrid Airport, we asked an Iberia representative at a desk if they could point us in the direction of our gate. We were asked if we were disabled and if not they couldn’t help as this was a desk for disabled people.

Abuse to young people with autism,Madrid,Concord,International,"Abuse and mistreatment against autistic youth by Iberia and authorities at Barajas airport, Madrid, Spain.

On September 17, 2022, my son  had a flight back to the United States from La Coruna (Confirmation Code K512N) with a connection in Madrid to return to his country (USA); the flight was purchased from American Airlines (AA8569 and AA 8835).

When getting off the plane in Madrid, he forgot his passport on the plane seat, he immediately returned to pick it up and Iberia employees as well as security prevented him from doing so despite his pleas more in English than in Spanish, which apparently made him very bad humor to the airport officials, and as a consequence of this incredible attitude my son missed his flight to the United States, the Iberia employees made him report the loss of his passport to the police when the document was not lost, hours later they notified him of They had the document.

Autistic people tend to block themselves in unexpected situations and that is what happened. Instead of helping him, the Iberia employees mistreated him with his attitude, indifference and lack of empathy.

The family here as there in Spain was desperate, Iberia gave them a standby ticket for which they charged 200.00 euros for a situation that was entirely Iberia's fault and that could have been resolved in 10 minutes.

Advising that they had the passport, we immediately called, and an employee named Carmen yelled at me that they were not to blame, she did not offer us any help despite the fact that we told her that the young man was autistic and needed help, on the contrary. hung up the phone on us.

We were able to find him an accommodation 20 minutes from the airport and the next day they told him that he could not leave on the scheduled one because it was full, they sent him to Customer Service, there the employees refused to speak with him in English, which is the language he knows. , and they told him that he had to wait for the next flight, I was able to get him a ticket for the next day with American Airline, flight number 95 at 10:05 am. When Iberia saw that it had another flight, they canceled the one it already had. Looking for help, I called and managed to talk to Mr. Felix Juaranz, and after explaining the situation and trying to cover the company at all costs, he told me to tell my son to go to post 850 and talk to Alicia, one of the supervisors, at that moment my 25-year-old son went into total desperation and crisis to the point that he couldn't tell where he was and started to cry like a child; at that moment, the pain and helplessness of us here was indescribable for not being able to help him, finally after more than 7 or 8 calls to Mr. Juaranz, he agreed to put him on flight IB 6253 and had him searched all over the world airport until they finally found him and a certain Ramon from Iberia took him to the plane where he had to wait until he arrived.

For the latter, we deeply thank Mr. Juaranz, but the mistreatment, lack of sensitivity, and irresponsibility of Iberia employees have caused deep pain to the family and an impact of which we do not yet know the consequences on our son. .

This attitude of Iberia must be condemned in its entirety due to the deep impact it has caused and its mistakes that have had serious consequences on a young autistic person.

When I bought the ticket for him to travel, I asked the Iberia employees if he could have services since he was autistic, the girl's reaction was to ask me what autism was, then she asked me my age and told me that they did not offer services for adults, but if he did not speak Spanish there in Iberia he could ask for help in English, something that turned out to be false, I have witnessed how Iberia officers and employees become aggressive when people who appear to be physically Latin speak English, it is such an illogical attitude that it can only come from a pathological hatred against American citizens, because I cannot find another explanation for it.

We are evaluating alternatives but Iberia and AA should compensate this young man for the intense suffering they caused both to him and to his family and the responsible employees should be punished to the full extent of the word.",September 2022,"September 20, 2022",1.0,,,,1.0,1.0,,,

Iberia should have full responsibility of providing the passengers with information about the last flight, since the transaction was completed on their behalf. Upon request, the person at the counter was unwilling to provide any information about the reservation number (of the last flight which was operated by a different carrier). She was unbothered to help us in any way. Very irresponsible of Iberia, since all of the transactions were completed by the company and no information whatsoever about the last flight was given, just a simple “this flight is operated by a different carrier.” Customer service is unfriendly, not helpful and the company should at least provide full information about the flights they sell. A tremendous lack of communication between the two carriers, but the seller should be responsible. We did not once interact with the other carrier because Iberia was at all times the mediator, but when it concerned the last flight, they said they didn’t have anything to do with it.

Hot delayed flight & stolen items,New York City,Bari,International,"My fiancé and I flew roundtrip from JFK-Bari, Italy with a layover in Madrid. From JFK-MAD, we were stuck on the tarmac for almost two hours because they couldn’t get the engine started. The AC didn’t work without the engine on, it was 85°F (30°C) outside, and they insisted on keeping the window shades up, so the plane was incredibly hot. Our clothes were drenched in sweat and we had to sit in them for the next 10 hours. 

On the way back, the issues were again from MAD-JFK. I wasn’t able to pull up our boarding passes even after uploading pictures of our passports, as requested, and having those pictures be approved. Bari airport wasn’t able to give us our boarding passes either and MAD had to hand write our boarding passes. I’m guessing we got lost in the system somewhere because our bags made it to MAD but not JFK. Our bags then went from MAD-JFK-LGA-CLT-PHL-our home airport. 

We got our bags 5 days later and someone had gone through and stolen our alcohol, a power strip, my hair straightener, and all of my lipsticks (gross). I remembered that I’d seen our bags a few days ago at someone’s house in Queens, NY (I put AirTags in our bags) and figured out that an employee from the courier service, BEX Delivery, who delivered our bags from JFK-LGA had taken our bags home overnight and rifled through them. The cost to replace the lipsticks alone was like $400 (20 were stolen at $20 each), so they got away with $500 worth of our stuff. 

Iberia’s answer? $167.50 after over a month of back and forth, including them trying to deny the claim outright. They implied that they weren’t responsible because our stuff was stolen and didn’t just happen to spill out of our accidentally damaged bags.

* 3X additional cost of all my travel expenses in 3 weeks & 5 countries in Europe, to rebook my travel back home.

* 4 days to get home when it should have been just 1 day

* Having to abandon my luggage with serval sentimental belongings and laptop

* Missing crucial work opportunities

* Missing time with my family who I have not seen in over 3 years

Just to name a few of the many distresses that I am still trying to recuperate from.

Hope this heeds as a warning to fellow travellers and expecting @iberia and I can resolve this matter.",August 2022,"August 25, 2022",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
Absolutely terrible,Mumbai,Panama City,International,"While the trip itself was adequate, the airline lost 2 of our bags, and the follow up has been absolutely terrible. Customer service is a joke, no-one responds for days at a time, phone numbers don't connect, hours on hold etc, and, even when one does speak to an actual person, the only thing they say is ""we're aware it's missing and have an alert in place which will let us know when it surfaces"". In other words, we've done the bare minimum and have no desire to do anything else.

The worst airline.,Pamplona,Panama City,International,"I am a student at Spain and I always fly with Iberia because they are the only airline that has a direct flight from Panamá to Madrid. I have been traveling with them for 5 years and almost every experience I have had with them has been terrible. On June 30th I traveled from Pamplona to Madrid, spent the night because the layover was 12h and 50 minutes and then I flew to Panama. I had a Business Class ticket and have a Gold status with Iberia Plus. You would think that with this everything would have been perfect but that was far from the truth. When I was in Pamplona the flight got delayed 3h and we ended up arriving at Madrid at 2am instead of the original arrival time that was 11pm. Then when I was waiting in line to board the Madrid to Panama flight I was told to wait because my seat was “broken” and they had to assign me a new seat. I asked if I could be seated beside my little brother in other seats because we had chosen those seats months in advance for us to be seated together and they told me it wasn’t possible because the plane was at full capacity and my new seat was the “last available seat”. When I finally get inside I went to my new seat and saw that someone else was seated at my old seat that was supposedly broken. This made me really mad but I decided to not say anything else because I was really tired and just wanted to get home. When I arrived to Panamá, I received my luggage and I saw that both my bags had been opened because both locks were broken. When I arrived home, I checked everything inside the suitcases and saw that most of my things were stolen. Immediately I contacted Iberia for my 2 broken suitcases (now I can’t close them correctly because they were forced) and my stolen items. They responded to me that the bags being forced and damaged was “normal” and that they were not going to be responsible for that and for the stolen items they told me they weren’t responsible because some of the things stolen are not included in their transport contract. This is one of the many horrible experiences I have had flying with Iberia and with their customer service. If you can, never fly with them.",June 2022,"August 22, 2022",1.0,,,,,,,,
Theft in checked baggage - do not trust Iberia,Barcelona,New York City,International,"Do not trust this airline. I flew from Barcelona to JFK with layover in Madrid this month. 

First of all, they book flights with 1 hour layover which is minimum legal requirement, but it's not enough time to between Terminal 4 and 4S in Madrid. You have to deplane, walk miles in the airport, go through passport line, take the train to the next airport and boarding closes 15-20 minutes before the flight departs.  

Secondly, I checked my bag at Barcelona hours before my departure, so early there wasn't even a line at the check-in counter. I saw my bag get checked and leave on the belt. Somewhere between Barcelona and Madrid, airline staff or security staff went through all my stuff in my luggage and STOLE things from my checked baggage. They even dumped all the clothes from my laundry bag and went through my first aid kit. Whoever did it was very selective. They stole my camera accessories and gold jewelry pieces, which are small items that you wouldn't notice is gone until later when you need it. The gold jewelry pieces are fun but not significantly valuable. It's annoying to replace and a terrible way to end a trip to Spain.  

Iberia does not have a way for you to report stolen items. This airline's customer service is unresponsive. When I searched online for other reviews, I saw more stories from passengers with stolen goods in their checked bag from Barcelona and Madrid airports. Iberia really need to fix the security on their staff! This leaves a terrible experience for the flagship carrier of Spain.",August 2022,"August 22, 2022",1.0,,,,,,,,
Never again,Marrakech,Zagreb,International,"I will never fly Iberia again. Long story short, we used flight credits from their previous stuff ups to fly to Morocco. Flights were changed and canceled. 
2 hour delays at the airport when we finally got to fly.
We had to totally rearrange our accommodations which of course cost $$$ to take new flights and pay more for these. Then when we left Marrakesh the attendant at the checkin counter forced me to check in my carry on. Told me I could not board if I didn’t as it was a full flight.
I told her we had a 40 minute transfer in Madrid and that I was worried our bags would not come with us. She assured me they would, now we are in Croatia and have been waiting 3 days for our bags. Totally ruined our time here as we have to stay at our accommodations in case they show up. So pissed off right now.
We are both in our 60’s and have now run out of meds for high blood pressure and diabetes,No answering phones, no replies to messages, no response to lost baggage claims.

Horrible Airline with no Proper service and no inflight entertainment. Complete waste of money,Madrid,Boston,International,Horrible airline. The service in business class i would say below average.

Pretty awful,Madrid,Los Angeles,International,"Below average service on every level. First, they serve your meal to you (the meal itself was fine) and it then takes ages to be cleared up. It felt like so long just being sat there with the tray table open, unable to move or sit comfortably because the tray table is in the way. Second, during a 12hr 45m flight, they offer customers drinks maybe 4 times. Once with lunch, tapas, and the snack, and one more time in between. For flights that long, you’d expect staff to be present within the cabin and checking on what people need. After lunch service, they literally disappeared and you would see maybe one staff member walk down the length of your part of the plane every 15m, if that. Moreover, they’re completely unfriendly. Third, on every other long haul I’ve been on, I’ve been able to order snacks and drinks if I wanted to by pressing the call bell. During a long haul flight, I’d maybe do this once. Otherwise I’d usually just wait until service time to make things easier. Since I hadn’t seen staff, I pressed the call bell and asked the staff member who came over for an orange juice please. He replied “can you come up to the front and get it”. I was shocked. It’s like ordering a drink at a restaurant and having the staff member ask you to come to the kitchen to collect your beverage. It makes no sense - especially when we’re sat in these tiny seats for almost 13 hours non-stop. Completely disappointing. I would never waste money on this airline again. Only saving grace was that the pilots managed to get us there 40m early, and that the lunch was decent.",August 2022,"August 19, 2022",2.0,,,,,,,,
extremely poor level of customer service,New York City,Madrid,International,"A week prior to our flight, we paid for specific seats on the flight through the link provided in the email from Iberia.  When we tried to check in online the day before our trip no seats were assigned for any of the passengers.  Three different calls to customer service were absolutely excruciating.  Poor English speaking skills, extremely long hold time only to be told to have it resolved at the airport.  Once at the airport we were told that the person checking us in at the counter works for British Airways and can not do anything for us.  She went on to say that it is very common with Iberis to charge customers for seat selection and not deliver! Needless to say our family of five did not get to sit together, nor get extra leg room which we paid for. We filed official complaint with Iberia and received a reply that while they appreciate that we were inconvenienced, it is common to change seats due to the last minute change of craft! There was no last minute change of craft on our flight and even if there was seats were not assigned at the time of check in.
No refund was issued, just sentiments that they hope we have a better experience in the future.",August 2022,"August 18, 2022",2.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0

Where to start with these inept shanksters,Edinburgh,Santiago,International,"I can only describe my experience with Iberia as one not to be forgot (not in a good way). Originally booked 15th August (Mon) for them to cancel the flight from Edinburgh and reschedule for the next day. No communication to the public on this matter (the line being the service department doesn’t work the weekend) and 100 people including myself sitting with luggage at Edinburgh airport. Anyway benefit of the doubt and all that jazz fly from Edinburgh on 16th to London Heathrow. This is where the real clowning/fduckery begins. Land in Heathrow after a 2 hour delay in Edinburgh at 6pm with the connecting flight London to Madrid leaving at 6.45pm. A healthy sprint from terminal 5 to 3 plus connection security and I made the flight. Sadly my luggage (suitcase and guitar) were not so fortunate. Arrive in Madrid and as instructed wait at the belt for my luggage after landing at 10.30pm. Due to waiting till 11.30pm when the luggage began to flow miss my connecting flight to santiago at 11.45pm whilst finding out at 7am the following morning after a cracking night in the airport my suitcase and guitar are enjoying a night in Heathrow and will be on the next flight to Madrid and arrive at 2.30pm this afternoon (17th august). The great part in all this nonsense is that it’s my birthday tomorrow (Thu 18th august) and I will be on day 3 of my lovely holiday visiting my wives family in santiago still dealing with mongaloid tendencies in Madrid till 11.59pm when I finally get to chile. In fairness to Iberia I’ve been vouchered and given more flight time than the wright brothers would be proud of however I will 1 never use them again and 2. When I arrive back in Scotland on 31st of august be seeking a full refund plus Airbnb costs for 3 days, compensation for missing my birthday with my family and definitely be having a chat with the local papers back in Edinburgh.

I only made it to the connection flight because I shouted and begged hundreds of people to let me get ahead of the boarding control queue and after running 2 miles in 11 minutes and only because I was desperate to make that flight (which I had informed Iberia about) because my mother had just passed away and I had to get to my destination asap.

Zero Stars,Los Angeles,Madrid,International,"I've lived all over the world, I've flown all over the world, I've been on basically every airline currently running... and this is the worst one of all.

In the month leading up to our flight to Madrid, we did the responsible thing and paid to choose our seats ahead of time. Sounds easy, right? Well with Iberia's website it was a pain in the butt. My partner and I both received receipts of the transaction, but the website continued to show an alert that we HAD NOT booked our seats ahead of time. Strange, right? Well we made multiple calls to Iberia's customer service to resolve the issue. Each time, we had extremely rude encounters of people who said 1. this happens all the time (yikes), and 2. we could resolve it at the check-in counter at the airport, and 3. our paid seat choices would be honored. 

The day before the flight, we checked in after receiving the email saying we could. While going through the online check-in, the website suddenly said we had new seats (middle and separated). We called customer service once again, and they said 1. this happens all the time, and 2. we could resolve it at the check-in counter at the airport, and 3. our paid seat choices would be honored. 

You know where this is going... 

At the airport, after standing in an extremely long line for check in with other people with their own website frustrations, we were told our paid seat choices never went through (despite the charge) and the only seats available would be the back of the plane with no option to recline. I felt like we were being punished for doing the responsible things (paying to chose our seats and checking in 24 hrs before the flight). They wouldn't even offer us an upgrade, a refund, or free checked luggage. 

We were told we would be refund the charge for our seat choice... that still hasn't happened. 

On the return flight, the check-in counter did not print out our boarding passes for our connecting flight. Thankfully we were on top of things and were able to get it. The check-in counter said my request for a vegetarian meal was too late and I was suppose to request it 24 hrs in advance. I told her I had requested it a month ago with a customer service representative on the phone...

I showed him my connection flight pass and he finally printed my boarding pass but seemed like he was very unhappy to do it.

When the clean up came the stewardess dropped the tray on the floor at my seat with all the food. She didn't attempt to pick anything up. Everyone just walked through the food and carried it down the aisle.   The next time we saw an attendant was to offer a ""snack"" with less than an hour to go in the flight.  That left about 5 hours that someone could have cleaned up the food, or how about offering a drink during the flight.   This is the same attendant who banged into me everytime she came down that aisle.  For an airline that is so worried about covid, yes we had to wear a mask for the entire time regardless of vaccination status, you would think they would keep the airplane clean.

The customer service line couldn’t understand why they would not put us on the flight when we called . There is no Iberia help desk at the Orly airport in Paris so no help there . The manager was extremely rude and accused us of lying, telling us there was no way we were in line when we were supposed to be . We were treated disrespectfully by all of the staff at check in.

Lesson learned the hard way,Ibiza,Stockholm,Europe,"Had my return flight “rescheduled” twice, first time about a month prior to my trip. The change prevented me from getting on my connecting flight and I had to search for alternative flights on my own as no options were given to me. Second time they rescheduled was 2 days prior to the flight and they offered me either a refund or to fly 4 days later than my original booking. When I contacted them they refused to compensate me for any expenses I would accrue during these four days, not so much as a meal much less a viable alternative flight or accommodation. Ended up spending almost a €1000 with a different airline just to get home. They have absolutely zero respect for their customers and the booking you make means nothing to them, they change their flights as they please and don’t care if it disrupts your whole journey.

They are really are that bad,Rome,Chicago,International,"My family recently flew on Iberia Air (booked as American Airlines but operated by Iberia) from Rome to Chicago with a layover in Madrid.  My son has celiac so we entered a request online for Gluten Free meal, when we called later we were told you could only request at the gate during check in (at the check in told that we had to request this online well in advance), when on the plane we asked the attendant .if it was possible to get anything gluten free and they said we had to do that online, they then shoved my burnt possible in front of me saying it’s pasta (they were giving earlier passengers a choice but apparently had run out, then they shoved another plate into my sons spot and we had to raise our voice to pull it away from him as he would get very sick if he ate the ALL Gluten meal. Then at the Gate they did not have the space for everyone’s carry on so they stopped anyone with a carry on and had those family members who were not carrying the carry on go ahead.  They they grabbed our bags and said they were being checked (we didn’t want to check them because of the horror stories about Iberian Airline losing bags).  I was carrying my check in bag and that of my wife and son, because they were told to get on the plan already they said I had too many bags and tried to force me to pay for them because the other 2 passengers were no longer with me.  They also grabbed my daughters bag and checked it.  When we arrived in Chicago, we had to wait over an hour for bags to come out ( after a 11 hour flight and now in rush hour for our 6 hour drive home), all of my daughters souvenirs were smashed (she hadn’t planned on checking the bag so didn’t bubble wrap items).  On the flight the seats were uncomfortable (not as bad as Frontier Airlines but still bad).  Ohh the bathrooms, for a full plane 8 across and about 60 rows, 1 toilet was out of order, another toilet wouldn’t flush (no sign so just full of toilet paper etc) another toilet the sink didn’t work, 4th toilet barely flushed and was filled with toilet paper an unclean to sit on, we were not allowed to use the 2 business class toilets or the 2 toilets near the back which I think the attendants wanted to keep open and clean for themselves (yes on a very long flight).  No water or drinks except during the meals and attendants wouldn’t help you except to tell you to pull up your mask.  Also, they would not allow you to check in by going online so we tried calling in from a foreign country, after several attempts of people telling you different things (non worked), they told us we had to download the WhatsApp (apparently they rely on 3rd party apps to run their reservation system- but still didn’t work), they then said we would have to check in at the airport 4 hours before the flight.  No one at the Iberia counter the night before and no one came to the Iberia Airlines counter until 2 1/2 hours before the flight - so we are glad we got up at 3 AM to sit around an empty airport counter (all other airlines had people at their counter at 3 am and the night before).

Disaster with Iberia Airlines,Madrid,San Francisco,International,"Our experience with Iberia Airlines was disastrous way to end our trip to Portugal and Spain, we had serval problems which caused major inconveniences for us.
During our transfer we were held up by staff members causing us to almost miss our flight. Iberia Airlines had an additional station to check our passports, which caused us to be late for boarding and separated our family as they took my brother and mother into a side room to be searched even though they had already gone through airplane security. It didn’t help either that the man checking our passports told us the wrong line to go to. Now I don’t know if this is procedure in that airport but it appeared that Iberia Airlines was the only Airlines adding on this extra passport check.
Now Iberia Airlines food I would say is good for airplane food when you actually get it.  My whole family has a gluten allergy and we called before hand to make sure we would be receiving gluten free food but however when dinner came around it turned out they ran out of gluten free meals by the time they reached my family, now we most likely think this was an error on the Flight attendant’s part as there was option between the pasta and the chicken, however she just didn’t go to the people with allergies first. This was also a problem on the flight to Madrid when they didn’t have any gluten free meals in stock.  In addition to low amount of food my family got for dinner, their other meal, excluding the snack, was all gluten resulting in my younger siblings going without food for the last five hours of the flight, which was hard for them.
To crown off this stellar experience when we arrived in San Francisco, we discovered our bags were still in Madrid after our transfer, which seemed to be a problem for a lot of people considering the line for the baggage assistance booth.

We missed our first connecting flight even though we were told by staff we should have no problem making our connection, then the ground staff seemed annoyed to rebook our flight when they knew we wouldn't have made it. Then on our return flight we were told there would be plenty of people working passport control to get us through the airport quickly so we would make our connection. There was only ONE person working passport control and we had to SPRINT through the airport to make our connection. We were one of the last people on the plane and had we not been young, healthy and in shape there was no way we would have made our flight.

"Like really, really bad",Porto,Chicago,International,"I don't write reviews ever, but I'm making an exception for Iberia because I want to prevent others from flying with Iberia. 

We booked through American Airlines (and because I now know they are affiliated with Iberia, I will no longer be flying with American Airlines, even if their flights are the cheapest option). We booked our flight from Porto, Portugal to Chicago O'Hare. At Porto, the Iberia staff showed up so late that we all began to get worried. We got on our flight to Madrid where we were going to have a layover before flying home to Chicago. However, our flight was delayed by so long that by the time we got to Madrid, our flight to Chicago had left without us. We then expected an Iberia agent to come over and tell us that they had arranged another flight for us, but that did not happen. Reader: we spent three hours in Madrid asking Iberia agent after Iberia agent what we should do, and all we got was a few shrugs and vague pointing upwards, which we eventually realized meant to go upstairs to a customer service desk. We stood in line for about 45 minutes with everyone else who was stranded (including one gentleman who had been stranded for TWO DAYS). One of our party decided to go to our original gate downstairs just to check if any agent was there. He then called us saying the gate agent said we could get on the flight to Boston which would then go to Chicago! 

Indeed, we got on the flight to Boston, but our bags were gate checked (this is the last time we ever saw them). That flight to Boston was also delayed enough that we missed our connection to Chicago. We did go by baggage claim to see if our luggage was there, and weirdly ours was not but our friends' were. There were no Iberia agents to be found to discuss our problem with, and the American Airlines agent told us the only flight they could get us on was the next morning. For family reasons, this was unacceptable, so we ended up purchasing direct, one-way tickets home. I won't go into this bit anymore, but every single flight that day was delayed, but United (who we flew with at the end) actually helped us and even held a flight for us. 

The next morning, I started calling Iberia about our luggage which is part 2 of this never ending saga. We never got any call directly from Iberia that our luggage was located or would be sent to us. Any communication has been entirely one-sided. Over the last two months, I've called Iberia about once a week or more, and have received conflicting information. Even with my luggage tag, they can't seem to find our bags. I've been told our bags will be mailed to us, I've been told they were in Chicago (they weren't, I drove there to check), I've been told to email iberia.com with my information (which is hilarious because that's a website and not an email), I've been told case number only to have it not work online, I've been told I would hear follow up information about out bags in five minutes and never heard back, I've told at least fifteen different people my baggage tag number and described the contents of our luggage in-depth, but to no avail. Essentially, it's beginning to look like Iberia has lost our bags completely and is making it impossible to receive compensation, simply because there is no clear path to requesting compensation. 

So, if you're reading this and wondering if you should book with Iberia or American... don't. And if you're Iberia, I'd love to hear from you. You have my email, my phone number, my baggage tag, my flight confirmation number, my ticket number, and at this point part of my soul.",May 2022,"July 18, 2022",1.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0
Get what you pay for,Boston,Lisbon,International,"This airline is a cluster f*ck. 

We booked with them because they were the cheapest fare and we got what we paid for.

The employees with this airline seem to not care. Checkin opens two hours before your flight and they’ll stand there doing nothing until that mark.

We were delayed 90 minutes flying out of Boston. When we got to Madrid we needed to run to our connecting flight. Didn’t get to take advantage of that priority boarding I paid extra for!

Coming home was an absolute mess. Published guidance says be at the airport at least 3 hours before your flight; we got there 4 hours early to be safe. After standing in line for an hour an Iberia employee walked through the line and made anyone not on the very next flight get out of the line.

We watched every other airline efficiently check passengers in. Iberia couldn’t seem to figure out how to get out of its own way.

Online checkin doesn’t work, the app doesn’t work and virtually everyone leaving Lisbon had some kind of issue. My wife and I checked in at the same time and were given two different boarding groups!

There was some kind of problem with my passport picture for the return flight, but WTF can’t they use the one I uploaded for the outbound flight? It’s not like the damn thing expired while I was away!

Infotainment didn’t work for anyone on the outbound flight; on the homebound flight my display crashed after 10 minutes and never came back up.

There’s no boarding procedure - lines started and ended wherever passengers felt like standing.

As Bad as the reviews say,Madrid,Athens,Europe,"So we read extensively all the trip advisor reviews—and thank goodness we did. We were prepared for bad service so we did not check bags, did not upgrade and got to the airport super early.  Even so, one of the worst flights ever from a comfort and customer service perspective. I took a small bag of food for my family and I to eat on the plane for a 3 1/2 hour flight as we have hypoglycemia issues. The rude gate attendant told me that counted as a “bag” and therefore she had to check k in my carryon. She literally grabbed my roll on even as I explained my bag was just food for medical reasons. Nope…she didn’t budge and was about to check my bag when I told her absolutely not, since I had read the horror stories of lost luggage. I just left all our food  behind.
Of course there wasn’t enough overhead space for everyone’s bags so folks were forced to Check bags anyway (not us). They didn’t offer any movies or entertainment unless you wanted to pay for Wi-Fi on your personal device. The seats were so small you couldn’t move (and I’m a small person). The seats didn’t recline. The USB port under my seat didn’t work so my phone died. They dont serve any food or snacks or WATER unless you pay for  them. Yes, even water. 
Overall, worse plane experience I’ve ever had since  the old People’s Express airline from the 1980’s (when I was a child ) which went bankrupt.

We would swim to Spain before flying Iberia,Porto Santo Island,Boston,International,"Our nightmare really started at the beginning - flight from Boston/Madrid/Bilbao.  We tried to check-in three hours early to give us enough time to get to security and arrive at gate on time.  Iberia doesn’t open their check-in until two hours before scheduled flight.  Luckily, we stood and waited as line quickly got long, and we found out later some people at end of line were denied booking because they were too late.  That really is Iberia’s fault since they give passengers only the two hours.  Since they overbook, this helps them.  

We paid extra to fly Premium Economy as we wanted to be in a two-seater because of Covid.  When we were issued our tickets, we weren’t seated together but in different sides of the plane each forced to sit next to a stranger.  No one would assist us, service manager rude and made a point of ignoring us.  

Once we got to Madrid to transfer to Bilbao, they changed our gate FOUR times.  We spent an hour walking from gate to gate as they were all a distance from each other.  Luckily, we found a fellow Spanish traveler who we ran with (literally) to the last gate with minutes to spare.   There is nobody from Iberia around or willing to help plus no one speaks English.  

Our flight home was worse.  Getting thru Madrid passport control is a nightmare.   People shouting and pushing trying to make flights and just two disinterested employees checking passports for hundreds of people.  We had three hours between our flight and barely made it.  

By the way, don’t waste your money on
Premium Economy.  There are no trays on the back of the seat, and the contraption that holds your trays takes up a lot of room.  The fellow in front of me reclined his seat, and I was pinned in.  Had to ask him to put seat back so I could use bathroom.  When he fell asleep, couldn’t move from seat.  Didn’t want to use bathroom anyways as it was dirty and disgusting.  

Food was the worst meal we have ever had on a plane.  A small tray of sticky, overcooked rice with mushrooms.  We think it wasn’t stored properly as when we got home, we were both sick with food poisoning.  Breakfast was an overripe banana or a soggy, small tart.   

Had to beg for water.  With dinner gave you a cup with 6 oz.  Only water or OJ - no sodas or seltzer.  

Stewardesses disappeared for most of flight. Didn’t matter much as they ignored you and didn’t understand English welll.  Or so they say.  Probably fluent in Boston.

Iberia Lost Our Bags on June 28th. Today is July 9th.,Jerez De La Frontera,Florence,Europe,"My three bags have been missing for 11 days. I have not been able to get any answers from the airline as to the location of my bags. We purchased business class tickets and our bags were tagged as priority, but they didn't make it onto the plane from Madrid to Florence.  Iberia's website states business class bags are a priority.

We were also put on Vueling instead of Iberia for the Florence to Madrid flight. Vueling doesn't have Business Class and we weren't offered any compensation for the change. We feel like this was a bait and switch. Vueling charges for everything in flight.

Nonexistent service,Boston,Barcelona,International,"The Iberia (BOS to BCN) has been so far the worst airline to deal with. We were unable to choose seats until approximately 36 h before and for additional costs. When we called their number it took about 1 h to get a life person and we were told that those are their policies on some flights. 
Their website is nonfunctional. I established an account (several times) but if signed out it would not let you sign back in and stated that username or password was incorrect.  Iberia app worked a little bit better but was extremely slow.
The departure was almost 2 h late. 
On board we got charged twice for a pair of air phones. 
On the way back I was unable to get online boarding pass or select the seat.  I was told by one agent that some of my data might have been ""lost"" and the only way to get boarding pass was at the airport. I got two seats together for my son and husband and I was assigned a random seat at the airport away from them. There was no way of changing the seat since the flight was full. It turned out it was some kind of random security check.",June 2022,"July 8, 2022",1.0,,,,,,,,
STAY AWAY FROM IBERIA,Miami,Prague,International,"We booked our summer vacation flight to Europe directly with Iberia thinking it would go smooth if there's no third party involved.....
We couldn't be more wrong!!!
When we make a reservation we always pay for the checked bags upfront rather than at the airport since it is cheaper and more convenient for us. And so we did this time!
When we got to the airport and started to check in at Iberia counter we were told that we need to pay for our 2 checked bags. 
Luckily we brought with us all the copies of the  booking along with the payment confirmation. Well, after 30 min of arguing and even talking to a supervisor we were forced to pay for the bags again to avoid missing the plain. 
They said that their system doesn't show that we paid for the bags and all the copies we showed them were not enough proof!!
I have immediately contacted Iberia via Facebook and explained what happened and when they finally replied it said that we have paid for the bags both ways and we're all set!
Not giving any suggestions on refunding the extra charge!!
Ok. At least they have it in the system and there will be no more trouble. ...wrong again!
Same thing happened on the returning flight from Prag with the only difference that the person we were checking in with was more arrogant about it.
Ignoring our copies and completely ignoring our conversation with Iberia on Facebook.
So we had to pay again. 
Now I have been fighting for our $330 of extra unrightfull charges for over a week and I have never felt more helpless!!!
There is no way to make this type of clame on their website and if you thing there's an email for customers service....don't be naive. Doesn't exist!!!!
The customer service on phone is horrible and they barely speak English so it makes explaining your situation even more difficult. 
Not mentioning the long wait time getting connected or on hold.

You make it all the way to the gate and are told to go and fork out £15 for a pack of 10 masks. Once you finally make it through to the plane, some customers are being given masks. Absolute scam.

Worst Airline in the World,Indianapolis,Barcelona,International,"THE WORST AIRLINE IN THE WORLD. We flew to our daughter's one and only wedding from the US to Barcelona, Spain (we arrived June 18, she was to be married on June 26). The airline lost 4 of our 6 suitcases. The 4 bags had my dress (mother of the bride), my other daughter's bridesmaid dress and our three granddaughters' flower girl dresses, tiaras, veils and gloves, as well as many other valuables. Those things will never be work/used.  I waited in line for hours at the airport when we arrived to make a claim because hundreds of other passengers on Iberia lost their luggage, too.  After making my claim, I called the airline baggage claim every single day, several times a day, hoping to find out something before the wedding, which wouldn't occur until 7 days later. They had 7 days to locate our bags. THEY NEVER EVEN LOCATED THE BAGS DURING THAT 7 DAYS.  We told them they were at JFK, we KNEW American Airline had delivered them to Iberia in JFK.  They nevertheless had NO INFORMATION about where our bags  could be. They said they would text or email me when they found out something. Sometimes when I called, they would have new information, but I never received an email or text about it. That information was sometimes confirmed by other agents, other times the agent said they could not see anything similar in the records. It was like they were looking at different information.  I told the agents many times, if they didn't find the bags by the wedding day, forget it, just return them to my address in the US. Guess what?  They DELIVERED the bags to BARCELONA the day AFTER THE WEDDING!  We gave them local Barcelona address and phone number SEVERAL TIMES. However, they never had a record of those whenever I called back. They ended up couriering a bag to my daughter's apartment in Barcelona, but never bothered to email or call to tell us it was coming, or to arrange for the delivery. She lives in an apartment - SHE NEEDED TO BE THERE WHEN THEY ARRIVED.  They just showed up, unannounced, and when she didn't answer the buzzer, they left and said they would not re-deliver it. So they expected her to just sit in her apartment day after day awaiting the delivery of bags that we were never told arrived.  She works, so she ended up having to pay someone to go pick up the bag from the airport. In the meantime, the other 3 bags, which we were told would be at the airport for identification purposes when the hired person showed up - were not there when the hired person showed up. This was five days ago. I have never received an email or text message about the whereabouts of my bags. I don't know where my US bound bags are. It is the middle of summer and all our summer clothes, toiletries, expensive skin and hair care products, a babysitter's mental health medication and other important things are in those bags.

"If I Could  Give them Zero, I Would!!",Madrid,Washington DC,International,"We specifically chose a British Airways for our return home from Spain, so as to avoid this incompetent company, as we had had issues with them before. But when we got to the airport, we were informed that the flight had become an Iberian Air flight.  Not happy, but resigned to it, we went to the desk to ask about checking in, even as it was 3 hours before our flight. The woman at the desk yelled at my husband and told him he could not check us in until 2 hours before, so we waited. We got to check in, exactly 2 hours prior to boarding, we were told we could not sit together, as we were the LAST to check in, and the only 2 seats left were 11 rows apart. Furthermore, they would not send our bags with us unless we paid them another €166.  Let me back up and say that we paid for our luggage when we booked our flights. In addition, we paid for our 2 seats and had assigned seats. But we got there, and were told there was no record of it. No record of it? We produced our confirmation, which was met with shrugged shoulders. 

It gets worse: Across the aisle in my same row, there was a man with his daughter. They each had rattled, congested “sick-sounding”  coughs. THEY WERE UNMASKED, for the entire flight!!! The staff served them anyway—did NOT make them put their masks on. Not one of the flight attendants said a word to them, and they did not care.  So far, I have avoided Covid, and I pray that’ll still be the case. 

My meal: There was, supposedly, a choice between chicken and pasta. I do not eat pasta. They never gave me a choice. My sense of it is that they had way more of their version of pasta than chicken, and ran out if it before they got to the 3rd row in the middle section.  I wanted water with my meal and was given a small cup with about 4 ounces of water. This is inadequate for an almost 8 hour flight. Luckily, I had a bottle of water with me.  Again, resigned to just eating the meal, as I had no choice, I started, but stopped after the first bite. I absolutely could  not eat this particular version of it: it was laced with hot pepper sauce. My system doesn’t tolerated jalapeños. I ate the roll, the tiny amount of salad, and cake. Luckily, I had bought a nice sandwich in the airport for lunch and had half of it left, so I had food, but what if I hadn’t?  

The lavatory was filthy and unattended before the flight began. How do I know this? Because I was the first to use it, as soon as I could after take off: Disgustingly dirty sink, water all over the place, and an un-flushed seat liner hanging off the toilet seat. There was no soap  in the soap container. 

One thing after another, we finally landed. I was never so happy to be home and appreciate our own airlines in the USA.  We got to baggage claim. When we got our luggage, my bag was so badly handled that it was cracked, and is no longer useable. So, I’ll have to put out a chunk of change to buy a new suitcase. Thanks so much, Iberian Air. 

NONE OF THIS IS ACCEPTABLE. 

This is the absolute worst airline. I have never had any of these issues with another airline. Every time we’ve had to fly with Iberian Air, there’s been some issue. This is the last time I will ever fly with these incompetent and dishonest people.

I immediately locate Iberia's phone number and ask them what was the matter they assured me that the ticket number was good and valid and they recommend I contact Expedia. I contacted Expedia give them the Expedia itinerary number and ticket number they intern called Iberia and kept me waiting on the phone until the flight that my girlfriend was supposed to be on had already taken off. We have since talked to Iberia and they just keep telling us to get in touch with Expedia which we have an Expedia tells us that Iberia tells them that they are trying to investigate this matter to give them 48 to 72 hours and they would call me back I have yet to receive a phone call or email correspondence from Expedia except they keep emailing me that they are working on this situation and I will know something and they will give me a call. We have begged and pleaded with him to reschedule a flight so that my girlfriend can get back home but we have not had any luck. her visa and passport are completely up-to-date the only issue was that the person at the airport denied her access to the plane because they said the ticket was invalid and no good hello baby I hope you read my email message before you took off to come here to chat with me because I am needing your passport number,June 2022,"June 29, 2022",1.0,,,,1.0,1.0,,1.0,

Fighting for my life,New York City,Madrid,International,"Iberia should be out of business. My experience with Iberia was horrible. Starting from check in @ JFK. 
I originally purchased my ticket via Expedia. I was given voucher for 1 checked bag & Iberia did not honor it. I was charged $75 vs the $64 they charge on the app. Then, I board the plane, everything was fine until after they provided dinner, I asked for water and it seemed as if the stewardess didn't want to give it to me. It took at least 10 minutes to receive the water.
Arriving to Madrid, I had a layover. My connecting flight boarding time was at 7:05AM. We landed in Madrid @ 6:30AM, you have to go through customs!
The security at customs was rude, she was inconsiderate. She made me miss the connecting flight. You'd think Iberia would accommodate and put me on the next flight for 8:30AM. Iberia put me on standby until 3:50PM flight. 
I was fighting for my life to get on the 3PM flight, i was traveling by myself and it wasn't my fault i missed the connecting flight. That's another thing about Iberia, any time you spoke with a customer service representative at the airport, the first thing they do is point the finger at YOU! ""It's not our fault, it's your fault"". No one wanted to speak English when they spoke it very well. This is all in Madrid, they're home base! 
It's an inconvenience on Iberia's part. Since, we landed 30 minutes before the connecting flight, knowing travelers have to go through customs ! I didn't understand why I wasn't called to board on the 8:30 am flight when i was one of the first persons to be on standby. There was a lot of people who missed the connecting flight. What Iberia does is, they over book flights and don't assign seats, even for purchased tickets. Super inconvenient. 
In the end, coming home to the USA was another fight for my life. The app never updated passengers to confirm delayed flight, to pay for luggage the app wasn't working, i had to get my receipt and confirmation at the gate, i arrived 5 hours before departure time,  there's only 1 person working at the gate.

Under no circumsatnces check your bag into the hold,Madrid,London,Europe,"Around 20 travellers did not get their checked in hold bags, as Iberia put profit above customer service. for the MADRID to HEATHROW flight you need to get to T4S at Madrid Airport.

It takes around 40 minutes to get from check in to the gate T4s. Signs when you go through security warn you it takes 23 minutes from the other side of security. 

As such there is often not enough time for the bags to get to the plane.

I was told by BA staff in T5 that is costs around £3000 per mnte a plane stays on the runway, This makes it cheaper to take off on time without all the bags than with them if they dont get to plane on time.

On 25.6.2022 around 15 people (I observed) lost their bags. One person I spoke to was manager of a music band playing Glastonbury the next day and had 7 checked in bags of muscial instruments go missing.

It takes some getting used to,San Francisco,Seville,International,"I read the other reviews and chuckled and had to add our experience in solidarity with other travelers. Our family took our first (and possibly last) trip  with  Iberia through codeshare with American Airlines.  Last year we flew to Madrid on Delta without issue, piece of cake connection in JFK.  Earlier this year we traveled to Paris on United which was wonderful.  This time we chose American/ Iberia because it was really the only way to get to and from Sevilla and Jerez on the return in one day.   I usually avoid codeshare flights but we felt the risk was worth it. I also know airline workers are having a hard time right now. 

1. Connecting in JFK from American to Iberia is challenging.  Signage is poor (that is partly on American Airlines who simply has banners on stands in random places in the terminal saying Madrid flights depart out of terminal 7 without further information of how to get there).  Unclear how to get to terminal 7.  I stopped a random flight attendant in the terminal and she sighed and said you don't have much time and explained to me the process.  Must exit American terminal, take a train, try to find Iberia check in desk in terminal 7 (its literally behind the wall of the other airlines in a corner that you cannot see from the the main lobby), and then repeat TSA security.  The Iberia check in agent said you have 25 minutes to go through security and get to the flight and you better not miss it because we don't have any open seats to Madrid for days.  
2. Luggage delayed on arrival for one family member for 3 days.  We missed phone call for delivery of luggage and when calling back 10 minutes later they said the driver just left 5 minutes ago and will try again tomorrow.  I would recommend putting an AirTag in luggage so it can be traced if flying Iberia.  
3. The Iberia Express plane has seats so close when passenger in front reclined her seat I could practically perform dental work on her. The passenger was almost lying in my lap.  They cram over 220 people on an Airbus A321, American puts 180 on their version. 
4. The Iberia Express flight back to Madrid was literally taxing onto the runway and passengers were still trying to cram luggage overhead and trying to determine who is sitting where and standing in the aisles as we were about to take off. 
5. Connection time from Iberia Express to Iberia in Madrid took 1.5 hours to get from Terminal T4 to T4S where mainline flights depart, causing us to nearly miss our connecting flight home from Madrid.  Very crowded, down multiple escalators several floors, taking a train for a 5-10 minute ride, then up 3 escalators, on last escalator there were too many people at the top so they turned it off and blocked us from going up, causing 10-15 minute delay, then waiting in long line for passport control, then walking another 5-10 minutes to gate, then having passport evaluated again in front of gate. People were freaking out they were missing their flights as we stood in line after line.  
6. Iberia from Madrid to SFO is a long 12.5 hour flight.  The flight attendants provided lunch and drinks and cleaned up and then literally disappeared for 8-9 hours.  I saw some passengers with boxes of food and drinks.  Apparently, the galley operates as a snack bar, where passengers just go and request food and drinks.  No announcement about this was made.  Those in the know, apparently know to do this.  We were so thirsty and hadn't had any time to buy any water in Madrid that I finally got up to see what was happening in the galley, and the flight attendant was sitting in a chair -  a lawn chair - in the galley.  She did provide 2 glasses of water but no offer of a snack box.  
7. The lavatory on the newer A330 was very dirty, the floor was wet and there were bits of towels and toilet paper all over the floor and the sink.  I've never seen anything like it on any plane before.
8. I am having to change my teenager's return flight home who is still there on an educational visit because the connection time will be too short on the return (it is less than 1.5 hours in Madrid).  I am having to pay over $1000 fare difference to do this with American Airlines because they are selling flights with connections that are simply not doable and we did not know any better when booking.  
9. The Iberia seat selection on their website is glitchy.  

So in summary, Iberia got us there and back safely so that is great, but the quality of the experience was lacking.  If you know this going in, and are able to pad your connections (at least 3 hours), and can bring your own food and water to supplement what they provide, and enjoy quirks, then Iberia may be alright.",June 2022,"June 26, 2022",2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0

I practically was one of the last 4 on the flight  SB after the flight was held up for over 30 minutes watching the agent give away people seats to standby folks that she wanted to give them away too! Now my original flight connecting Ny to Madrid left gates closed  couldn’t get on, after  we arrived at 10:40 am late!!! flight was suppose to arrive 10:23  am connecting 11:15, to Madrid there was no way I was making the connecting flight with the incompetence of these people!  After walking 5 miles to gate and let’s not forget customs! Then to have to damn near beg to get on the next flight 3:00 pm
only to  end up sitting in the airport at 12 midnight looking for my f ing luggage is a disgrace! I will not and I repeat will not be traveling back to Madrid for any reason  or thru!  Tons and tons of luggage piled up! You can’t tell me people just left their luggage, their luggage did not arrive with them.  This is a f u airport! No customer service! Please shut the hell down!

From booking a flight, paying for cancel flexibility and still having to pay $30 to make a change, to never receiving a refund for luggage fee after calling numerous times to almost missing the connecting flight because there wasn't enough time allotted to get through passport control, and no leg room, it was the worst flight and experience I've had in my life.

They made us wait until the flight had taken off and find us a place in the next plane. It took a couple of hours until we got our reservation for a Level flight the following day, which meant smaller, less comfortable seats.

Most of the staff was helpful and understanding: they tried to make their best to help us but they were clearly understaffed and overwhelmed.

Airline communicated us we would get a compensation for the inconvenience (it is mandatory under EU regulation) and that it should be paid right away. This was more than 2 months ago and we have not received our compensation. At first, customer services kindly helped us and told us the payment should arrive in a couple of weeks. This was more than a month ago. The last time we called them they said they cannot do anything and suggested us to add a new complaint about our previous complaint using the website.

Iberia is not worthy,Madrid,San Francisco,International,"Writing this review a day after we flew from Portugal to Madrid to SFO. We did not have any expectations when we booked British Airways with connecting flights through Iberia. Upon reading all the review now in TripAdvisor, we could relate to all that of what we’re said here:
- Do not use Iberia with connecting flight 
  > We got in to Madrid from Lisbon after 55 minutes of flight
  > Our connecting flight is about 1 hr and we thought that was plenty of time, Noooo
  > We had to walk/run far to terminal S, then catch a tram that takes you to another terminal
  > Upon arriving to the other terminal, we had to go in the Immigration line
  > we thought that was weird because we don’t normally go through immigration on a connecting flight but when we asked one of the airport staff, he said, we all have to go through immigration
  > We got through immigration, the sign to our gate (49) says 7 mins
  > No way it was 7 mins by walking! The gate was too far, we had to run, not walk. 
  > Then we got in the area, another set of folks were there and screened our passports and boarding passes further delaying us
  > We finally got in to our gate, presented the boarding passes, again and stood in line with all the other SFO bound folks sweating from running

- Iberia does not offer food options
> All of the flight attendants in our flight were older, and didn’t really care much about the people they were supposed to provide service to
> Maybe those folks didn’t care much of any feedback as they were rude
> They don’t ask or tell you that they’ve ran out of food options, they just gave the tray to us without even telling us what it was
> They gave us coffee which probably amounted to 6 ounces only as it was half of already a tiny cup
> They did not give us snack, but good thing my husband went in the back and saw people getting tapas boxes, so he did the same thing
> Later, we found out that anyone could go I. The back and just help themselves 
> This was a 13 hours flight and if we did not happen to go in the back, we would have starved

- Toilet was dirty
 > Every time we use the toilet, it was untidy with wet floors and pieces of paper
 > None of us observed a single flight attendant attending to any of the toilet stalls

Second rate.,Mexico City,Madrid,International,"I thought that, as part of One World, Iberia would be a safe choice of airline. I was wrong.

The seating installed in economy class in the A350 used for this 12-hour flight has been designed for much smaller creatures than reasonably slim adult humans, and is both too narrow and too close to the seat in front. What's more, the cabin service was terrible. The meal was barely edible and the drinks service was non-existent. No snacks were available from the galley, and the crew - while polite - were a million miles from the helpful, accommodating crew that you meet on airlines such as Emirates.

One might hope that this flight was an aberration but, due to the design of the aircraft and the service on offer, it clearly wasn't.

The worst airline ever,Chicago,Naples,International,"After 2 years of being locked in , Me, my wife, and our 2 adult children decided to take a 1 week vacation in Naples/Amalfi coast .
We booked the trip through Travelocity with Iberia airlines with connection in Madrid, we bought business plus tickets
The flight out of Chicago was delayed by more than 1 hour .
The service was good, the food was bad
When we arrived in Madrid we found out that we missed our 8:50 am connecting flight to Naples, the only other flight to Naples was 8:05 pm, so we were stranded in Madrid airport more that 12 hours and despite having business plus tickets we were not allowed to use the Iberia VIP lounge at the airport, we were given vouchers for lunch accepted only in few places at the airport and the food was bad,

I’m still in Madrid airport now and just saw on the monitor that the flight was delayed again from 8:05 pm to 9:40 pm which means if no further delays we will not make it to our hotel in Amalfi till around 1:00 in the morning

They don't seem to log the luggage electronically which is UNACCEOTABLE in this day and age. THEY ARE AN EMBARRASSEMENT TO SPAIN AND AIRLINES IN GENERAL. THEY SOULD BE KICKED OUT OF THE AIRLINES FEDERATIONS AND SUED BY CUSTOMER SUPPORT GROUPS FOR RUDE AND ABUSIVE SERVICE!!!

I STRONGLY AVOID USING THIS AIRLINE TO ANYONE AND CREATING A MOVEMENT TO BOYCOTT THEM UNTIL THEY SORT THINGS OUT......

TO ALLOW THIS IS A TRAVESTY !!!!!!

Imagine you or anyone of your family stranded without your medication and having the airlines hang-up the phone on you despite being cordial on every call.

I was attacked by an Iberia employee,Madrid,Bologna,Europe,"I was attacked and menaced by one of your workers at the Madrid airport. I was queuing at the gate with my boyfriend, carrying my hand luggage, which was - as expressely stated both on my ticket and my boarding pass - included, when a woman wearing a doubtful uniform (not an hostess' nor a security's one, just an anonimous red polo shirt with a small Iberia logo on the chest) without saying a word came towards me and tried to attach a label on my luggage. I speak very little spanish, but out of kindness, after gesturing her to stop with my hand, I asked her in spanish why she was doing that. She shouted at me in a very unpolite manner that it was the company's policy and tried again to touch my luggage without my permission. I gestured her again to stop and started to explaining her in english, since I was not able to do that in spanish, that on the ticket I paid for was clearly written that I could take a luggage of that size with me on the plane and that, therefore, I had put in there fragile things and medications I needed for my health condition. After a couple of words she stopped me, again in a very rude way, and shouted at me in spanish that she did not speak english, then tried again to attach the label to my luggage. I then felt very insulted for such a disrespectful behaviour, grabbed the label and threw it to the ground, stating in english that I would not let her touch and take away my personal belongings without an explanation. At this point, she made an incredible scene, shouting and gesturing that I had hit her, insulting both me and my boyfriend and then running behind the gate desk. I tried to follow her, wanting to apologize for having thrown away the label (of course without touching her) and to show her my ticket in the attempt, one more time, to receive an explanation, but another woman got in the way and started to make a scene herself, shouting that I hit her collegue, that they were denying boarding to both me and my boyfriend and that they were going to call the police to arrest me. I was simply shocked, because in so many years travelling around the world with so many different companies nothing like this had never occured to me, neither I had never witnessed to something like this. Since the woman talking to me could not have seen what had happened between me and her collegue, my boyfriend tried to explain to her that I did not touch her collegue, but just grabbed the label. At this point, that woman also ran away behind the gate desk, keep shouting in front of all the other passengers queuing that we were not going to board and I was going to get arrested by the police. We then waited for the police, while the gate remained closed, but they never came. Instead, after a while a man approached us, asking us what had happened. My boyfriend and I explained everything to him and said that we were ready to look at the security cameras, if he did not believe us. He was very kind and in a very good english explained to us that we were going to board with no problem and that, being that particular aircraft very small, no trolleys were allowed on board. I said that in that case I would leave my luggage with no problem, but we pointed out that the woman did not go on attaching labels to other passengers' luggages. Very embarassed, he stated that she was probably choosing arbitrarily which ones to label and then gave dispositions to the hostesses to label all the passengers' hand luggages. So they did and let us board with no problem, while the two women who attacked us had go away. What can I say? I usually never complain when I am not satisfied with a service, because I understand yours is a stressful and difficult job and, being a worker myself, I know that we all can have a bad day, but this was definitely too much. It was a nightmare experience, which left me nervous and unwell for all the flight, and I think I will never fly again with you, fearing that something similar may happen again.",June 2022,"June 14, 2022",1.0,,,,,,,,
"cramped flight, late on arrival, no reward for nine-hour layerover due to lateness, bad food.",Washington DC,Berlin,International,"Probably my single worse flying experience of the last 20 years. Starting with not being able to check in online for both legs of my light, then being given only one bording pass once I arrived at the airport and waited in line for over an hour: moving on to the tiny seats with virtually no leg room, the useless headphones, and the mediocre in-flight meal; and culminating in the fact that the roughly 90 minute flight delay caused me to miss my conneting flight to Berlin. After waiting about an hour in a customer service line, I was  a given a connecting flight NINE HOURS LATER. The consolation prize was a meal ticket for a ""restaurant"" in Madrid, which turned out to be a third-rate cafeteria.

Avoid terrible experience Not worth 1 star,London,Madrid,Europe,"Recently experienced the worst flight I have ever had. From check in to arrival it was a nightmare. !. Told at check in if we wanted to put any hand luggage in the hold we could free of charge.There were 9 of us including 2 x 6 month old twins. We decided to put most in the hold and kept 3 of which one had the babies milk, nappies etc in, the others had snacks ,ipads etc. When we attempted to board was told very abruptly we cannot take any on plane as no space. We tried to argue but to no avail. Fortunately a lady at another desk said she would allow the babies case. We then had to carry all ipads etc in our hands as no bag to carry on place. Prior to boarding had an issue at customs as at check in had produced an extra boarding pass. This caused a few problems as was a security breach. The worst was still to come. We boarded the plane and someone was in our seats . We had booked 2 rows behind each other as we could only have 1 baby in each row due to drop down masks. The family said they had been moved as they had a baby and their row had only 3 masks. The hostess then said why do we need these seats so was told we have 2 babies. She proceeded to sit 2 adults and 2 babies on same row leaving middle seat empty. This obviously left 1 of our group with no seat. They constantly asked him to sit down and he told them I would if I had a seat. The reply the plane is full, no more available seats. We asked why can they not find another row with 4 masks and ask people to move so can go back to original 1 baby on row but no one listened until we had to get very annoyed so they called the captain who agreed with us that was the solution. We had left double buggy at entrance to plane and when arrived in Madrid were told it would be on the belt with luggage. After waiting about an hour we had to queue again for another hour at iberia enquiry desk. they couldnt locate it so we were frantic in Madrid with 2 very tired babies by this time and no where to sleep.Eventually we spoke to another security guard who suggested we try excess baggage and thank goodness it was there.

Iberia frauded me,Zurich,Mexico City,International,"I bought a round trip ticket with Iberia. Since my travel plans were uncertain, I intentionally bought a ticket that could be rebooked as well as canceled.

Four weeks before departure, I wanted to cancel my return flight. I initiated a cancellation twice via telephone customer service (online cancellation not possible). Both times I was verbally confirmed that the return flight was cancelled and the money would be transferred in a few days (written confirmation was not possible).

Weeks later I still did not have my money back. Calling customer service again, I was told that the ticket was never canceled and the passenger had not shown up. Therefore, there would be no refund.

They couldn’t give me cash in compensation because they ran out of cash that day.

Then it was back to the very long queue again. Now I was told I wasn’t gonna get home that day, I had to spend a night more in Madrid. Iberia payed for a hotel and for food. The food included was so bad, I went to the restaurant in that hotel and payed myself. Here I was served raw chicken.

They refused to book a hotel for us or to refund us anything for all the trouble we went through because of their mistake! When we arrived at the airport the next day, they asked us to wait to check 1 prior the flight, so we had to wait for hours to find out there are no places again.

The flight was late taking off,  and when I arrived in Lisbon, my boarding pass would inexplicably not  allow me to grant me entry to the ""connecting flights"" infrastructure like almost all of the other passengers arriving from Philadelphia. I had to leave the airport and check in again.

I would have missed the connecting flight, if that flight had not also been late. Coming back from Tel Aviv to Philadelphia, I encountered essentially the same problems (late flights, rude staff who deflected responsibility, lack of coordination with American even though it was Iberia's itinerary).

Iberia could care less about you or your travel plans,London,Madrid,Europe,"Iberia had to cancel a flight of mine direct to Madrid. In the meantime, there was no communication from the staff whatsoever about the delay or steps to take. Additionally, there were no customer service reps present at the airport, only British Airways (who they're associated with). British Airways agents claimed they couldn't help any of us with rebooking our flights or compensation.

Meanwhile, Iberia automatically rebooked our flights (I got notified via text message) to a flight the next day (without consulting me). This flight change was now a day later, at an inconvenient time, and not direct -- going to take 7 hours to get there versus 2. 

According to European law, I am owed compensation yet no one from their customer service team is helping, instead each agent on the phone just passes you off to another agent and so on.

The absolute WORST!! STAY AWAY!!!!,Madrid,London,Europe,"I have never ever experienced such lack of care and poor service from an airline. Bad experience all round, from the moment you walk up to the check-in desks, till the moment you disembark the aircraft. 
Boarding started with no announcements made, and no queueing system in place. Passengers were just supposed to guess where to go. No dedicated line for Business Class. 
On board was even worse. From the moment you step towards the aircraft doors, you are screeched at by the flight manager at the door about wearing a mask, and if you are exempt, god help you, as they are totally uninterested in what you have to say. I heard the crew accuse a passenger with a medical exemption certificate of forgery and making it all up. I could not believe how they were treating passengers. The shouting and barking orders at us as if we were in some military boot camp, and not paying customers. Absolutely awful and disgusting behaviour
Their announcements were mostly in Spanish, and then they switch to English. It would have been better if they didnt, as their English is appalling. You cannot understand a word they are saying, and makes me worry what they would do in an emergency
During meal service, the crew manager would walk up and down the aisle and tell us to hurry up and eat fast so we can put our masks back on. I have never been so disgusted with airline staff
The flight deck seemed to have been hiding away in their cockpit, and didnt even bother to make a welcome announcement, or any other announcement during flight.

(Considering doing the whole booking, the e-ticket, check-in.. it made it very tiring  und we kinda lost patience.) The baggage check-in at the airport… The system, ONLY iberias system didn’t work out of the whole universe..The had to check-in manually and it took FOREVER. People got pi**ed , we were at least patient but the flight delayed 1h , but we made it to the connection flight. Then the seats, we booked row 27 (according to the plan those were two seats behind the bathroom with extra legroom. We paid 200 CHF for those seats and didn‘t get them!!! It was a different airplan and everything was very narrow. On the way back also not, but there at least we were lucky to have again an other airplane that was a little bit more comfortable, but still not the seats we booked and paid for. 
The service was ok… During the shourt flights there was no food, never had that with other airlines .. I expected at least a small snack. On the long flights the food was also ok BUT: If you fligh 8.5h hours and you get food at the very beginning of the flight, aren‘t you hungry again after 7h? For the second meal we got to choose beteeen a banana and a muffin haha omg.. Drinks could also have been brought more often .. not only twice. We had to stand up and ask for it, since we had already drank our own bottles of water.
The toilets in the 1. flight DISGUSTING. Never seen something like that and I work in a hotel and I‘ve seen a lot.

They left me in the middle of a transaction when I requested a return flight change, I got charged and the agent never came back to complete the phone call to assure me that the ticket was in fact sold to me. If you request to talk to a manager they hang on you. Few days later my return flight was canceled. I got in panic and my anguish increased thinking that I was going to miss the ship with this airline cancelling and modifying the flights. They also modified my departure flight . Please stay away from them. I lost money with them. The law protect such despicable service.",April 2022,"May 1, 2022",1.0,,,,,,,,

I immediately checked my carry-on and discovered they had stolen over $20k worth of goods from me. I have been trying to get in touch with Ibera for days but they are impossible to get in touch with.

The given hotline is in Spanish only with no option to switch to English. I called more than ten times and all result in an impolite staff speaking in Spanish and dropped my call. At last, I found my hotel front desk help for translation and the hotline told me the baggage will be delay another day. With no reason again !

I was lost, worried and angry about my baggage delay which certainly ruined my mood of travelling while there was no help given by Iberia at all. 

The baggage however arrived 2 days after the my arrival. 

After back to London, I contacted Iberia again for the compensation of my purchase during the baggage delay period. I contacted the UK office English hotline found on the official website. Once again, there was no support provided, claiming they only handle booking related request and asked me to call the Spanish hotline. At the end, an agent helped me to fire a complaint for me but until now there was still no refund received.

I have been flying them for years and I often wonder if the board of directors (or whoever the leadership is) are really a bunch of goats sitting around a board table eating airline tickets. It's the only logical explanation for a website that does not function (is not translated well at all). You can't do anything really on their website (only put in ""requests"" eg put in a request for a flight change but it won't actually let you change the flight so have fun having your flight cancelled only to not get your request approved and it won't let you even write what flight you want). This essentially forces you to call customer service for which (if you choose English) you will need to wait >30 min to be answered by someone who will tell you they can't help you and give you a phone number for someone who also won't be able to help you. If you choose the Spanish language, prepare for a rude and abrasive customer service representative that will not be helpful at all. I paid for a flex ticket that on the website states and I quote ""First flight change allowed without penalty up to 15 days before flight"". I called to ask for a flight change and they tried to charge me an 80Euro flight penalty. I kept saying that my ticket says I don't have a penalty and the guy ended up canceling my entire itinerary and only providing an 80% refund. I have called over and over and no one can help me.

It's not as simple as paying the difference for the new flight you want.

Problem #2. I originally booked my flights on the American Airlines website and chose a fare which includes one checked bag for free. But Iberia says I will have to pay for my bag because their records show that I have not booked any luggage. Iberia customer service  says to call American Airlines, which confirmed my fare twice. When I called Iberian customer service again, trying to clear this up, the customer service agent hung up on me. 

To call this customer service, is just sad. I never once had the feeling like they wanted to help me.

1- a new route GRU - Madrid - Barcelona - Stuttgart: so many stops are extremely uncomfortable. I also could have bought a cheaper ticket in that conditions

2- a new route GRU - London - Stuttgart: Which I said would be fine, however currently it is necessary to bring a PCR test, which would increase the trip price. So I asked to take this option and if the same conditions remain until the trip day I would like to change it and not stop in London ( free of charge and it was denied).

3- a new route GRU - Frankfurt ( and waiting 10 hours in Madrid): I wasn't really keen on that and I did dot buy it, but I accepted. I also asked to change the flight one day before, since I would need to travel after arriving in Germany, and it was DENIED.

I started getting notices about the flight. I called again and discovered it had never been canceled. They offered to send me a voucher. That never happened either. 
I will never book with them again.

AMS-MAD-EZE in C-Class,Amsterdam,Buenos Aires,International,"March 2022. Seat 3J. Iberia is known for its long distance flights to South America and we were expecting service and reliability. Flying with Iberia became a mediocre experience.

On the 13-hour MAD-EZE Atlantic crossing, Iberia was flying EC-NBR (first flight May 2019), a A359 in 1-2-1 configuration. Seating in C-class is a flatbed seat with 78 Bed-length (1981mm) and 26 Width. The aircraft is top-of-the-bill.

The flight was on time. With a number of flights for South America leaving at midnight the lounge in MAD appeared crowded. Entertainment on the board is fine with large screen, a pillow, blanket and no under-blanket. To our surprise in C-Class no voucher for internet use is offered. You have to buy internet for use on the flight.

Service was friendly but not very attentive. The purser hardly mastered English and her announcements in English were incomprehensible. At 00:40 dinner was served. We skipped dinner and went to sleep. To be fair, this is what we need. An OK sleep on a 10.000km flight is more important than a posh late dinner plus drinks.

Not sure that we will fly Iberia again. Air Europa has a wide choice of destinations to South America and offers in C-Class a better service.",March 2022,"March 25, 2022",3.0,,,,,,,,
Baggage delayed and still not delivered 4 days later,Charlotte,Madrid,International,"Somehow my luggage ended up in Madrid 24 hours after I did. Over the last four days I have been on the phone over 12 hours trying to get my luggage. It was supposed to be delivered the first day but they tried once and I was using prebooked tickets to a museum. Arranged a new time to deliver when I'd be there and they never showed up and I haven't been called since, so I kept calling. Airline said they have no idea who the delivery company is because they subcontract it, so asked to talk to a supervisor-- call center workers are not allowed to transfer to supervisors. So had to go back to the airport and spend half a day of my vacation trying to get this sorted out. Been in linenfor over an hour and as of right now still waiting. Apparently they lost luggage for an entire flight. Lots of angry people waiting in line. I just hope I actually get my bag so I can enjoy last 4 days of my trip.",March 2022,"March 24, 2022",1.0,,,,,,,,
Appalling - refuse refunds for cancelled flights,London,Raleigh,International,"Tldr; Never ever book with Iberia, they cancelled my flights last minute and are refusing to refund me over £1,700.

I booked flights with Iberia for April 2021. Understandably these flights were cancelled.

The website made it impossible to request a refund and there is no way of speaking to a human over the phone, so I ended up accepting vouchers which I had to obtain via Twitter.

I used the vouchers to book flights for March 2022 (less good flights with layovers that were more expensive).

In February 2022, I received an email to say the return flight was cancelled.

I asked for a refund through Twitter and was advised this had been agreed. I therefore booked a single ticket back with a different airline.

4 days before my outbound flight was due, I received an email with log in information for check in etc. As the log in details didn’t work, yet again I had to contact them through Twitter.

This was how I found out not only had my outbound flight also been cancelled, but they had not given me an actual refund and instead just put the money back on the vouchers. Vouchers which expire in March 2022 🙃

For further context, the reason for our trip was to visit bereaved family members, which I explained to Iberia several times.

Besides, the so promoted wifi on board was not available at all, not even by paying. 
I’m also terribly sorry to admit the staff on board is totally absent; calls buttons are basically ignored till that I couldn’t neither get water during the whole flight. Don’t even let me started with the quality of meals and service, during dinner I had to repeat myself several time, to different hostess, for a beverage that in fact I did not get; while during breakfast, I chosen to drink a glass of orange juice, and I was stared at because I also asked for the glass of water I was dreaming of for literally hours.

Worst customer service EVER !,New York City,London,International,"My husband and I booked tickets to fly to London June 2020 returning from Florence, Italy July 2020 for a family reunion in Tuscany in a prepaid Villa, the flight was cancelled by Iberia due to the pandemic and I was issued a voucher for future use the following year.
The Villa company would not let us return the following July and kept our deposit so I asked for an extension to July 2022, I was given an extension but only to April 2022 which did not do me any good as the Villa is booked for July. I have been calling for months to get another extension but to no avail, I get representatives who don’t speak English and have been hung up on repeatedly, after being on hold for up to an hour.

Awful cabin crew and paid for seats allocated to other passengers,Santiago,Madrid,International,"First problem - we paid for certain seats which, when boarding, had been allocated to others.  So a window seat turned out to be a non-window seat. We have complained using their formal system to be told we were in the right seats despite sending them copies of documents.  

Second problem - My wife has a severe nut allergy. The only meal offered on this (thirteen hour) flight was a meal that the cabin stewardess couldn't check for any nut content (or frankly coudn't be bothered) as she shrugged her shoulders and moved on.   We were given one small bottle of wine each.

Third problem - The flight was very smooth but the captain saw fit to stick on the seat belt signs for hours.  So the lazy cabin crew did not come round with any drinks - not even water to those who did not or could not sleep.  

Fourth problem - We were given a muffin as a snack after hours of flying.  One of the cabin crew member was asked again about any nut content. He said 'Dont
eat it then'   How bad was that response???  We were fuming.  

Fifth problem - blocked washhand basin which was not attended for hours and finally

.... the sixth problem - my tray was filthy at the hinges.

We booked this through a travel agent and through BA with their partnership with Iberia.
Frankly the Iberia team that day were a disgrace, they were rude, unhelpful and  lazy.  No smiles and it looked like their team didn't want to be there.

I had three emails from Iberia, one to change our seats (and suggest i redid boarding passes ha ha) and the other 2 about check in for return flight. As they were all in Spanish I could only guess they were for check in, I clicked on an obvious link and got an error so gave up.

Coming to the check in counter, the lady said we are too late I had to do the check-in 45min prior to my flight so let’s do the math: Arrival 6:55pm the flight was at 7.55pm that’s exactly 1hour and we wanted to check-in at 7.05pm which still gave me 50mins to be on time and wait for the boarding! But unfortunately they insisted that I was too late! Then they told my boyfriend due to the fact that my spanish isn’t that great, that I could go through security with my luggage and tell them I couldn’t board, so they will put it in under the airplane and give it to me once we landed in Zurich!

Bizarre booking experience,Venice,Madrid,Europe,"Most bizarre and ridiculous booking experience.   I purchased a ticket on their website that was listed in Euro (112.6 Euro), but then got the receipt, which was in pound (112.6 Sterling).  I am from the USA and that resulted in approximately $20 difference.  Twenty dollars was not much to get worked up about, but it was so absurd that I had to call.   After much back on forth with representative, I was told I would be credited the difference.  However, when I got my credit card bill a month later, I realized that the representative had actually given me a credit for 112.6 Euro.  That drove me to the website to see if I still had my ticket.  Sure enough, my booking no longer existed.   So basically I ending up paying $20 to not have a ticket and by this time tickets had almost doubled in price.  At this point, I have spent hours on the phone trying to get this issue resolved.  Even if the mistake is so obvious, the customer representatives have resisted doing anything about it.  Finally, after much nagging, they agreed to look further into it and get back to me in a week.  In the meantime, no ticket.   A fiction writer could not have come up with a more bizarre set of circumstances.   Finally, I just bought another ticket since otherwise I would be stranded and hope they will reimburse me back to original price plus the $20 difference.  We will have to see…….

We are still stuck in Bogota at the moment. Local staff is completely unhelpful and I doubt that any of this is legal.

  They can overbook, deny boarding and provide you a microwaved dinner and substandard hotel and that’s it.

One of the worst airlines !,Seville,Zurich,Europe,"Firstly, on 15 Jan 22, my friend and I had successfully checked in at the counter in Seville and each of us received two tickets to Zurich, transiting via Madrid. The staff had also make sure all the needed documents were ready for the trips - both from Seville to Madrid and Madrid to Zurich. 
But with a big surprise, while we reached the gate in Madrid for the transit, we were told by the boarding staff that we were missing the COVID negative test result and we could not board at the very last minute before the gate was closing. 
Given that a rapid test is only possible at the departure (and not in the transit zone), it was impossible for us to take the flight. We could only rebook the return flight on another day. However, we found the staff was not correct and we could have taken the original flight to Zurich and also made the test at the arrival according to Switzerland official website. 

Secondly, adding salt on the wound, on 17 Jan 22, Iberia had created another trouble in my journey back. The counter numbers indicated on the official check-in TV board for the Zurich flight were apparently dedicated to the guests who have already completed check in and need to drop off their luggage! After lining up for 15 minutes, its staff had asked us to go to other counters which were not shown on the official board!

More importantly, a male staff at the check in counter at 530pm had given me a wrong boarding pass! He was very unprofessional and careless. I needed to run back to the counter for help as I have only realised the boarding pass was invalid at the security gate.

The experience are unacceptable and the troubles Iberia  has created could have been avoided. The frustrations and problems it brought had costed us mentally and financially.",January 2022,"February 16, 2022",1.0,,,,,,,,

One of the biggest disappointments,New York City,Porto,International,Ibéria is by far one of the poorest run airlines of the developed world.  Their lack of customer service paired with indifferent and pretentious attitude is not only demeaning but it lacks basic human decency at times.  I vowed to never fly them again 4 years ago and this week due to a family emergency it was literally the only airline that had a schedule that allowed me to arrive in Europe on time to attend services.  It’s disappointing because it’s hub location could make it an incredible connection hub for all of Europe but I would rather fly further out and then backwards than to engage in business with them.   It’s even sadder because the Spanish culture by nature isn’t condescending and rude this is truly a corporate culture issue as it is the same even in the embarkation points outside of Spain.

Iberia is HORRIBLE,Miami,Madrid,International,"I booked a flight in February for Novemeber. Admittedly, I booked a non refundable flight. 3 days later I notice I clicked on the wrong day. Iberia wouldn't do anything to help accommodate. I know the flight was non refundable, but I booked 3 days ago for a flight 10 months from the time I called. I offered to pay a fee and the ticket difference.  The customer service was not helpful at all. They told me it was impossible to speak with anyone else about this, but after an hour I was transferred to a manager, who hung up on me. I was nice and polite the whole time, I know it wasn't their fault. Again I know I booked the wrong flight on a non refundable ticket, but I would imagine a little bit of help. The flight I was trying to change was actually an American Airlines flight. I called American and they said they couldn't do anything sinve it was booked through Iberia, but the lady told me that if this was American, they would've made the change for me pretty easily with being 2 days from cancellation and 10 months until the flight.

A Nightmare from Beginning to End,London,Montevideo,International,"My fiance and I travelled from LHR to Montevideo ten days ago. The nightmare started when the airline refused the documentation my fiance, a British national, had uploaded onto their website as required by the airline and the Uruguayan authorities. This culminated in the absurd situation of my fiance and I waiting in front of the unmanned Iberia counter for hours on end, trying to get a hold of someone on their customer service line. When staff arrived, it took them about twenty minutes to get the check-in counter running despite the enormous queue that had built up. They finally allowed him to travel, however.

Upon arriving to our connecting flight in Madrid, we received a text message--inexplicably in French--telling us to urgently go to our gate to verify documentation, despite there being more than an hour to go before the advertised boarding time. They then made all passengers queue for over an hour whilst they looked perplexed at the process of boarding a plane and didn't check any documentation beyond the standard boarding pass and passport that we're used to from before the days of Covid.

When we get on the plane, the stewardesses pretend they have no room to hang up my wedding dress, until the lack of overhead luggage space calls them on their bluff and they are forced to hang my dress.

The icing on the cake was upon our arrival to Montevideo, where I discovered that my suitcase had never made it. I have now been waiting for any update on my suitcase whatsoever for 10 days. No information since the day of the incident and no indication that anything has been done to find my suitcase, despite my calling their customer service line in Spain nearly daily, at great personal expense. I can't say I look forward to fighting over the money they owe me for clothes and toiletries I've had to purchase since I've arrived-- not to mention that the fact that my luggage contained things like the shoes I'm wearing to my wedding and books impossible to find in Uruguay and that I need in order to work here has not moved any one in Iberia one iota.",January 2022,"February 7, 2022",1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0

I was on the phone to customer service the whole time and I explained that the pilot is refusing to show me his ID.

I told him i am on the phone to customer service and they are asking me your name it’s not like I’ve done something wrong or it’s illegal to ask someone for verification.

Customer service is one thing to write comments about but having to resort to a review site on a matter of safety is a disgrace.

In addition, Barcelona Airport (T 1) is pleasant and airy, which added to the positive ambiance in attempts to maintain social distancing to fellow passengers. 

Iberia operates daily flights from Madrid and Barcelona for Finnair (AY flight number with Iberia aircraft, crew and catering); the usual European service with the middle seat empty, similar legroom to economy, no AVOD nor small monitors.

Worst experience of our life!!!!,Bilbao,Hamburg,Europe,"Please everyone, read this carefully! And please do share this with as many people as you can, especially if you have a dog and Babys travelling with you. I have posted this  on as many social media platforms as I could hoping that no one has to go through what we went through yesterday. 

We have been loyal members of Iberia. We always  booked flights with them, even most of the flights are being routed to Madrid first before going to the final destination. Like Bilbao-Madrid-Lisbon, instead of booking Bilbao-Lisbon with a cheaper alternative. We just loved their service and their always on time flights. Until yesterday.... We are now cancelling our credit cards we have with them and our membership as well. Good bye Avios, welcome Miles and More...

So what happened was this: we flew more than once with our dog. So we knew the procedure. You book a flight, you make a call and they ask you to call back 72hrs later. It sounds weird that it takes this long, but it always worked and we thought this is just how things are handled at Iberia. So we called on Monday 27th (flight was booked on the 24th, but we couldnt reach the hotline, which is normal cause it was christimas and decided to call on Monday the 27th instead). We spoke to a nice lady who helped us make the request- they ask you a bunch of questions about the dog, weight race etc. Then basically, they ask you to call back again three days later. Not earlier. Business as usual we thought. In case they would have told us on Thursday the  30th that the dog couldnt be on the plane, we still would have had time to reschedule the flight and just try another flight... 

So we called again on Thursday and to our surprise, we were told there is no request for a dog... 

After discussing this with the call center agent, she decided to make another request. I told her the flight was the next day. And she told me there is nothing else she could do and that we should try it. I dont get why she wasnt honest and just told us to rebook??! Both of these calls were recorded! So we have proof!

When we arrived at the airport in Bilbao, the lady at the counter told us she can see the request and they could handle the dog in cargo BUT there needs to be at least one hour between the connecting flights. We only had 55minutes. Iberia seems to need this additional 5 minutes, which are of course are essential!, to transport the dog from one plane to another. Why did the customer service representative did not tell us that???!!! I DONT GET IT!!! 

Instead, we were insulted by everyone possible at the airport, especially from the supervisor lady at the Airport in Bilbao, who kept saying we never called on Monday- I LOVED IT!! CALLING BUSINESS CLIENTS LIARS- WONDERFUL JOB! I asked for her name, and she told me she wouldnt give me her name and turned around her name tag :) And kept running away when we tried to talk cause I think she noticed we tried to record her with our phones... which we did of course. 

On top of that, we got 3999 new informations on how to handle bookings with a dog- all of the IBERIA workers saying different things. One said they need notice 24hrs, the other 48hrs etc etc. We didnt know if we should laugh or cry. 
It was my husbands birthday and we drove home- PAYING OURSELVES FOR A RENTAL CAR!!!!- crying during the whole ride. 

You guys think this is all??? NO! Iberia told us we have to pay 90EUR cancellation fees... so on top of all that, we will not receive the full amount back. 

This company is calling loyal customers liars, charge them and insult them! 

Not acceptable. We are in touch with various companies, one of them airclaim, to see if we can get back those 90EUR and the money we paid for the rental car. We have cancelled our credit cards with them, told everyone to avoid them, especially family and friends on every channel possible, and will also cancel our Silver membership. 

You have lost us forever, Iberia. We fly a lot, and we have never experienced this kind of thing. NEVER. 

Good bye forever and we hope to never, NEVER, see you again.",December 2021,"January 1, 2022",1.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
Good flight as usual,Canton of Geneva,Guayaquil,International,"Good flight with Iberia as usual. Plane was on time, check-in and boarding procedures was very efficient despite all the covid checks that needed to be done. Onboard service was more then correct. 
The only thing that should really improve is the cleanness of the toilets. The crew should make an effort to keep them clean because during this 12 hours flight they look really disgusting and it gives a really poor image of this airline.

Iberia scammers & worst client support ever,Amsterdam,Malaga,Europe,"First, I had to cancel previous flights due to covid from what I got some redeemable codes. Those codes could only be used on Iberia, even if the same flight in Vueling is 50% cheaper you need to book it on Iberia. Even though I feel like a retarded person paying more for the same flight I had a code to spend. The flight did not cost the total amount I had in my code, which I was going to use to book some seats as I'm 198cm myself and these planes are tuna cans. To my surprise, check-in is done on Vueling which means that my whole plan went to the garbage as the codes and money I have sitting on Iberia cannot be used on Vueling.

Trying to fix this issue with customer support, I call once Iberia Express getting hung up by the automatic answers without speaking to a real person, the same result after calling Iberia customer support and 5min on the phone waiting for nothing. After this, I decided to try the WhatsApp chat, which take me 10 min to make the automatic answers formulary to understand my problem, and when I finally get a real person on my chat, I get as an answer one line saying: ""the code can only be used on Iberia"". They never answer again or say anything else, I was so angry that I deleted the chat to do not remember that ever happened.

In conclusion, I could easily say that Iberia is even worst than Ryanair, at least there I know what I get for the money. Iberia don't care about any customer, does not matter the amount of money you pay, and customer support is the worst I have seen in my life.",December 2021,"December 29, 2021",1.0,,,,,,,,

After spending thousands, they wouldn’t let me select my seat, in first class, because their app doesn’t work. Their website doesn’t work. If you call they try to rob you of €24 to select a seat. One representative even told me yeah we know it doesn’t work, it’s extra revenue! Can you believe that? Another one hung up on me. The other was just rude. There was no information on the flight either until THE LAST SECOND. I am a frequent international flyer, and I can say this is the worst airline in the world.

The worst airline ever!!!,Madrid,Miami,International,"Iberia is the most dysfunctional airline in the industry.  Not only do their people not speak English well enough to understand and communicate, but their customer service is the WORST!!

We booked a trip to Italy through American and the outbound flight was very good (British Airways), but the return was a nightmare.  First our flight from Italy to London on British Airways was cancelled the day before we were scheduled to leave.  British Airways could not help re-book, we had to do it through AA.  AA booked us on an Iberia flight from Italy to Madrid and Madrid to Miami.  Everything seems good until I could not check in online.  I called Iberia, they assigned seats, I paid for the upgrade and was told we would have to check in at the airport..ok no problem we thought.  We get to the airport, stand in line and finally get to the counter...the lady checks me in but says she can't find my wife's reservation, even though we have seats assigned...I have to get out of line and call AA.  They find that the Iberia agent booked me on the Madrid to Miami flight, but booked my wife on British Airways from Madrid to London!!!  AA had to cancel the entire reservation and re-book us, which meant that we lost the seats we had upgraded to.  Got back in line and back to the agent who now found the new reservation and gave us our boarding passes in economy...fine at least we will get home.   10 hours later we arrive in Miami (thursday night) and guess what, two of our four bags don't show up!!  File a claim, the guy finds the bags (still in Madrid) and says they will be in Miami on Friday and we will have them delivered within 28 hours..  It is now Weds and still no bags.  Called Iberia customer service everyday and get the same story...your bags got to Miami on Friday and should be delivered but we cant tell you when...No one to escalate to, no way to get any additional information.

IBERIA has the worst reputation in the Airlines industry, so my first tought to fly from madrid to london was British Airways, but I didnt know they now own Iberia, big mistake! I went to the airport and realized the mistake I made not checking this, and my worst nightmaires came true, as my luggage never arrived! after waiting 2 hours, I talked to British Airways because theres no Iberia staff in Heathrow!!! The made me fill up a form and told me to go home that my luggage will be with me the next day. Three days after no sign of the luggage, they found one piece that is in delivery but hasent arrived and the other suitcase they dont have any idea were it is.

Customer Service,London,Madrid,Europe,Very unpleasant customer service experience with Iberia. My original flight from LA was delayed and meant I would miss my Iberia connection. Rather than wait for London I called Iberia 3 times as this was my connection flight and where my luggage was being routed through for Madrid. I was told all three times I would need to wait for my arrival to London as other airlines were involved and they would not assist me. One representative Ana Castillo was particularly unpleasant. When I requested 7 times to speak with a manager she refused. Avoid this airline if you would like or expect any level of customer service.

When I filed a formal complaint received an email back saying I can expect to hear back from Iberia airlines in 7 business days. To make matters worse the luggage contained kitesurfing equipment and vital medication amongst other things, meaning that I am having to pay $95/day as well as a large fee for replacement medicine. I have been offered no compensation and the representative at the airport doesn't respond to my emails or phone calls despite giving me his direct phone number.

RipOFF,Santo Domingo,London,International,"2 Month dream stay in the DR, I thought let me play safe and purchase to change of flight, due to covid and government unpredictability.  I also require extra luggage and even squeezed in upgrade to Business class. So turned out I needed to change return date as this is what I paid for while out on my dream holiday. This is where is gets ugly.

Rang the local Iberia number in the DR, only to be told, no evidence of change of flight. I rang repeatedly and spent at least £15 on calls. Was given an email address by numerous staff, to show my receipt of purchase none of which worked as they all bounced back.  Eventually I gave up and spent another £30 on international calls to to get my option to change my fight. They then gave me a date I didn't want. So I swallowed the pain of spending all that money to get this actioned. Not only are the staff useless, the systems tie their hands to their backs, making the passengers suffer. 
On return, after printing my boarding pass I noticed my extra luggage was missing. I had to call back with disgust only for them to tell me they cant see it on their systems. eventually the staff dropped the phone on me again and had to call back and was told to hold. Waited 10 minutes before I could eventually spend another 17 minutes to pay for a service I already had paid for. 

Never again, I emailed customer service about my experience and got a template letter for my efforts, the case was closed. Once I get home, I am deleting all Iberia marketing, apps and any trace of this company. I am scarred for life. They will never see my money again. Stay away.

Iberia Customer Service..NOT,New York City,Madrid,International,"Review of Trip to Spain
11/19-26

Let me preface my remarks that we are a septuagenarian couple who have traveled extensively to Europe for over 30 years.  This trip was our high school senior grandson’s which allows us a week of one-on-one time with him. 

We booked our trip through Costco Travel; our first time to do so.  The trip included flights to Madrid, Spain, a high speed train to Barcelona, and the flight back to the US with hotel and transfer to and from the airport.  In addition via Tripadvisor/Viator we booked some excursions: HoponHopoff bus in Madrid and Avila and Segopvia, the Prada Museum and Royal Palace; and Montserrat and Sagrada Familia in Barcelona. 

We flew with American Airlines to JFK in New York and there via American Airlines we flew Iberia Airlines to Madrid.  We typically fly Premium Economy on the long flights to allow us to sleep on the way over.  However, due to an error on both our parts, we only received upgraded economy which is only a little more leg room.  Uncomfortable seating, etc.  For those who fly you know the drill.  

Our Iberia departure was a 1 hour delay with a half-hour delayed arrival.  Nothing unusual but remember we booked hotel transfers.  After we arrived we waited about 45 minutes for our luggage to find our luggage was lost!  We asked and was guided to the Iberia customer service center and arrived to a relatively short line.   There were about 4 agents handling the customers. 

I was concerned about our driver so I went to make sure he was there and explained our luggage was lost and I had to fill our the forms, etc.  My wife and grandson stayed with him while I returned to Iberia customer service.  It took me an HOUR to get to the customer service representative and another half hour to fill out the paperwork.  I explained that our cold weather clothes were in our suitcases and we would need to purchase some clothing, etc.  To my dismay he gave me a print out with a telephone number to call...TOMORROW!  That they would not provide any vouchers, etc until tomorrow!!  Perhaps customer service but certainly NOT customer care.  In addition our driver demanded 60 euros cash for his time. Uuggh.  

So instead off getting on the HOHO bus we trotted to stores to get coats, hats, toiletries, etc.  It was so late by then the museums, etc were closing and the HOHO bus stopped at 6 pm. 

We stayed at the NH Collection Suecia in Madrid.  It was very nice, great location,  and the staff very helpful and helped direct us to some stores to buy clothes, etc.  While we speak a little Spanish (Our grandson had taken 3 years of Spanish and was a great help) we certainly are not fluent.  I called the number given me by Iberia customer service to see if there were any updates.  I had received a text message that they had located our luggage and it was being sent to the airport.  Where it went before we never found out.   I called the number and listened to a Spanish recording, but it was so fast I couldn’t understand nor could our grandson.  I was listening for an English option but there was none.  Regardless, we felt our luggage would arrive the next day; little did we know it would not. 

The next morning we went to catch the HOHO bus near the hotel.  We waited, and waited some more.  No bus.  We finally decided to walk, in the cold to the Prada. It is a great museum; overwhelming in fact.   You can not go wrong going there but plan for a lot of time.  We could have easily spent the whole day there and still not have seen it all. 

We then went to the HOHO stop right beside the Prada.  We waited and waited some more. No bus. We even asked several personnel near the museum and they all said that is where it stops.  I noticed a HOHO bus stop near by but never made it to our stop.  So we trekked over to that stop and waited and waited some more.  FYI, we learned that they had changed their schedule but never notified us nor did they post any signs at the stops. Even the kiosks which sell the HOHO tickets didn’t know!!  Anyway, while we have always used the HOHO to get around cities, etc. these were worthless.  They even stopped the buses going to some of the major attractions in Madrid such as the Royal Palace!  A total waste of TIME and money.  The time was the greatest loss. We did use the HOHO bus to get near the Royal Palace but that was the only time.  We never even toured the whole route.

The Royal Palace is fabulous and again well worth a visit. Don’t miss the armory though; it too is fabulous.  Although you can’t take pictures in most of the Palace they have a great book in the store, Royal Palace of Madrid.  It is well worth purchasing.  It is at the Royal Palace HOHO stop that we found out(after about 30 minutes) they had eliminated several stops including this one.  ???unbelievable. So we used Uber and taxis the rest of our stay. They were quick to respond and relatively inexpensive, certainly not as inexpensive as the HOHO bus or public transportation.  Note: we often use public transportation when we travel but with such a short time we wanted to maximize our time and waiting for buses or metros was considered to time consuming.  In hindsight we would have been better off to use it.

After the Palace we returned to our hotel with the expectation our luggage would be there. It wasn’t.  I asked the concierge to call for me and ask where our luggage was and about reimbursement for our clothes, etc.  He was able to determine that our luggage was in Madrid and would probably arrive that evening; but nothing on the reimbursement.  Note that we had received no such information via text from Iberia.  So we went to dinner and had a nice evening.  Getting back to the hotel we found...no luggage.  This proved to be very problematic as we had no time to go buy any additional clothing. 

The next day we had our excursion to  Ávila and Segovia.  As we traveled by bus we noticed the outside temperature drop from 9 C to 0 C.  When we arrive at Avila it was actually snowing, which normally would be a delight, but with the clothing we had we were freezing, especially my wife.  The tour was great and we highly recommend it.  Our guide was fabulous...am I using that too much? But she was.  We had a great lunch in Avila; I had their famous large bean soup; highly recommended. 

Afterwards we traveled to Segovia and I decided to give my wife some of my clothing and I stayed behind.  I had some nice cups of tea at a local cafe but I would have rather been on the tour. My wife and grandson did have a wonderful time again.  Again our guide was fabulous.  While I was at the cafe I called the hotel about our luggage and eureka it had arrived!  Since we were leaving the next day for Barcelona it was very important to us.  However, once again nothing about reimbursement from Iberia or any text message that they had delivered our luggage.  Extremely poor customer service and certainly no customer care at all.   

The next day we departed the hotel to take the high speed train to Barcelona.  Everything was very easy; easy to get to the station, easy to locate the gate, easy to find our car and seats thanks to the staff.  Ride was very nice with some nice scenery including snow on the ground!  We had lunch on board and just had a very nice trip.  My only complaint is that we wanted to leave early to arrive in Barcelona in time to visit some sites.  As it was we departed at 1 pm and arrived about 4 pm.  By the time we arrived at the hotel the day was pretty lost. 

We stayed at the NH Collection Podium, again a very nice hotel and location.  The next day we strolled Las Ramblas in the misty rain; but later as we walked the Rambla de Catalunya
and the Gothic Quarter it began to rain hard!  By the time we arrived back at the hotel we were soaked!  Fortunately we had our luggage and was able to change.  We met that evening with a pastor friend and had dinner and attended his church.  It was a great way to spend an evening. 

The next day we traveled to Montserrat leaving with Explore Catalunya.  Our guide Robert was great or should I say fabulous. They were well organized and allowed us some free time.  If you’ve never been to Montserrat(we actually had) it is really quite incredible.  We took the funicular to the top of the mountain as well as walked to the Cross of Saint Michael.  Afterward we headed to the Sagrada Familia.  It had been several years since we had visited and they have accomplished a lot.  It is due to be completed in 2026.  Again, fabulous.  It is so extraordinary that someone could have such a vision yet alone have it constructed.  Just beautiful and wrought with symbolism.

The next day we left to return to the US via American Airlines.  Due to some mixup again we had what they said were premium economy seats but not what I had hoped for.  We managed and the flight was uneventful; customs and passport control were easy(we have GOES). Our luggage had arrived –eureka and was easily rechecked to our home destination.  Our only complaint was the 7 hour layover in Miami.  But even after booking I looked for options and there really were none. 

All in all, a week with our grandson was priceless and worth any aggravations that occurred.  I am sure he will remember it all his life --- unfortunately the good and the bad. 

It will be interesting to see how Iberia and perhaps American Airlines responds as I will copy them on the letter as well.",November 2021,"November 29, 2021",2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
The worst flight experience ever,Sao Paulo,Madrid,International,"1. As we had a long trip, and short holiday time, we paid a bit extra for a flight with good short connections (as we had to take 3 planes). The flight was cancelled and our only option was another trip with over 15h airport waiting time (but the price was the same as the previous flight).
2. As they messed-up the flight, I couldn't check-in before getting to the airport, so my husband and I had to take separate seats, as they told us there were no 2 seats next to each other available.
3. I also couldn't book my vegetarian meal in advance - so I couldn't really have breakfast, as it was covered in ham.
4. At the plane nobody wanted to change seats, so my husband and I couldn't stay together (which is ok, happens...). Surprisingly, there were 4 seats in a row available just next to us (so ppl in the check-in must have lied before). But we were told we could not move there, as the flight attendants had just reserved for another couple that asked - yes - the 4 seats.
5. At my seat, I found out it was broken and it wouldn't recline even one milimiter - quite something for an 8+ hour flight.

I enter the flight and ask two attendants if it would be possible to take my bag back, they both replied with horrible excuses like the cabins are full, the bags already gone to check-in(even though people were waiting behind me). I proceed to find my seat and low and behold the cabin above my seat is empty and the one across from me too except for one suitcase, the cherry on top, it’s the suitcase of the couple that was in front of me.

Masks over nose and mouth, stay seated after landing means stay seated, and they managed to do all of this with a smile. I am really impressed and happy with my experience with Iberia.

I'd like to add that Iberia implemented a new strategy of queing while boarding in Madrid that really helped to get the passengers on board faster. Loved seeing that in action, I guess I'm a geek like that, but who cares!

Complete Chaos in Madrid,Madrid,Malaga,Domestic,"awful experience we had yesterday at Madrid Airport. We arrived from Dubai and had a IBERIA flight from Madrid to Malaga. The check in process was absolutely chaotic. Limited staff to help. The majority of your customers including us were confused about where to queue and how to check in. We had already checked in online so went straight to the desk and after waiting 1 hour to arrive to the bag drop we were told we needed to use the machines to print the baggage ticket.  We went to use the machines and had to queue another 30 minutes, the machine would not accept my ticket and kept telling me I had to pay 60€ to check in my bag and error messages. After approaching a staff member for help he shouted at me and told me he was busy and to sort it out myself. I ended up having to queue again at the customer service desk which is right in the middle of all the check in machines, social distancing impossible, people pushing and getting irate. such a small area for the amount of passengers you are handling.

"Terribly incompetent, in-flexible airline",London,Madrid,Europe,"Iberia has to be the most unaccommodating airline I have ever had the misfortune of engaging with.
First of all, if you’re flying with the express airline of Iberia, then good luck trying to speak to anyone unless you’re in Spain and happen to be Spanish. 
The Iberia customer agents don’t seem to have any understanding about their own policies nor the policies of their express airlines service.

I booked a flight with Iberia express as I wanted to take my small dog with me in the Cabin to Madrid from London. Iberia express seemed to be the only airline that would permit pets on this particular route, Whilst normal Iberia airline does not.
 After spending many hours trying to get hold of customer service and being kept on hold whilst they find out the answer to every simple question, they finally approved my dog to travel in the cabin with me.

HOWEVER, something told me to do a little more research and triple check every would go to plan, which is when I realised that the flight I was booked on was to be operated by Iberia and NOT Iberia express. Meaning, I would have turned up at the check in desk on the day of flight and have been refused to board with my dog - Despite the fact that I booked with Iberia express AND had a member of staff approve my dog on the flight?!
So, I call up again, explain the situation. Yes, my theory is correct, I would indeed be refused to board with my dog as the flight is being operated by Iberia. No, Iberia express doesn’t even fly this route. No, they will not refund me a single penny for their own incompetence.

So, £150 in the toilet. And an extra £300 I won’t get back for all my dogs travel documents, which I will have to pay for again as I have now missed my 10 day window to leave the country. (Another ridiculous policy thanks to brexit)",November 2021,"November 13, 2021",1.0,,,,,,,,

Madness at MADrid Airport,Madrid,New York City,International,"Had a crazy experience at Madrid airport yesterday.  We left for the airport 4 hours before our flight and made it with 2 minutes to spare.  The big hangup (after the hour-long wait to check in) was Spain's Border Control - only 2 agents to clear hundreds of people.  We waited over 90 minutes to get through, and we were lucky - the wait got much worse behind us.  When people who were about to miss their flights tried to cut in line, the crowd got ugly.  There was lots of shouting, pushing and shoving, and one fist fight very nearly broke out.  It felt very unsafe, mainly because there was no security whatsoever; very Lord of the Flies.  Technically, this wasn't Iberia's fault . . . but it kind of was.  Iberia is the state airline and the largest one at Madrid.  They could get this problem fixed if they wanted too; clearly, they don't really care.  So, if you have to fly international through Madrid, I would suggest leaving LOTS and LOTS of time to get through the jungle.

Worst experience of my entire life,Menorca,Philadelphia,International,"This was the worst flight experience of my entire life. Iberia booked the connecting flights with a one hour layover in Madrid airport. We landed in a terminal that was a 20 minute bus ride from the departing terminal and had to go through passport control, which only had two employees working it. We could not find any Iberia employees to help us move through the process faster. Even with running through the airport I could not make the flight. Over 40 people from the first flight did not make the connecting flight and the gate was completely empty when I got there, just one minute after scheduled departure time. It was impossible to find a customer service desk and every Iberia employee I found was not only unhelpful but straight up mean. I found 3 employees in the airport who simply would not give me directions to the customer service desk because it was ""not their job"". When I found customer service she was one of the meanest people I  have ever dealt with. She kept saying it was my fault and seem bothered to be talking to me at all. Despite the fact that all customers from the connecting flight did not make it, Iberia said it was the customers fault. I was stuck in Madrid for 24 hours and had to book a hotel room with no financial compensation what so ever. When I finally made it back to my end destination my luggage was not there. I have tried to call Iberia about 30 times and it automatically hangs up after 15 minutes. I finally got through to someone today who was rude and unhelpful. She would not tell me where my luggage was or even look up my bag tag number. She also refused to transfer me to someone else. I have been home for 5 days now, with my essentials and entire wardrobe in that suitcase. It is seeming like I will not get my luggage back ever or receive any compensation for the loss. I have not received a single apology from a customer service representative throughout all of this. As a frequent traveler I never imagined an airline would put their customers in situations like this one or treat them so horribly.",October 2021,"November 3, 2021",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
Pretty awful,Ibiza,Dublin,Europe,"I made a reservation for Ibieria with a connection in Madrid in order to save a lot of hassle dragging my bags through connecting airports. It has now turned into a big headache.

It says on the website to add extra baggage this can be done online in the manage booking. Yet only after making the reservation I see that there is no option to do so. Whats more lots of their website links do not work such as the link in the email they sent me to ""add more baggage"". This is apparently because the second part of my trip is operated by Aer Lingus.

I have tried calling Iberia 5 times but the phone cuts out after waiting for about 15 minutes as ""all the agents are busy and to avoid longer waiting times to please call back in a few minutes"". There is no email address to contact them.

They only came through the alley once directly after the plane took off, gave us food and took the rubbish afterwards for 9 hours they were sat in the back chatting and shouting didn’t come around even once. People had to go ask for drinks or snacks and they were just told of to go sit back down! For 9 hours you had to stay sat down without any of them actually at least going through and asking if anyone needs anything. One hour before landing they came again and very stressfully gave out food running around to make it before the plane lands. Didn’t even have enough time to collect rubbish.

The worst company with the worst crew that I have ever seen in my life!,Bogota,Madrid,International,"I would like to write you this letter of complaint following a very serious chain of events that occurred on flight number 6586 that took off from Bogota on 18.10 at 21:15. As part of it, I received disgraceful treatment from some of the air crew on the plane, an attitude I have never received in all the last 20 years I have flown (including many flights with Iberia).

During boarding the plane I noticed that a mother with her two children were sitting in me and my boyfriend’s seats. I drew the attention of the flight attendant, Mrs. M.A. Martinez, who in turn began a conversation with the mother in order for her to vacate the place. I was about to start to tell Mrs. Martinez that I don’t mind to give up my seats in order for the mother to seat with her children but  Mrs. Martinez did not bring me to complete the sentence and raised her voice to me (in Spanish) that I would wait patiently. When I told her I did not speak Spanish and asked her to speak English, she shouted rudely, ""This is Colombia and we speak Spanish."" Throughout the conversation, Mrs. Martinez refused to speak to me in English and explain the situation to me, on the contrary, she kept screaming at me in Spanish sentences that I did not understand and thus humiliated me in front of all the passengers.

Unfortunately, a serious incident in itself did not end and even escalated. A few minutes later I approached Mrs. Martinez and asked her for her name so I could file an orderly complaint about her disgraceful behavior. She refused to tell me her name. Worse, she also tried to hide the tag with her name. After standing for a minute I was able to see her tag name and wrote it down on my phone. I indicated to her that I intended to file a complaint against her and that she had acted very rudely.

To my amazement, after a few minutes the flight attendant manager arrived and in a bullying tone without hearing my side threatened to take me out of the flight. My only sin was the fact that I wanted to find out the flight attendant's name in order to file a complaint. And if all that was not enough he hurled a complete lie at me in front of all the passengers that while I was reading Mrs Martinez's name from her tag I touched her tag name. Which constitutes libel and utter falsehood. This is even doubly serious when done in front of all the passengers and harms my good name. During the flight I spoke to the passengers who were next to me while I was asking Mrs Martinez for her name and everyone unequivocally confirmed that Mrs Martinez was lying and I did not touch her tag, I just looked at her tag to know her name. I manage in Israel in a large high-tech company a team that includes 50% women. Everyone will testify that I have a lot of respect for women and I will never behave in such a despicable way that involves touching the tag name of a service provider. Plus, as I mentioned I have been flying for 20 years and have never had an exceptional case with the air crews. I intend to conduct a polygraph examination in Israel regarding Mrs. Martinez's false claim and to sue her and the stewards manager for libel.

I also intend to contact the various media in my country and the relevant authorities in order to report this serious case which included damage to my good name and a chain of unprofessional events by Mrs Martinez and management. In addition I will file a complaint about the incident to the relevant airline authorities.",October 2021,"October 19, 2021",1.0,,,,,,,,

Warning: Never Fly Iberia,New York City,Barcelona,International,"Warning: Never fly Iberia
On October 1, 2021 My “WORST” airline travel experience began. We sat on a flight leaving JFK to Madrid for 5 hours only to only to be told the flight was cancelled. The employee’s could not tell us anything definitive other than good luck and I’m sorry. So I learned that those two phrases are their answers to everything. 
I called their customer service and I asked to be compensated for the hotel reservations I was going to miss and to be rescheduled and wouldn’t you know it what I got was I’m sorry and good luck.   After many attempts to contact their customer service representative (I us that term very loosely) I was told 1. They are not able to access the necessary systems on their computer to assist me; so why I am calling you and why are you called customer service?
We slept on the floor at JFK until I was able to reschedule out flight. 
Upon our return we flew from Barcelona to Madrid to only find out that the Madrid Iberia staff failed to inform us about an antigen test and we should have been tested prior to leaving Barcelona. While in Madrid I tried to ask for guidance from the Iberia employee’s and all I got was I’m sorry and good luck. 
Iberia employee’s make you feel like we must earn the privilege to request their assistance. It got so heated that the staff refused to assist me until I apologized to them.  I dug in my heels; it would be a cold day in hell before I would apologize.  
 We missed our flight that day also; but this time we were offered a hotel for the night with meals.
I have been flying for many years and never experienced some much confusion and lack of caring by the employees of Iberia. Their ability to communicate among themselves between departments to the best customer service experience is a – 100 horrible.

We ordered XL seats 2 weeks before the flight  (since we're tall) and Vegan food on online check in.
When we took the tickets from the counter, they didn't even tell us that they changed seats, as they co-shared with El-Al and apparently Iberia prefers to downgrade her own clients.
Only when we got to the plane, we discovered that we were seated in a crowded space (had 2-4-2 configuration, were seated in the 4). The flight attendants told us that nothing could be done at this point.
When meals were served, we were left hungry, as they didn't have any vegan food - apparently ordering food and seats in advance doesn't work with Iberia. As Seinfeld put it - anyone can take orders, but the point is to fulfill them.
The toilets were not cleaned the whole flight.
I wrote Iberia on Facebook when we landed, but didn't get any reply. I should have not been surprised,  as they never answered for me on twitter on a different issue for 3 weeks now.
Their costumer service is absolutely does not exist, as they refer you to their social media accounts - but rarely reply. 
Their Whatssup account is a bot, in Spanish.
They don't work on weekends so we couldn't call. We asked the hotel staff to do it - they only took care of the next flight. Complaint? online only.
 When we flew back, we went to their offices on the Madrid airport. After more than 30 minutes of waiting, their rep told us that there's no use complaining there, since it will take them 4 months to respond! He (obviously) to us to complain and ask the refund online, and it could take a month - I should chase them for something they did, they know about, and at least return my money.  I have doubts they ever refund.

Very Poor Customer Service,Madrid,Barcelona,Domestic,"My wife and myself brooked a round trip flight from Madrid, Spain to Barcelona, Spain through their website. Original booking went OK. We had a change of mind and wanted to rebook our fight for two weeks earlier. The web site told us that rescheduling flight would not be a problem with no extra charge. How ever rescheduling the flight cause us to be charged again for the flights. Therefore, we were being charged 2 time for same flights. 
     Contacting customer service in the US is a complete joke. Listing to the prerecorded massage and going through the list of option stakes a lot of time. After 3 minutes on hold,  you receive a message the all agent are busy please call back later and you are disconnected.  I spent 4 hours trying to get through. When I finally got through to a agent I was guaranteed I would receive a credit on my credit card.  This did not happen.  Repeated my call 3 other times with no luck and a lot of lost time.  Filed a complaint through the web site, but was told to call customer service, which I tried! I was going in circles!
    Our plans changed because of  Covid and I finally gave up trying to get some satisfaction.  I Stoped payment on my credit card, which I could do since it was in the time frame and did save 1/2 of my original investment in this trip.

"IF I COULD GIVE -100000000, I WOULD",Madrid,Los Cabos,International,"My luggage has been missing for 7 days. I have had to call iberia over 100 times over the last 7 days to try to locate it. They then tell me that I need to pay $400 for customs to release it (it was all personal items in there, nothing weird), so I pay, call them again, and no reply- no help- it’s been 4 more days since I’ve paid, and still they haven’t sent me my luggage. 
I have been on the phone to them for over 50 hours- with them telling me to call customs, call iberia, call aeromexico, call the airport, call customs again. NOT ONCE have they tried to help to get my luggage on a plane to be sent to me. 

I have spent half my honeymoon on the phones to get this suitcase. I am unable to go anywhere nor do I feel “pretty” seeing as I have none of my clothes, makeup, hair/skin products. I don’t have my medication, so I am also in constant physical pain. 
Iberia is the WORST. CUSTOMER. SERVICE. I have EVER experienced. 
I would rather fly in a one-winged broken engine properly or plane than ever fly with this moronic company again.

Dreadful Customer Support,London,Santiago,International,"My original flight was cancelled without any warning or notification. I only found out when I went to check in. It then took me 2 days to get through to anyone calling customer support! You get put on hold for 10 minutes and if there are no available agents, the call just hangs up and you have to redial. I did this MANY times until I eventually got through to someone who helped me rebook the flight at no additional cost.

The Iberia agent told me that any PCR test would do to leave the country, so when I turned up for my second flight with an NHS test, the lady refused to let me check in and said this wasn't a valid PCR test even though it clearly stated negative result.  This woman at the airport was absolutely useless and didn't provide any further information and so I missed my second flight.

I then had to rebook a third time and guess what....that also took 2 days to get through to an agent! Iberia, if you're reading this, hire more staff as agents as 2 days is completely unacceptable especially when you've taken a considerable amount of money. ABSOLUTLEY USELESS to say the least.

The flight itself wasn't too bad in all fairness. However, you should hire more friendly cabin crew, they all look miserable and most of them are rude.

Indifferent,Brussels,Madrid,Europe,"It’s an alright airline to get you from point A to B, for short-haul flight. However I would opt for an alternative if the option exists.

My expectations were already set low by the mere fact that agents at the call centre would literally hang up on me, which was frustrating to say the least. 

The experience on the plane itself was nothing to write home about. Most important to me, all the announcements were made in Spanish; I did not necessarily expect the language of the country they departed from (French and/or Dutch, given it’s Brussels) but they could at least try a few words in English. I did not heard a single word in English from the stewards, and there was 1 sentence in English from the pilot (a summary of what he said in Spanish). Service was equally austere; in fact, the interaction of the air-stewards with me was silent (which in a sense it’s a skill, but it can be perceived as rude), with an exception of a “good day” in Spanish. I don’t want to be harsh, but Iberia personnel’s behaviour makes even the customer service of Parisians feel tolerable. 

On another front, the procedures felt extremely relaxed, in the sense that a lady simply left her seat to visit the toilet while the safety video was on, and the personnel didn't even flinch; they did not bother either when passengers removed their masks during the flight (not for the purposes to eat, they had simply removed their masks).

Moreover, there was “water service” (still water or orange juice) and then the air-stewards were nowhere to be seen.

On a final critique, we purchased economy comfort, which included a seat with XL legroom; unfortunately, there was a last-minute change of plane (which changed our seat-selection even though we had checked-in, which I accidentally found out myself since there was no notification of any kind), and there were no XL seats on the seat arrangement of the new plane, which made the purpose of paying for a seat rather pointless.

Overall, maybe OK for a direct flight (definitely not for a long-distance one though), but I would prefer an alternative if possible.",September 2021,"September 26, 2021",2.0,,,,,,,,

The overstressed gate agent in Costa Rica wouldn't let us board and Iberia refused to honor the refund, blaming Covid and the country of Spain in the process (when it was their own errors/decisions, made by the low level, understaffed and overworked gate agents of Iberia). They abuse our trust for taking their marketing claims at face value and then abuse the definitions of fully, refund, fraud and force majeure as if they have never heard of Covid and didn't specifically up-sell me for this kind of risk.

There were no fewer than six flight changes before my trip. Customer service was essentially non-existent. Then...COVID. Iberia wouldn't offer a refund: just a voucher.

18 Months later, I tried to use that voucher. Chose flights. The website wouldn't let me complete the reservation. I tried many times, different browsers, etc. kept getting hung up. Tried customer service: hopeless: Iberia is the only co. I've ever dealt with where you are kept on hold for 15 minutes and _then_ a message comes on saying ""we're too busy, call again later,"" whereupon you are hung up on. Like many others, I tried and tried and tried again. Same thing. As happened last year, customer service was a farce.  So, technically I had a voucher I had to use and was ready to use. But I couldn't.

Finally, I said the heck with it. Booked a different flight (Lufthansa); tossing my $1055 pure fiction of a voucher. Who wants to fly with these jerks anyway?

2. Flights routinely get delayed, cancelled, and because you can't reach them by phone, you can't even rebook easily. My flight was cancelled 5 minutes before departure and they told us to drive 2 hours to another airport... lol WHAT?

3. Checked baggage literally gets lost 75% of the time for me. It was just lost on my way back from Spain and also once I recovered it five days later, someone had cut off my lock and stole over $250 of goods from my bag, leaving it in a total mess inside. The last few times I flew with them and my partner, they also lost her bags!

4. The business class offering is a joke. I got food poisoning from the steak. I took one bite and knew it had gone bad. No offerings of a wine menu, dinner menu, NADA!

5. The irony is afterwards I got a customer satisfaction survey and it was in German. How do you even mess up the last step? When have I ever indicated my preferred language is German? 

6. The website doesn't work most of the time, in fact it forces you to be a Male if you're a Female often times and doesn't let you change it. It's just so incredibly buggy.

My recommendation to flyers: Avoid Iberia at all costs. I fly more than 99% more than people and Iberia is literally leaps and bounds worse than even Aeroflot.

My recommendation to Iberia: Fire your entire leadership team, operations team, web development team, do a massive purging. You guys are a disaster in every possible way.",August 2021,"September 6, 2021",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Disappointing flight experience,Madrid,Los Angeles,International,"There were many small problems before, during, and after this flight that were annoying and unnecessary.  I had booked the ticket through American, it was a code share.  The Iberia website suggested that at check in I could select a seat for free, but I couldn't make it work.  I was assigned a window seat, normally I choose an aisle.  The day before the flight Iberia sent me a text asking me to be at the airport four hours before the flight.  This was not necessary.  You are directed to a kiosk which won't work since live people need to review your documents.  Iberia had friendly staff to help with this confusing process.  They wanted an attestation which was routine, they failed to indicate it was necessary before the flight.  They helped me fill it out online.  Then, when it came time to go to the gate they asked for proof of test and the attestation, even though my boarding card had been stamped that both were already verified at check in.  The flight was over 12 hours, yet there were only two beverage/meal services, characterized by inadequate food portions.

Incompetence at its peak,Malaga,Brasilia,International,"Iberia lost my luggage from my original destiny (Malaga) because the flight was more or less 40 minutes delayed. Besides having to run from one end of Madrid’s airport (one of the biggest in the world) to the other, and besides this flight being also delayed by 30 minutes, our belongings were not shipped.

After that, the crew made us fill in a form with info regarding the luggage (which has tags with our names) and said that we would be constantly updated regarding their arrival. Not only were we not updated at all, but also no one seems to know where the luggage is.

Iberia had two simple tasks to fulfill: (1) not delaying flights (it's a pandemic, we know there are fewer flights than usual), and (2) simply identify that no one took the luggage, so “lets check these tags! They might indicate the owners.”

It was a terrible experience to almost being stuck in Madrid because of a ridiculous delay. Then we lose our luggage full of essential items (my medicine for a health condition are all expensive, and they are all in that luggage).",August 2021,"September 1, 2021",1.0,,,,,,,,

Terrible,Madrid,Dublin,Europe,"We would just like to let people know of the terrible experience we have had with Iberia/Iberia Express Airlines.
We flew with Iberia in August (Mexico-Madrid-Dublin). We encountered a number of problems with Iberia; prior to boarding; regarding correspondence issued to us by Iberia prior to and during our trip, as well as a cancelled flight on the last leg of our journey. We were stranded for over 24 hours in Madrid because Iberia cancelled our flight and only offered us an alternative the next day. We had a number of out-of-pocket expenses as well as having to take extra time off work. But Iberia did not care. And that was very clear.
Firstly it was very difficult to get in touch in Iberia. Every time we tried to contact them by phone we were cut off. We were unable to access anyone via the web using the online forms, as they were restricting us from entering information. We tried to go to one of the Iberia counters at one of the airports and they were all closed. We sent numerous private messages through Messenger on Facebook that were unanswered. Only when we tagged Iberia on a public post on Facebook did they start to answer a message. Even then we were given the run around. Firstly we were fobbed off to BA, who subsequently wrote back and said it was Iberia's responsibility to deal with a particular issue. Iberia also advised we could contact Serviberia. When we accessed it, it said ' sorry this page has flown'. 
Eventually someone in Iberia gave us a correct link we could use to contact Serviberia. The response through Serviberia to our complaint was very disappointing to say the least. It seemed to be just some template letter with a few standard phases and an opt out clause that allowed Iberia not to help us. We were once again left feeling that Iberia did not care.
We can see from Iberia's Facebook page we were not the only customer struggling to get in touch with Iberia.
It's a pity Iberia can't take note of the customer feedback  and overhaul their customer service strategy which in our view, is clearly ineffective.
The reality is that an unhappy customer tells a lot more people about their experience. Poor customer service affects the bottom line!
We  just hope that no one else has to go through what we had to endure. We’re hopeful the airline  industry is recovering which will give customers a better choice of who they can travel with.",August 2021,"August 25, 2021",1.0,,3.0,,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,5.0
Horrible service,Chicago,Munich,International,"I flew Iberia from Chicago to Madrid and then to Munich on 8/1. No luggage when we showed up. We were going on a cruise, so in addition to my contact information, I gave them the contact information for the cruise line as well. They would pick up the luggage and relay it to the next port on the river. They never called or emailed the cruise line. Since I was on the river most of the time, it was very hard to contact me. They sent me 2 emails in English acknowledging the lost luggage. The next 3 emails were in  Spanish and they went straight to spam since I don't speak Spanish. It is now 8/23 and I still don't have my luggage. I was told on the 15th that they had it in Munich and they were sending it to me. Not a word since. I have called and been on hold for hours.

Avoid at all costs,Kefalonia,New York City,International,"Absolutely the worst airline I have flown on in my many years traveling.    

We were not able to check in online for the second leg of our flight, nor was the ticket agent for Iberia able to check us in at the Kefalonia airport.  We were thus forced to take the tram to another part of the Madrid airport to grab our luggage, find out where we can check in, take the tram back to another part of the airport, go through passport control, then security, gate control, and RUN to the gate.  We had a 2 hour window to do all this, in a packed airport, where no one spoke English.  Our 2 hour window was shorted to 1.5 hours because we sat at the gate in Madrid for a half hour because they did not have a staircase to allow us to disembark and get on the bus.  Best part - no air conditioning when we finally got on the plane.

Additionally, the Iberia customer service on the plane is non-existent.  We were given a small paper cup for water, which they filled with about 2 ounces of water.  Forget the exasperation from the stewardess when you asked for more water.  They ran out of the pasta, and the only other option was rice and a rubbery beef patty on top, stale bread, and a small piece of cake.  They did not have a salad, nor fruit.  Normally, I wouldn't care because we always purchase water bottles and food before we board a plane.  But, given the check-in problems, we were literally running to make the plane and did not have any time to purchase food.  

Additionally, the flight staff overall was extremely rude.  Due to the inability to check in, the four of us were seated in four different parts of the plane and had the pleasure of dealing with various staff.  We all had the same complaints.

The seats are tiny, and leg room is nonexistent.  I'm 5'4"" and my knees touched the seat in front of me.  Between the airline fee and additional fees for luggage, etc...., we spent over $1,800 for each ticket, purchased 6 months in advance, and did not receive anywhere near the level of service for which we paid.",August 2021,"August 16, 2021",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

The worst airlines company,Paris,Marrakech,International,"After losing my luggage, I have been told the suitcase was left over in Orly airport . Iberia airline promised to send it back to me as soon as possible.

Now it has been almost one week and there is no any updates. I am calling them every day without any solution.The lost suitcase is full of gifts for my family. It was already annoying that I couldn’t give them to their hands. Now it seems Iberia airline doesn’t even want to give it back to my hands. 

We paid the price for the air tickets not for luggage loss.

A SCAM AIRLINE!  DO NOT FLY WITH IBERIA.,San Francisco,Barcelona,International,"I booked a round trip for two April 1st on Iberia, and they sent an unrecognizable email in June from a “Fly Level” addressee… not “Iberia,” as all previous communication came from.   It went to my Junk email, and I have just learned they cancelled both outgoing AND incoming non-stop flights for a scheduled trip in October.  They offer a potential flight change and/or refund.   However, no flights are available that are non-stop, which is why I booked with them in the first place.  Then their “manage booking” site says no flights available at all and to call a number that always hangs up on you, continuously saying to call back later.  If you try to submit a refund request online it says to call, but they won’t take the call…. A common complaint I have since read in these reviews.    I have spent hours trying to reach an agent.   Plus, the amount of the ticket refund they quote is over two hundred dollars off…. In their favor!  WRONG.  They currently owe me $1,637.00 dollars.

When she tried to pass him the phone so that I could translate for him, he refused again. My mother was crying hysterically and almost missed her flight. I am so disappointed to know that as a global airline Iberia refused to help a vulnerable passenger over the age of 60 because she did not speak Spanish.

Firstly the attitude of the Cabin Crew. I would describe them as unfriendly, and cold. They seem to have an arrogance about them which gives the impression that the passenger is a nuisance. One has to ask for everything. They do not walk around and engage with the traveller, nor ask if they can get you anything. They seem to want to get the meal service over and done with as soon as possible after take off and then are hardly visible for 9 or 10 hours. I had to ASK for everything.

Because of this I had to book  a new flight with an airline that doesn't do transit in Spain, to finally be able to return.

Still they don't offer any refund! Only thing they offer is a voucher.

I already had to pay for a new flight and don't really want a voucher if they can't take me to my destination anyways! But what makes it even worse is this:

They said it'd be no problem, just don't check-in online rather ask the check-in desk. Except the check-in lady would have none of it because the bookings were made separately. 
I always find it hilarious when airline staff keep asking customers to make their life easier but when it comes to make our life easier somehow they always present the same middle finger.

"Horrible, terrible airline! SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE!",Santorini,Madrid,Europe,"My bf and i were traveling from Santorini, Greece to Madrid, Spain for a layover. To start off, this airport is HUGE. It’s very difficult to direct yourself and the staff at this airport are not very helpful and rude. The people here just look at you and talk to you like   you’re the S word. Iberia airline did not inform us that we would need a negative covid test before boarding our flight, so my bf and i were not allowed  on the plane (yes we’re vaccinated) and this came as a total shock to us. Keep in mind we had been running around the airport for an hour trying to  make it on time just to get rejected at the gate. To add to that, our suitcases were already on the plane so although we were stuck in Madrid, our stuff  left for NY. Afterwards, we were at the airport for five hours trying to figure everything out. We were fortunate enough to get tested on time at the  airport although the staff was also quite rude. It took about 2 hours to finally be seen by someone. While in line we learned that about a dozen other  people were in the same situation as us. I think that alone just says a lot about the quality of Iberia.  After getting tested with a negative result we were
 told to head to the ticket booth line to receive new boarding passes for the following day. The lady who helped us at the ticket booth desk had a horrible attitude (surprise, surprise.) Before i even got to explain to her our situation she made a snappy remark at me. After 15 mins she was able to get us new boarding passes and a voucher for a hotel nearby, which was the least they could do for their s****y customer service. The following day we got to the airport an hour before the departure time. We 
attempted checking in using the kiosk but it wouldn’t work so we decided to get in line to check in with a representative instead. While in line my bf asked one of the staff a question and she proceeded to tell us that we could not board our flight ... we were confused and irritated at this point. According to the lady we were too late (We were an HOUR early) like how is that possible ? She made us step out of the line and told us that we would need to get new boarding passes for the next day .. like is this a joke? I was so pissed i was ready to hit someone preferably one of the staff. About 40-50 mins later we were helped by someone. We explained to her what had happened and when we asked her why we weren’t allowed to board our flight she responded with “idk you should’ve been able to” ... so as you can see the customer service here is awful, the staff are rude and clueless, there is a lot of miscommunication from the airline, and no one wants to spend more than a minute to help. So as a result my bf and i had to stay in Madrid for not one but two nights, wearing the same clothes, and extremely exhausted after all the bs we had to deal with from Iberia.

The app wouldn't let me check in the day before my flight departed. I went to the airport and they told me I had been deleted from the flight list, I still don't know what this means. After standing there for 3 hours and being completed ignored and disregarded by their staff, I went home (£70 in Ubers that day) The manager didn't want to know and the lady who supposed to be helping me kept asking me to stand to one side whilst she helped other people to check in even though there were other desks free. She kept rolling her eyes and spoke to me very rudely and made damn sure I knew I was a massive inconvenience for her. 

The following day (after my amazing flight company Dial A Flight ensured I was checked in) I got to the airport and checked in. I asked them if I could upgrade due to the inconvenience from the day before, it was a 'computer says no' situation. What a surprise! The airplane was dirty, the staff rude, the food vile.

On the return flight they charged me 3 times for my seat selection, I keep calling and I'm in a queue then they tell me to call again and cut me off. I suppose I won't ever be receiving that refund! The actual flight - same thing, dirty aircraft, food inedible, but this flight I must say the staff were excellent. Completely differemt attitude then on the outbound flight.

"Too bad I can't score them ""0""",Madrid,Tel Aviv,International,"I booked a Tel Aviv-Madrid flight and returned at the end of March. For reasons related to Covid (israeli citizens were not accepted at that time in Spain), I had to cancel my departure.
Instead of receiving the money back, I was forced to receive a voucher. But unlike other airlines, Iberia has decided that Israel will only receive the right to use the voucher for 6 months, provided you make the reservation within 3 months.
So until 30/6 I have to order a flight, otherwise the voucher expires. I ordered a flight and I already visited Spain, the rest of $ 170 remained but I have nothing to do with them.
I hope they are used by Iberia when they go bankrupt - which is what they want soon - to pay wages to the incompetent people working there!
and now about their service: there is none, everything I found out is from the internet. The phones given in Spain were useless, a pity for the money thrown away.
The flight left and arrived on time, the service during the flight was null, at the beginning what they call "" food "" was distributed.
Nothing was edible. 1/2 glass of water and coffee was immediately distributed, then no one received anything. The flight lasts 5.5 hours ...interesting why the whole team gets paid, they didn't do anything!
On return flight, Iberia checks in for all existing flights at that time only at 3 counters. One of them was always busy with families with children, so there were 2 left.
Many people did not respect the turn, screaming and even beating, but apart from one person who took care to sit with a mask on his face, no one was interested in anything.
In the security control area, it was full of machine gun soldiers. But what if something serious happens in the check-in area? Nobody was interested in anything, everything is just for the facade. Not to mention that it should have a separate area for departures to Israel ...
I arrived at the airport in Madrid 3 hours before the flight and I ended up running to the gates to catch the last bus. Because the plane was not coupled to the sleeve, that was their security measure! It was a 1/2 hour walk from one end of the airport to the other!

This corresponds to an extra 7 hours of travel time. We are a family of 5 with three kids under 7, including a 4 year old who is severely disabled. I contacted Iberia several times, have been on hold for a grand total of 6 hours and on the phone for a total of 5 hours speaking to the most incompetent customer service team I have ever had the misfortune to interact with. I could go on and on about just how bad, but I will just leave this review with the punch line: Iberia did not care that they are subjecting my severely disabled 4 year old daughter to an extra 7 hours of travel time. I was told, very bluntly, my options: (1) accept the route or (2) accept a refund. I asked to speak to a supervisor so I could explain my daughter's situation and was told ""if we transferred everyone to a supervisor we would never be able to get any work done""....apparently a severely disabled child is not enough to get an Iberia supervisor down from their Ivor Tower.

We were robbed blindly,Orlando,Jerez De La Frontera,International,"My husband, my 2 year old, my 4 month old and I went purchased tickets to go to Spain in May. We spent close to $4,000.00. We called the airline one wk prior to flying & were told we only needed the CoVID negative test & our passports & we were good to go. We arrived at the airport 3 and 1/2 hrs early for the flight. Upon arrival we were told we needed a “QR” code & without it we couldn’t get in line to check in or on the flight. I begged everyone who worked there  for help for hours. No one would. I finally snuck into the line after an hour and a half. I had asked to speak to a manager 12 times & was completely ignored. When I got to the counter I gave the agent our CoVID negative tests and passports. I was directed to a website to get the QR code. I tried to get it done, after almost 2 hours I asked if we were going to miss the flight. She said you have a few minutes to get to boarding. She then tried to manually check us in. Then she looked at our passports that had been in front of her for almost 2 hours & said “do you have passports from any other country?” We said “no.” She said “sorry, you’re American, so you can’t board this flight.”
Iberia sold me tickets they knew I couldn’t use & after fighting for almost a week with them, they have refused to refund me or even give us a credit for a future flight. They literally robbed our money. This is total fraud. They gave us no resolution. Just said “sorry, we are not giving you a refund or giving you any credit towards a future flight.

The WORST staff,Madrid,Venice,Europe,"The worst flight attendant staff. This was my 1st European flight and it was me +2 little kids (ages 4 & 1) after traveling from the states (moving to Italy) with an 8 hour layover in Madrid. 

By the time we boarded the Iberia flight to Venice (flight 3244), I was on 0 hours of sleep over the past 30 hours. My children, also on very limited sleep, particularly my 4 year old son. Upon boarding the flight, the flight staff just stared at me while I struggled with my kids and items. When I asked for help, once of the flight attendants basically berated me for having so much stuff (carryons and car seat) and said I should’ve checked it all with bulk luggage. Now, I admit I had a lot of items - I needed to survive the long flight and layover with 2 littles all on my own. However, if there was an option to check my stuff at the gate prior to boarding Iberia I would have HAPPILY done so. But nothing was offered or even said to me when my ticket was scanned to board. 

Then again, upon exiting the plane, I waited for everyone else to get off before me so not to hold anyone else up... the flight staff just stared at me. One flight attendant did take one of my suitcases and placed it right outside the airplane door. Meanwhile, my son is throwing a major meltdown (because what 4 year old can tolerate 2 hours of sleep over the last 30 hours) and while exiting one of the staff members had the nerve to rudely “shush” him, only making him cry even more. 

I know this review won’t be read by the airline corporate, and if it is they probably don’t care, but it’s a real shame that the flight staff is my first impression of Spaniards.

Bad !!

I’ve had to call them several times and always get the runaround I’ve been waiting for over a month now for a refund and I have been waiting several days for them to re-issue a voucher after they canceled a the trip that should not have been canceled. 
I believe they moved their call Center to Columbia and all they do there and just take a message and pass it on to somebody else God knows where all I keep being told is that something needs to be verified and they need a couple more days than in a few more days they need a few more days and in a few more days they need a week then a week later they need a few more days etc. etc. etc.. 
I’m traveling with two other parties for total of 13 passengers and I don’t even have my tickets yet because I’m waiting on this voucher to be updated. 
To say dealing with them it’s frustrating is a huge understatement in my honest opinion not worth the risk to choose Iberia as your airline.

An exasperating experience,Madrid,Santiago de Compostela,Domestic,"Have just completed phone calls with actual.  Iberia reservations/customer service personnel, both on their 800 US number and the (Madrid?) Spain number, after two days of off and on attempts with a miserably dysfunctional website and being on hold on their phone lines, with dropped calls after long waits.

But I still Received conflicting information regarding my inability to travel from Madrid to Santiago de Compostela. I'm a US citizen living in Los Angeles CA, getting my second COVID vaccine next week and, of course, unable to travel tomorrow between those two cities within Spain. This is a ticket for travel postponed from last year due to the even more restrictive pandemic situation at that time.

I finally told one res. employee that I was giving up. Cancel the reservation for tomorrow on this one-way ticket. Let someone else buy a ticket tomorrow morning and occupy that seat.  I'll take the loss (about 70 euros) since I can't get credit towards a future ticket.  Live employees are not allowing me to do so even though this was permitted last year;  and the website won't even let me access my reservation, despite the fact that I'm providing the accurate requested info.

I travel between MAD-SCQ, round trip, two to three times a year. How I wish Iberia would restore itself to it's former somewhat good reputation. I'm seriously going to consider trying out some possible competitor on that route later this year for two hoped-for trips from the US.

Routinely refuse to give EU mandated compensation.,Paris,Almeria,Europe,"I used to fly with Iberia regularly (now I prefer to fly with low budget as they don't break the law.)

Iberia flouts the law by never giving customers mandatory compensation as per EU regulations. This has been highlighted to the European Council with no result.

They also routinely do not store check-in luggage in the hold due to lack of space. Like most airlines, they charge for check-in luggage, meaning that most passengers bring the maximum size carry on, which does not fit in the overheads on smaller planes, therefore carry-on is put in the hold with priority and check-in is left on the tarmac. This would be somewhat if they followed the law afterwards and compensated passengers according to the law for their business decision, but they don't.

I have also been in situations where iberia was unable to bring me to my final destination, again with no compensation.

It seems to me like they are protected by the Spanish courts as any escalation of this illegal behaviour is unsuccessful. Using an airlines claims service such as Airhelp will likely also not get you a result as they will fight any claim tooth and nail.

Basically, if you want to arrive at your destination with your luggage or be correctly compensated when you don't, don't fly Iberia. their low cost partner Vueling seem to be more compliant than the full-cost national airline.",July 2020,"April 22, 2021",1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,3.0

WORST AIRLINE EVER! F*** Iberia!,Mexico City,Madrid,International,"WORST AIRLINE EVER! I arrived to Mexico City from Dallas Texas and they had us go through security and once we were at the gate waiting past the time of departure they told us the flight was cancelled due to ""Maintenance of the plane."" They told us they would put us in a hotel and we would leave on the same flight tomorrow. They made us have to go through security a second time to go grab our bags from the baggage claim. We then went to the airport hotel. Next day we cue up about 3 or 4 hours before our flight to check in. We wait about 1 and a half hour to 2 hours to be told that the flight is full. Nearly everybody from the flight was then told tomorrow they would be on the flight. One woman was crying hysterically because her parents were in the hospital from an accident and she needed to fly today. They told us ""YOU AREN'T PRIORITY even though we cancelled your flight from yesterday and we aren't responsibible for any incovenciences we cause you that don't pertain to the flight route you have booked with us. Personal affairs or other travel plans."" I had a doctors appointment due to cancer follow up I needed to get to. I rebooked airlines tickets and PCR tests for when I was in Europe twice due to them cancelling on us twice..........They give me a ticket for the next day and the hotel voucher but tell me they can't give me a ticket for Madrid to Barcelona my final destination and can't guarantee what flight I will get on or if I get on and only that tomorrow when I come to check in for the third time can I get my Barcelona ticket.....We arrive third day and cue up about 5 hours before our flight. I get in with no problem and the woman wants to book me with an hour time to change flights haha. I ask for 5 hours. We get to the gate and at the gate they tell us only surgical masks. They make loads of people go next door to the pharmacy to buy surgical masks. Then to top it off I make it to Barcelona and THEY HAVE LOST MY BAG. I was one of the first that day to check in getting there so early and my bag was left in Madrid. I had a flight the next day on Monday so couldn't have the bag sent to my place and they said they don't hold bags for 2 weeks so I had to go home (with jet lag and not sleeping) then 5 hours later when the bag arrived on another flight get my bag.....I saw very little attentiveness and initiative from the Iberia check in counter employees in Mexico City to think outside the box and try to reroute customers to other destinations and get them to their destination quicker.

Do not book through this airline! Simple as that,Lima,London,International,"I am absolutely disgusted with with the “service” Iberia offers, I put service in quotations because they do not provide any. 
I had a flight cancelled from klm so they moved my flight to them, they did not move my 2 baggage’s so I had to pay for only 1 which cost £180 when I had 2 bags with klm for £100. 

My was taking the flight and could not pay cash for bags at check in as I am paying, they do not let me pay over the phone and the website does not work, I tried to make a payment over and over and it did not confirm but they still took 5 x £180 out of my account and 5x £45 for the cost of the meals but nothing is confirmed, they give you 24 hours after check in to book everything but they do not connect the phone call, I rang this company 100 times over and over and got through twice, the first time they said nothing they can do so go online, I stressed that the website does not work, they just read of a script and did not help, they said there was an email online for complaints and hung up on me, there is no email or any other way to contact them other than the phone number that does not connect, I have wasted an entire day and am still no closer to sorting out this very important issue, I stressed how important it is and they simply just say do it at check in even though I told them this is not possible!! They are rude, disgusting, unhealthful, pathetic, impatient and incompetent at their job, they did not put me through to a supervisor when I requested. My fiancé’s flight is in 10 hours and I am no closer to confirming baggage and meals, but yet I have £800 taken from my account. This airline should be closed down, they are a joke, they provide the worst customer service I have ever came across, just blindly reading a script that does not apply to our situation.

Unfortunately, I cannot say anything good about the Customer Service either. After 2 minutes on the phone they would rush me to end the call without actually helping me. Their reason was ( and I am not joking here): My performance is measured by how much time I spend in each call so we have to conclude!

Thieves. They would let a kid starve for a penny.,London,Madrid,Europe,"I HOPE EVERYONE READS THAT. THAT IS THE SUMMARY OF A COMPLAINT THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR MONTHS. IBERIA ARE THIEVES. 

I AM STILL FIGHTING FOR MY RIGHTS TO HAVE MY MONEY BACK. IBERIA IGNORES ME BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT A BIG CORPORATION CAN DO: LYING AND WAIT UNTIL I GIVE UP.
AND THAT IS NOT HAPPENING. I GOT EVERYTHING DOCUMENTED. 

On November the 20th 2020 I requested a voucher for my flights to Spain, for me and my 4 years old.
The flight was on Christmas time and I received changes on flight times.
At the beggining my sister was coming with us under the same booking, but we splited the booking off on November the 14th, as she was unsure if she wanted the voucher.
At the end she decided to request the voucher and she received it.
Mine, however was denied. I called Iberia to request it again as I was entitled to it, the same way my sister was. They told me I was right and they processed it again. A month later, I contacted them again as I never received the voucher or any kind of notification from Iberia. A lady told me, the voucher under my name was approved, but my son's was failing. She said it was caught on a sort of loop of requested-processed-denied and the matter had already escalated to another department. She told me I could not get the voucher for my flight as both were under the same booking and I had to wait for my son's one to be approved. I was worried the dates of the flight were going to arrive and I did not get the voucher. The lady reassured me the voucher process had already started and it did not matter if the flight date arrived.
On Jannuary I tried to call them again quoting the incident number 20210202-12217012. The man I spoke to said he was looking at the voucher on his screen but the number was missing. He told me he was going to pass the issue to the voucher department and I will get it within 2 weeks. Since then, I have been calling every fortnight and they say they will contact me back within 2 weeks.
I still have no vouchers and no money. When I ask for the refund the say they will contact me in 2 weeks. When I ask for someone to contact me about it they say '2 weeks'. And every 2 weeks I have to call Iberia back to get the same answer.
And by the way, 2 days before the first flight, I received an email from Iberia saying that my 4 YEAR OLD SON had an upcoming flight. My name disappeared from the booking. A 4 years old travelling alone becayse Iberia removed me from the booking, kept my money, did not give me a refund or a voucher.
I AM STILL DOWN BY £400 BECAUSE OF THESE THIEVES.

Dishonest company - Crooks,Bordeaux,Lima,International,"Due to COVID, I have several voucher from 3 different airlines as I had booked travel for the whole family who resides in different parts of the world.
IBERIA is the only airline that systematically refuse to extend the voucher they gave me.
Other airlines are Aeromexico and Latam. Both accepted to extend booking until Dec 2021 for flights in 2022. IBERIA still refuses.
Why do I say they are dishonest:

1- When COVID restrictions started, they lured their clients into vouchers with a 10 or 15% additional amount. Doing so, they did voluntarily omit to tell their clients that they could be reimbursed as per European regulation. They just did not propose it and counted on the rebate offered to distract they clients.

2- There is no way to send an email to customer service, let alone escalating an email to a manager. The only way to get to customer service is to call. However, doing so, the agents on the line tell you that their role is not to manage vouchers. For this, they send you to the website of IBERIA, which has a form for complaints that does not accept vouchers number, but only the original booking number... which is not accepted in my case since the voucher number replaced the original booking number. So basically, you cannot use either their complaint form.

Don't get me wrong, the client service employees are generally polite but they clearly received instructions to not resolve any voucher issue or extend those, let alone to proceed with any refunds.
Clients of IBERIA are totally left alone. My only hope now is to turn myself to a European court as I have 4,000 euros of vouchers that are about to expire.

Covid is the new excuse for poor service,San Jose,Madrid,International,"I just flew the 10 hour flight from SJO-MAD on the A330. My first time on Iberia. 

I was handed a moist toilette and trash bag (yes this is business class) just prior to takeoff. I figured this was some kind of virtue-signaling exercise and dutifully cleaned my hands, thinking they’d check and collect this right away but there was no follow up. I finally figured out this would be the main way to dispose of trash on this flight! (yes in business class). 

Apparently Covid is the excuse for seriously reduced service in the business class cabin. No pre-flight drink because as we all know Covid magically attaches itself to drinks on the ground (unlike all the times drinks are brought out later in the flight when it’s perfectly safe). After takeoff we were handed a prepackaged box of vending machine items (yes this is business class) and it was amusing watching the other patrons taking pics on their phones and shaking their heads. I showed a pic to a friend later and he described it as “prison food.”

Seating in this cabin was comfortable so they got that right.

Later in the flight I caught a flight attendant lounging in the galley with his mask unattached while the residue from everyone’s drink and food items was piling up in the business class cabin. Covid is the excuse for all kinds of misbehavior and lack of service. I hope all airlines aren’t like this.

Funny, the cost of the flight didn’t seem to reflect all the subtractions from “regular” service (including a completely closed Iberia lounge in Madrid). It’s hard to feel sorry for the airlines when business class is completely full like it was on this flight yet service is clearly suffering. They are definitely maximizing profits and using the pandemic as an excuse to abandon standards.

Disgusting customer service skills. Horrific organisation. Never again.,Havana,London,International,"Havana - Madrid - flight was a little bit late.
Madrid - Heathrow - despite being at the gate 15 mins before, the connecting flight had taken off without a load of passengers booked on the plane.
After incredibly bad organisation at customer service desks and rude staff,  I was booked on the flight the next morning, which was the day the UK introduced PCR tests which I did not have*. I was not allowed to leave the terminal to get a test because of customs. Iberia said they would let me on the plane the next day despite no test (and the British embassy also confirmed this was ok given the situation) - it was all organised as an exception. After sleeping in the freezing cold terminal, the next day they refused me on the plane. They had to re-book me on the flight later that day, where I feared the same thing would happen again. Iberia were useless, and not concerned about giving me any solutions throughout the situation. They had hours to work with customs and the embassy to get this resolved, and they were just horrific. Promises from one side of the airport (by Iberia supervisors), failed to reach other help desks they told me to go and see, who they said would be aware of the situation (they weren't and they were useless and accusational). My luggage had already flown to London without me I found out later - they took hours to tell me where my bags were. Their duty of care to customers was appalling. I understand these are testing times and issues will occur, but how they dealt with it just made the whole thing much more distressing. I felt like I was Tom Hanks stuck in the terminal forever. 
Overall I arrived in Heathrow 25 hours after I was meant to. The final plane I took off on was 1 hour late because we actually waited for people on a connecting flight!

After arriving at the airport and paid for a PCR test they say that we are not allowed to do the layover in Madrid.

Iberia: reasons to avoid at all costs,Barcelona,Boston,International,"I will try to be factual so it could be helpful for others when deciding whether they want to book a ticket with Iberia. Personally, I would warn against it as strongly as possible, as no budget airline has treated me this way during a global epidemic such as Iberia – and funny thing is, my issues started way before the mass cancellations and before COVID was on the radar in Europe. We had a return flight (two separate bookings for me and my partner) to the US. In short:

1) BOOKING: I selected a package with cancellation insurance as I considered it to be a crucial factor for going with Iberia. The order went through, but in the end, I just received a message regarding the failure of contracting the insurance. I was NOT given an option to reconsider my purchase, they deducted the rest of the booking just fine i.e. flights, extra cost for seats etc. The fact that the confirmation email couldn't be sent was the least of the problems (I have proof).

2) POST-BOOKING 1: My booking never actually showed up in my account even after numerous tries of adding it. I could only review it if I searched for it separately.

3) POST BOOKING 3: There were times when my bookings got mixed up and random booking codes were shown on the site (I have proof).

4) POST-BOOKING 2: Iberia detached two suitcases from my booking, which I had to chase to get a separate booking number for them.

5) VOUCHER TROUBLES: During the start of the pandemic, when all airlines were suffering, I decided to accept a voucher partially to help out Iberia, and since Iberia did NOT offer a refund at the time of cancellation, which I am pretty sure goes against all EU regulations. Then, obviously my replacement flight which I bought from the voucher got cancelled too, at which point I asked for a monetary refund as I could not plan like that: surprisingly their official (and only) communication changed to this: "" It's not possible to give a cash refund for bookings paid with vouchers"". I only purchased with a voucher as my original flight – which was paid by card – was already canceled and I trusted the airline a second time by accepting a voucher. So no monetary refund.

6) FALSE INFORMATION ON REFUND REQUEST AND CUSTOMER DISCRIMINATION: I have had tens of phone calls with them always stating I will not accept a voucher under any circumstances for the second cancellation, and I request a monetary refund. These were regarding two separate bookings (2 x 208.95 EUR), which apparently is more than what they value a customer for since I and my partner will never choose this company again and trying to spread the word to everyone we meet. So just to state it, I was asking for less than 500 EUR refund after the issues and incorrect (highly likely illegal) handling of my bookings, 2 cancellations, and numerous phone calls that cost me money. I said I would drop my case if I get what I am owed. On most of these, I got their usual reply stating that booking made with a voucher cannot be refunded to a bank account – again, never was I offered the option for a refund in the first place –, however on two separate occasions when I called in Spanish I was ensured that the refund will be made to my bank account (I always stated not to proceed otherwise). Needless to say, this was discrimination at its best too, as the English-speaking customer service clearly had other instructions on treating customers, while the Spanish one was more helpful. In the end, this did not happen, and I got refunded with a voucher, on top of this Iberia claimed such information was never provided and falsely accused me of incorrectly stating what actually happened.

7) REFUND TO VOUCHER WHEN EXPLICITLY REFUSED: As I have described, I stated I do not accept a voucher and want a monetary refund. I was assured on two separate phone calls it would happen for the two separate bookings (only when calling in Spanish...), but I finally relieved that almost a year of requests and chasing Iberia paid off, and I will get my 420€ back. Iberia thought otherwise and while I was refusing to accept a voucher, they simply made the refund to one anyway while I was on the phone with them!

To warn people how desperate they might get if they decide to fly with Iberia, I am outlining my next steps to get support on proving how Iberia mistreated me and very likely many other customers:
1. Review & flight cancellation rights ( done)
2. Turn to AEPD – the Spanish Data Protection Agency
3. File a claim through a 3rd party
4. Contact consumer protection authorities

So overall, please think twice / three times or more before ever deciding to purchase a ticket with Iberia. They treat their customers horribly in a time when they need to support the most, and that says everything about a company.

Today I called the customer service three times to change my flight 15 days before my flight according to their policy. Well, they first charge me about $200 for service.

This is because they costs changes on flights with their internal system and not with the prices announced online. Although it said in their webpage that any change would be easy to do online, that wasn't the case. It took me over two hours on the phone for making the flight change.

WORST AIRLINE EVER,Madrid,London,Europe,"I was recently meant to travel from Madrid to London Heathrow with Iberia airlines. I had never flown with them before and after reading the reviews I was a little nervous, however I went ahead and booked a flight home anyway. Shortly after booking the flight I received news that my local area at home was seeing a surge in cases, and that both my parents (both NHS front line workers) were working 13+ hour days and it was unsafe for me to go home. The only option Iberia offered me when cancelling my flight was a voucher, with the conditions that I book again on a direct, Iberia operated only flight. Despite trying to find the option for a full refund, I was unable to do so, and instead had to book a flight to Bulgaria, where I am a medical student. 
I tried to use the voucher code Iberia had given me, however low and behold, the voucher couldn't be used on this flight. I will never be contemplating flying with Iberia again, and neither will my family, let alone physically getting on their airplanes or using the voucher code. I had to rebook a flight with Bulgaria Air, which cost me £200. All in all I have lost out on £300 due to Iberia's poor booking policies and refund policies. 
As much as I understand we are in the middle of a pandemic, I think this form of refund offer is quite frankly horrific. I earlier rang the customer service line and was told to simply sell my Iberia voucher on to someone else. 
If I could give this a -5* rating I would, I haven't been offered any form of compensation that is actually useful to me, and my money is clearly still in Iberia's pocket and looks likely to remain that way unless I kick up enough of a fuss. My flight was due to be on August 2nd, and the only reason I am chasing this up 10 days after the event is due to my full schedule with university exams. I will never be using Iberia again and quite frankly am disgusted that they offer such specific vouchers, keeping cash flow through their company.",August 2020,"August 13, 2020",1.0,,,,1.0,,,,

"Avoid this airline at all ""COSTS""",San Jose,London,International,"Absolutely the worst service from ANY airline. It's no surprise they've rated so badly all over. The only reason this airline was used is because it was the only choice due to limited selections this year. 

My wife booked a flight with them to go through Spain onto London and from minute one they were issues!

First the website section wasn't working to enter the day for DOB and only accepted 01. So after booking had to call them to get that changed. 

After booking and talking to an agent they indicated the original route couldn't work and would need to be changed. The original fare was 697 EUR and the new fare was to be 528 EUR. Despite the new fare being LESS than the old, they charged 58 EUR fare difference plus change fee, plus booking fee for a total of over 240 EUR !! 

The agent on the phone took 58 min on the phone trying to run my credit card 4 times and never got it done despite giving all the correct information. 
I called back an hour later and spoke to another agent who saw the info in the sytem and when she read it back to me, the last agent had my country as New Zealand!! I'm in the Caribbean! This agent fixed the other agent's incompetence and the payment was done. 

Finally... the Optima package was paid for which includes 1 checked bag and free seat reservation 24hrs before. Again with issues to their website when trying to reserve the seat the page had an error. So again a call was made to them and was told they can only make a seat reservation for a fee. With less than 24hrs and needing a seat to complete the Spain health form, another fee of 40 EUR was charged by the criminal company! 

If you have ANY choice in air travel DO NOT fly with Iberia. It's a reason they are rated so poorly all over!

I've postponed buying the ticket as I was trying to spend as little on the new ticket as I could. On the 29th of June I called at around noonish and spoke with your customer service, they offered me a refund so I can just book a new flight as it's costed me £5000 to stay an extra month in the UK. I asked if I can take a few days to decide if I want the refund as he told me it would take 4-5 weeks for it to process. After waiting while he spoke with his manager I was told it's ok to take a few days as he was weighting a note like they've done multiple times in the past. Today, I called from 07309648124 at 01:11 to have the refund approved and the voucher canceled. The agent I spoke with from the minute he picked up was rude, as I was explaining to him what I was told and the position i was placed in I heard him talking to his colleague talking saying something alone the lines of asking if I was lying then he said ""I think so."" I didn't take offence to it as I wasn't meant to hear him. As he was collecting my information he then said to me ""were going to investigate and see who approved your refund or if I ever spoke to someone"". After taking a step back and calming down I called again. The employee I spoke with next started off better but after she spoke with her manager her attitude had changed and again I was met with a wall of disrespect. Don't fly with this company if you value your time and money. This has been an absolute nightmare of an experience. REGARDLESS OF HOW CHEAP AVOID THIS COMPANY!",May 2020,"July 1, 2020",1.0,,,,,,,,
Unprofessional employers,London,Madrid,Europe,"We had the a flight on Friday 26th of June from Heathrow to Madrid.Time 19:20 and number of flight IB3173.The previous night we called the Iberia customer service to ask if there were any updates about the flight.The employer Jorge told me that I couldn’t fly toMadrid because I’m not Spanish neither English.He gave me all the  wrong information and with a very bad attitude.The rest of the employees   didn’t know neither  if I was able to fly to Madrid.My nationality is Bulgarian and as most  people know YES  it does belong to Europe.Something that the employees  of Iberia seem not to know .The next day another employee gave my passport to the EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT at Heathrow airport as he didn’t know that my country belongs to Europe as well.The EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT kept me waiting 10 minutes just to check if my country is in Europe.His name is Guillermo .He didn’t even see the front of my passport which states the European Community .He had a really bad attitude as well.    
 
 My question is how is   it possible a big company like Iberia to have those  kind of employees ?Isn’t it terrible the fact that there are people without jobs and incapable people with jobs.Its unacceptable that executive  assistant working in one of the biggest European airports doesn’t even know the countries  that belong to the European Community.It’s an embarrassment for the company.

 Make sure that as a company you train your employees  properly  .It is totally unacceptable that your staff have so basic knowledge  it’s a shame and ridiculous.",June 2020,"June 29, 2020",1.0,,,,,,,,

Their Customer Service Is unbelievable Horrible,San Francisco,Barcelona,International,"I booked a ticket for April 2020 to Barcelona, unfortunately due to Covid-19, all flight been cancelled.  First I've never got notification from the airline until my friend told me to check.  Then I found there was no way I could reach their customer service through the phone.  Every single time I called, been hanged by automatically.
On 04/03, finally the phone call went through, I told the person who took my phone call that I required refund. He told me I could have a voucher.  I told him that I didn't know when the situation would be over. So I wanted refund, if I could go, I definitely would book again. Till 05/11, I still didn't get my refund back, so I called again.  The guy who took my phone call said they issued voucher, so they couldn't refund me.  I told him I required refund not voucher, b because nobody knows when we could travel again.  After 33 minutes phone call, finally he said they would cancel my voucher and refund the money. But until this very moment, they still didn't refund my money. So I called them again, and they told me I’d never asked for refund but voucher. What a liar. If I wanted voucher, I could do it online instead of calling especially kept calling.
I know Iberia airlines the ticket is about maybe $100 cheaper, but it's really not worth it, because when things happened, they definitely won't help you. I really feel that airlines of the US’ customer service would be way better.

Pleasant for a 12h+ long flight,Madrid,Tokyo,International,"I flew with Iberia from Madrid to Tokyo-Narita on the 9th of November last year. Check in was easy - you scan your passport via a series of machines you'll immediately see right when you enter Terminal 4, these machines will detect automatically your booking info and spit out your boarding pass. If you need to drop off checked bags you do so at a bunch of counters right behind the machines.

Flights towards international destinations take off from T4S, which requires a short hop on the shuttle train. After a long nap at the lounge I headed over to my gate, where boarding would begin an hour later. Boarding was slightly chaotic but not horribly so.

The seat was a bit tight, I'd imagine it'd be fine for on a six hour flight to NY but it gets quite cramped after that. The IFE touchscreens are new and work very well, and are packed with content.

First meal service began 2 hours into the flight with a choice between ""Japanese"" and ""Western"" meals - I chose the latter, it was quite tasty. Paper straws were given for the drinks. After that drinks were available in the rear of the plane for the flight up until the very simple breakfast, which was served in a box. Finally, an hour before landing, we were given a small, not very tasty sandwich along with a drink.

The plane was decently clean, however 9 hours in it had become slightly humid which made my attempts at sleeping nigh impossible. Bathrooms were also clean and had basic amenities.

We arrived at Narita on time at 9am, disembarkment was also slightly chaotic but again, not too much.

Thanks for the non-service,Brussels,Lanzarote,Europe,"I cannot emphasise enough how unhelpful and verging to indignation their response has been so far. Our flights are apparently not affected but we cannot fly due to both travel restrictions form our country of origin, and also because of entrance limitations in Spain, however the airline’s response has been “we don’t care, none of our business, bye”. I did not ask for a refund but merely some flexibility, be it on open dates (while paying the difference) or via the issuance of a voucher, but they had none of that. The customer service itself, in substance and appearance, was abysmal and profoundly unhelpful. That is simply not how a customer base is built or served best.

My Iberia Experience,Washington DC,Porto,International,"Hello friends, 

We took a family vacation last summer in 2019 and visited Portugal through Iberia Airline for the very first time. On our way back my checked in luggage whose one side zipper was giving problems got lost and never arrived. It was a very painful experience as it lasted for 26 days of me calling Iberia every single day and patienltylistening to the same verbiage again and again. From delayed status it changed to  lost which meant I had to document each and every item packed in my bag along with its approximate value and if possible receipts as a proof. The staff at Iberia were convinced the bag got picked up by another passenger by mistake or got stolen and there was little hope of its return. So I filed my claim with a very heavy heart as I didn't want to get compensated I just wanted my things back. Things that held emotional value for me as they were attached to memories I didn't want to loose.
Long story short on the 26th day during my routine call the representative started describing the contents inside my bag which matched my description and suddenly my bag was found! IT was in the Porto airpot for all these 26 days never got loaded in the plane and the staff just missed it!!! Yes, very frustrating but Im not complaining. It was sent back on the American airlines flight the next day and to my surprise my broken zipper help up and all my items were there. To make this ending more sweet Iberia mailed me a compensation check for $1,100 US dollars for the inconvenience I went through.
So my comments about Iberia is an average flight experience with a competent and fair customer service department.

I had bought trip/flight insurance at same time from Hopper. Aon refuses to cover as a ""claim"" and appearantly is underwritten by Nationwide Ins.

ABANDONED IN GUAYAQUIL - NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT,Guayaquil,Lisbon,International,"Due to the Pandemic Crise me and my friend  had to buy a flight to go back home and called Iberia in order to check that we would be given help in case everything had gone badly and our flight had been canceled.. This airline support assure they would help us return home in any way they could. With this in mind we chose Iberia to fly back home.

When we finally got this answer - which shouldn't count as one - we had been waiting outside the airport for 2 hours and the embassy told us we had to leave Guayaquil ASAP so we had to assure our way home through a different way. 

We had to buy very expensive flight tickets, passed through 5 different airports hopping not to have nor catch this highly contagious virus because IBERIA was incapable of providing the support they were bound to and had previously told us they would.

COVID19-Spain,Miami,Madrid,International,"I booked my flights with capital one travel (a third party agency). My flight was due to depart to Madrid on  February 28 and return march 7 from Barcelona back to Miami. Since Tuesday February 25, I began to make contact with the airline since there had been new cases arising  of COVID19 in Spain. Fearing for my health, I decided to get in contact with the airlines to cancel my flight and get a refund.. due to the fact that this was an epidemic (at the time--which later became a pandemic). For the past few days before my flight I was bounced back and forth from Iberia to capital one travel. Neither of the companies wanting to provide any service of understanding. Iberia stated that since I booked through a third party agency, that THEY (capital one travel) had to give me my money back. When I spoke to capital one travel, they told me Iberia needed to provide a waiver for me to be able to receive ""credit"" for my flight (No refund). If I did not obtain a waiver I would have to pay a penalty of 275$ per person (this was a trip for two), in order to rebook and use the availably credit. I began to call Iberia more often, I was told to wait for the next day and the next day to see if the company came out with waivers since the conditions were changing by day. However, the morning of my flight (my flight departed at 7 pm), I was on the phone with capital one travel and Iberia nonstop. Neither representative were of any assistance. One thing that really disappointed me was the fact that when I asked the Iberia representatives to transfer me to a supervisor, they told me no and that my case didn't require a supervisor. I asked who else can I speak with that can get the supervisor on the line, the representative told me ""hang up and call again.""  I asked for the gentlemen's name (I still have it written down), and hung up and called again. The next representative that answered said the same thing and when he heard the frustration in my voice he then started to tell me that there was no supervisor there at the moment, I told him I could not understand how such a big company doesn't not have a supervisor there. Miraculously the supervisor, named Gabriella answered the phone. She did NOT let me speak to get my point across, she kept repeating the same thing, and was very dismissive, once again while trying to get my point across, the SUPERVISOR hangs up on me. 

Around the early afternoon I decided to show up to the airport to speak with the supervisor at the front desk of Iberia airlines. The situation was explained, she was very pleasant and told me she wrote a note there that states that I was there and the situation had been explained and that I would NOT be considered a no show. This was done ""supposedly"" to see if the airline over the phone or the travel agency could do something about my situation. I asked her to print a copy of the note she wrote but she stated that there were several notes there from my calls and that it would be too long to print. At the end, when I got home I reached out to both Iberia and capital one travel via phone and they both stated no note had been written. According to the representatives from capital one and Iberia the supervisor at the front desk--Natiuska, had not written any note. I came to realize this is possibly why she did not want to print the note for me to keep as proof. 

At 5 pm, I had no other choice but to cancel my flight and have to pay a penalty of $275 per person for when I have to rebook by Dec of this year. As explained several times to both capital one travel and Iberia, (even before COVID19 reached its peak), how do I have the certainty that this epidemic/pandemic will be resolved by then, and what if I cannot travel during these times. The world has changed tremendously in the last month. If I would've traveled to Spain I would've either been infected with COVID19 not knowing how it'll affect my health, been quarantined for months (stuck in Spain) due to others around me infected, or even brought the disease back to my home after my trip where I put my family at risk, my coworkers, and my patients (I am a nurse) at risk. 

I saw beforehand something that companies failed to open their eyes to. I had a fear for my life and for those of my family and these companies truly lacked the morality and understanding to recognize this. I am currently still having to pay for the original cost of the flights and then have a payment to make if I rebook, if I do not I lose the money I invested.

Charging different prices for luggage,Lima,Madrid,International,"We needed to buy 1 additional luggage in our flight. On the site Iberia.com there is a ""calculadora"" which calculates the price of your luggage and you can pay it through your reservation. The price was calculated for 60 dollars if paid on the airport or 55 dollars if paid online. I tried to pay online, but there was some kind of error due to which I could not pay online. 
Leaving Lima during the check in they charged us 110 dollars for the additional luggage. They told us we can pay it or leave the luggage behind. So we were pretty much blackmailed into paying the fee which we did not count with, because the official site said a different thing. When I tried to complain at the airport they said they cannot do a thing and I have to file a complaint online. When I tried to file a complaint online after the arrival, first I couldn't file a formular, they didn't respond to me on Facebook and they couldn't understand me over the phone. After a while later I managed to file a formular online, to which they responded, that they can't accept the complaint because when you pay online, they price in the facturation may differ. What? The calculator told me online that the price will be 60 dollars and later they charged 110 dollars on the spot. That's fraud. And when they reply, you can't reply back, because that's not how their customer service works. :)",December 2019,"March 30, 2020",1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,3.0
Corporate dishonesty at its worst,Madrid,Quito,International,"This flight was canceled, and European law states very clearly that the passenger is entitled to a refund in this case. Iberia doesn't really care about the law (I wonder if they adhere to safety regulations?) and preferred to deceive me into requesting a voucher by putting a link in the email that led directly to a page declaring that a voucher would be issued - no intermediate page explaining options, no final confirmation request, nothing. Unlike some other airlines that at least seem to want to retain clients, the Iberia voucher did not even include a bonus, i.e. was issued for the amount of the canceled flight, right down to the penny. It may be that Iberia, which wasn't the healthiest airline to begin with, doesn't expect to be around long enough to care whether it repels its remaining clients. It would be no big loss, as I have never had a great experience with this airline anyway.",March 2020,"March 30, 2020",1.0,,,,1.0,,,,

Also we had nearly two hours for change, the time in Madrid was quite short, due to the long ways and controls. We didn't have even time to go to a shop or drink a coffee.

Sadly on IBERIA the passenger must eat when the crew want you to if you wish to have a full lunch --if not you may eat snacks later.

I paid for some extra leg room on the flight, but it was a joke, there was no extra leg room. If what I had is considered extra leg room, I can not imagine what the passengers who had't none had suffered. I am of a slim built and not very tall, and I had to keep my legs bent throughout the flight, there was no space for even a half-stretch. The flight was the torturous 14.5 hours, it was not pleasant. I arrived to Lima in track-suit bottoms and a t-shirt. With my suitcase in Madrid, sent to me 24 hours later, I had nothing to wear to a dinner in Central, pre-booked 4 months in advance and the highlight of our stay in Lima. When the suitcase finally arrived, it was damaged. Ever since, I've been trying to get in touch with both BA and Iberia about the damage - to no avail. BA, which sold me the flight, maintain that the responsibility lies with Iberia.

We did this to avoid flying via the States what a  mistake! The  amount of space in economy was tiny so that when the people in front of us reclined their seat we had no choice but to do the same. We had less leg room than on Easyjet for a long 12 hour flight. We couldn't book our seats in advance or pay for extra leg room either we were crammed in like sardines. The flight was very uncomfortable the food was inedible, thank goodness we ate first at the airport.  The staff were lovely but the overall service was very poor, we were only offered one alcoholic drink and were told we couldn't have anymore.

 I physically handed it over to a staff member and yes you guessed it, they stole it. My IPad, all my clothes, toiletries and medication all gone. I was left with the clothes on my back. 
When I complained they gave me the run around. I posted information on their Facebook page and Twitter account and this is the picture one of their staff sent. Eventually after threatening legal action they admitted fault and paid me the minimum amount possible that would not have even replaced the bag, not the contents.

Absolutely horrifying.,New York City,Madrid,International,"Was on a long-distance flight from NY to Spain/ Portugal... and experienced THE worst flight experience of my life. (And I've been on at least 30 flights.)

Overall, the in-flight service was what ticked me off. First of all, when a passenger clicks the ""assistance"" button, don't you think there's a reason why they asked for a flight attendant?? These flight attendants not only did NOT come (until I flagged them down when they were walking by.. after 30+ minutes of waiting), but also - when passengers give up/ fall asleep - they have the audacity to just walk down the aisle and turn all the assistance lights off.

In my particular case, I needed water (to take time- sensitive medicine). I asked for an attendant, waited for about 45 minutes. Noone came to answer. Meanwhile, I hear plenty of talking and giggling and see them congregated at the back of the plane. Did you come here to work/ serve or chit-chat??? Then, when I finally got a hold of one lady (goodness gracious I wish I caught her name so I could expose her), she said - ""no water available"". What? Are you freakin kidding me.
So I flagged another lady down (about 10 minutes later), and asked her for water. She ROLLED. HER. EYES. at me. And said, ""yes we will bring you shortly"". Well, shortly never came. And I was so annoyed that I got up and walked to the back of the plane and asked for water.

They not only gave me half a cup... but literally shoved the cup at me and shouted, ""seat belt sign is on! go sit down please."" I said back, ""I asked for you to come to my seat and waited for almost two hours. Why is it so difficult to bring me water?""
And there was no apology... just a shoo shoo, motioning for me to sit down.

There's more I could say but hopefully this is enough for you to realize that their service is CRAP and I wouldn't board with their airline even if that flight was $100.

Iberia - seriously. Step your crap up and TRAIN your freaking flight attendants. I think I'm generally pretty patient (as I work in the Service sector as well), but this was absolutely ridiculous.

Iberia doesn´t receive one single star in its qualification. Complete disregard for customers interests,Madrid,Canton of Geneva,Europe,"Last Tuesday, March 3rd, 2020 at 8.13 pm, I received, not opening it till later, an email from Iberia notifying me that they canceled my flight to Geneva on Thursday at 9.30, only 36 hours ahead of the plane departing hour. Iberia didn't give any explanation. Iberia just switched me to the next available flight without asking whether the solution was viable to me. The options Iberia gave in their email were either calling a 901 number, that has a cost for the caller because it is not covered by the flat fee of Spain's residential phone operators, or reach them through a link provided in Iberia's email. The latter option didn't work as it returned an error message that I copied and have stored to present a formal complaint against Iberia. Also, this month's invoice from my phone service provider is going to prove that I spent 4 hours trying to reach Iberia on the phone, sometimes waiting up to 20 minutes or more till I would eventually hang up and try again. When I finally reached Iberia on the phone at around 24.00 hours, I requested the reimbursement of my flight ticket as I wasn't interested in using it two hours after my original flight was leaving. After the hour of the original plane had passed, I received an email of the kind that doesn't admit reply, telling me that they acknowledged my communication, that they had canceled the fight for a strike, and that they were sorry their option was ""tiring"" for me. The whole thing is outrageous, their paternalism: no detail whatsoever concerning the ""strike."" ""Sorry that it was tiring"" and that they would not pay for any of my extra costs. I don't get it.
Are they going to reimburse me for my canceled flight or not? That is the only thing I requested and care about. Iberia is public (as in that it is owned by private investors), part of a British group. Still, Iberia/Vueling has an actual monopoly on many of the best slots at most of Spain's airports, that they received when they were a Spain's estate owned company. And as a virtual monopoly, they only pay lip service to Corporate Responsibility and Customer care. No matter they render a disastrous service. When they make tonnes of money, their private owners make a bundle; when they had a hard year, they just cry, and the government comes running and compensates them out of the citizen's taxes.

We printed out our boarding passes ahead of time and had only carry-on bags, but apparently you still have to wait in line to see an agent, even if you aren't checking bags. They have to check passports, but unlike other airlines I've flown Iberia doesn't do this at the gate. So allow plenty of time! Even if you think you can go straight to the security checkpoint you can't. On the return trip we had to board a tram that took us to the airplane, but there was no directions given about whether to use the front or rear staircase of the plane, so it was just kind of a free-for-all, with people trying to get by each other in the tiny aisles, and of course it was just gridlock at some points. It would have been helpful to have a flight attendant saying everyone in row 1-27, you need to board in the front. Everyone row 28 and up use the back staircase.

So frustrating! A cautionary tale about 24-hour cancellations,Chicago,Santiago de Compostela,International,"I booked a flight with Iberia through American Airlines. I reserved a few extra legroom seat assignments for the super tall people in my family. Then I realized that the return flight was showing up very oddly on Iberia's website for different times than those shown on American. Because of the really weird time discrepancy, I decided I'd rather cancel and book something with a more trustworthy airline. I cancelled within the 24 hour time limit, received my money back from American fairly quickly, and received MOST of my money back from Iberia. For some reason Iberia REFUSES to return ONE seat reservation. What? Does that even make sense? So I've lost a random $50 on a flight cancelled within 24 hours of booking. Iberia's customer service is SO UNHELPFUL. It's like pulling teeth talking to those people. They just keep insisting that because my flight is cancelled that they can't do anything now.

Dr,London,Havana,International,"Initially very exited as the opportunity to stay over in Madrid for a couple of nights in our return trip. Good first leg of trip. Return very disappointed. The Madrid London tickets were for the morning 08:50 hours. To our surprise when arriving in the morning to the airport and printing the boarding pass they were for an Iberia express, at 18:25 hours. 
Never notified by Iberia of any changes. 
Useless information stand staff. Very unhelpful, although I reckon there would be not much they could do, minimal information could have been helpful. Getting through to claims online/ mission impossible as the flight we were sold did not appear  in any options on the pre-determined form. Had apparently been canceled a couple of weeks before.  
And I repeat: no notification from Iberia. 
Unable to claim via the initial booking for same reason. Their reply was in terms we are sorry for your inconvenience, we can cancel any flight, and that’s it. 
Despite buying online form Iberia. Their reply via the Facebook page is: we sent you a reply, if you are not satisfied go to: and gives me the same link I have tried endlessly before. 
I am very disappointed with Iberia. I had travelled with them before. A few times. i was very excited with the option given of London-Madrid-Havana-Madrid-London. I do not think I can trust  Iberia anymore. No only for not notifying us of such an important change, but For Nor Caring!!!
And worst part is the cumbersome, appalling system they have for you to make any claims. Or complaints. Or feedback at all.

Connected flights and luggage,Zagreb,Malaga,Europe,"Before my travel I red very bed reviews about this company and the tickets were already purchased so there was no going back. However, my expirience was not bad at all. The stuff on the airplane was very kind and helpful. The pilots were very good and all four of our flights were very comfortable and on time.

We transfered flights in Madrid and we had only an hour between flights but managed to catch our flight to Malaga on time due to the fact that we didn’t have to switch terminals because Iberia has it’s own terminal at Madrid airport (in this case we were landing and flying from T4). The problem was an hour wasn’t enough for them to move our luggage so it was left in Madrid (the same thing happened with all the other passangers who were on the same connected flight from Zagreb to Malaga). Luckily at Malaga airport there was an Iberia custommer service desk and they were also very kind, took all the information about out suitcases and our location so they delivered our luggage with the first flight next morning and brought it to the hotel we were staying at. So that could have been a very traumatic experience, but they managed to make it okey. They also have a person there who takes care of the luggage himself when this happens and that was very helpful. 

On our way back to Zagreb we had a two hour pause between flights (also in Madrid) and that was enough for them to move the luggage so our suitcases came to Zagreb  normally. 

The main point is, when flying with this company, I strongly recommend either taking a longer pause between flights or just bringing your hand luggage because it is very likely for your luggage in hold to be left behind on such a small pause as 1 hour, although they say 45 minutes is enough for them to switch luggage. The good thing was we took travel insurance on our own and we managed to get over 100 euros beucause our luggage was more than 6 hours late so that’s definitelly another thing I recommend.

In addition, when flying with a connected flight like this one, you do not have go through any security checks again between flights, just passport control. This was another info I wasn’t sure about before my flight.

After I booked it, they email me a booking confirmation and clearly mark we will have meal and free check bag in the LEVEL flight. Later, I received the flight ticket number together with the itinerary. It all different in this email. It is no free check bags and no meal serve in the flight !!!! 
I use my confirmation code to check my fight in Iberia.com. It still clearly mark the free luggage and meal including in my return flight.
For safety, I call the airline ( of course long hold) and like to make it clear and forward back the conformation email to them as that agent instruction. After couple days, no respond. Call them again, then just told me in their system is show we don’t have mean and free check bags and ignore what the confirmation email. Even I go back online now, it did show sane day same route at same price, also clearly mark it has free check luggage and meal in basic fare for both flight.
I feel really not happy not regarding I need to pay extra for meal and luggage which I always did if I booked the low cost flight since it clearly told you before you buy. For Iberia airline, it tell you what you will get but not honor in that, it is fraud & cheating.I will never use this airline in future.",February 2020,"February 25, 2020",1.0,,,,,,,,

Never fly Iberia,Malaga,Valencia,Domestic,"We purchased a normal economy return flight from Malaga to Valencia for two persons including 1 checked in luggage each, and Iberia acknowledged this purchase in writing by receipt. However, when checking in Iberia refused to carry the two pieces of luggage without extra charge claiming that luggage was not included in the ticket, despite our protests and purchase receipt that clearly states the inclusion; and we were informed that that we had to complain to Iberia afterwards. Clearly, if we did not wish to travel without our luggage we had no other choice than pay an additional fee for the luggage, which was as much as the flight-ticket itself. Such a business behavior is usually described as fraud. Afterwards we explained the case to Iberia online via their “complaint” site and claimed a refund of the wrongly charged extra luggage fee. They simply dismissed the claim without any explanation, and upon a second (and third) complaint asking for a factual explanation for the refusal, we just received a standard (autogenerated?) answer of refusal that the case had been settled. Having traveled the world for more than 40 years, this is the first time I have been downright cheated.

Apparently you cannot fly to Spain with a passport that expires in the next 90 days. Okay, fine.

It’s a weekend and the office is closed so the earliest we can go is Monday. At that point, by the time we got there, we’d have to fly right back home. Same attendants say they will let us on a later flight (our next work break) for free. Call customer service, they say. We called customer service 3 times. according to them it is NOT free and the fee is more than the original tickets we purchased. Might I mention that Iberia let us enter our passport info, expiration date included, not only when we purchased the tickets 6 months in advance, but when we checked in to our flight the day before.

finally got seated, took off and then I learned the full definition of Fast Food, the trolley truly whizzed down the aisle with the food almost flying in front of you quickly followed by the drinks (choice of one small beer or one small wine or a soft drink).

This was rapidly followed by the rubbish collection, quite a few including myself declined to throw away the still semi full trays to be met with a withering glance.

There were 2 delays resulting in 4+ hours of waiting.  The final gate arrangement involved moving EVERYONE to a different gate by tram.  The second half of the folks waiting with us did NOT make it across the tarmac to the new gate because of the airport bus.  We did make it  however & were shocked the flight crew closed the airplane door without almost half of the passengers.  They (rightly) rallied the people at the gate and suceeded in getting the onboard crew to reopen the aircraft door.  It was extremely stressful.   When we arrived at Barajas airport we were late for our connection to London.  Having been rebooked on a slightly later flight we arrived an hour before our London to New York flight was to leave which we were releived about until we were told (by British Air) that Iberia released our seats & the flight was full, AND it was too late anyway.  They referred us to the Iberia desk and they made arrangements for us to stay overnight in London at their expense since there weren’t any other flights leaving.  This was no luxury side trip.

Thus, I cannot really recommend this airline anymore unless they improve spacing in seating.

Scruffy - disappointing and dreadful in-flight food,Madrid,San Juan,International,"As part of a cruise departing San Juan we were booked by the cruise operator on a return flight from Glasgow to San Juan flying via Madrid (out) and Philadelphia (return).

The leg from Madrid to San Juan was bearable but just - plane was quite scruffy looking (which influences reluctant flyers like me) and pretty uncomfortable for such a long flight - they cleverly co-located two families with infants close to us - several rows back there were a number of empty seats gobbled up by those closest in a bit of a free for all where passengers seemed to take control - one family were very lucky and a combination of the child's behaviour and their support for the child meant nearby passengers were troubled little. The second family seemed to disregard their child and the disruption it caused to all around. Couple that with dreadful food, staff disinterest, poor in-flight entertainment services meant we were really delighted to get to San Juan. We had earlier flown from Heathrow to Madrid with Iberia. 

These feelings were compounded when we flew with American from San Juan to Philadelphia and onward to Heathrow with BA.

All of this reinforced our view that we should take control (as we normally do) of travel arrangements where we can - this will ensure Iberia remain on our list of airlines to avoid if at all possible.",January 2020,"February 20, 2020",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0

Bottom of my list for Business Class travel,San Jose,Madrid,International,"New A350, so a nice plane with good seats (though a little lacking in privacy) and reasonable Wifi. But the dining experience was pretty dreadful, particularly on the inbound  flight. The Cava did not match the quality of Champagne served on BA, Quantas, Cathay and, in the distant past, American, so on the inbound flight I opted for a Bloody Mary, to which no Tabasco was added. However, the pre flight drink was served with nuts or stuffed olives, which were very good. The food that followed was appalling - cheap, badly cooked and largely lacking in flavour. Starter included an anaemic cold soup, salad (mainly old lettuce, and some sliced olives - it had nothing to recommend it) and what looked and tasted like processed cheese garnished with a very sad and very dry shrivelled prune.
Main course was some rather dry salmon with some cooked shredded carrot and cabbage, I think, all swimming in a watery liquid - the constituents of which I could not determine. Dessert was chocolate ice cream or ‘vanilla cake’. The latter resembled a small bowl of super sweet artificial cream, quite revolting. 
Cabin crew were all pleasant but the dinner service was very rushed (unnecessary on a 9 1/2 hour flight) the emphasis appearing to be on getting the cabin lights out as soon as possible to minimise customer demands on cabin crew. By 8.30pm we were all needed down for the night.

Always a mixed experience with Iberia,London,Madrid,Europe,"Our flights (round trip from Madrid) were changed three times between booking in February and flying in November. 
On one occasion, despite all flights being on one booking, our changed flight would have no way given us enough time to transfer to the domestic leg of the flight so I had to call the airline, does nobody actually check this?
We were offered a paid upgrade the day previous to the flight which we paid for.
I had booked two extra checked bags way back at the time of booking but was told at check in they did not have this in their system. Even though I had all my receipts etc printed off, we still had to endure a half hour delay checking in while they tried to sort it out, we were initially told we would have to pay again for the bags, I stood my ground and refused.
The delay meant we had no time to utilise the lounge which we were entitled to due to the paid upgrade.
Once on board the flight was excellent, delicious food, much needed drinks and friendly crew.

I’ve traveled with Iberia many times,Boston,Alicante,International,"I have traveled with a couple different international airlines. Iberia is my go to choice when going to Spain. 

The flight attendants are always pleasant, every time I have arrived earlier than expected, and they actually have very good food.

I know Iberia doesn’t look the cheapest but when you factor in the service and what you are actually getting it is one of the best choices. When you look at a flight with Norwegian (for example) it seems much cheaper, but with Norwegian you don’t get nearly as much as you do with Iberia. Iberia doesn’t have all of the hidden costs like some airlines. 
Flying the most basic, cheapest way you will be given; a blanket, a pillow, headphones, a full lunch/ dinner meal, a starter drink, coffee and/or tea after your meal, and a refill of coffee/tea, then a second smaller meal/snack with coffee/tea a few hours later. (This is for a longer flight, a one hour flight won’t give you these things) 
The larger meal consisted of salad, bread roll, tortellini stuffed with cheese or meat, and a piece of dessert cake item. 
The small meal is a crossaint sandwhich, a candy, and a yogurt, and usually some other small item. 
When you buy the tickets you can specify if you have special dietary needs. I have put a lactose free option in mine before and they are good about bringing you everything lactose free.

Flight wise, I feel that Spanish pilots tend to fly faster, but that’s an opinion not a fact haha. I have experienced turbulence on a flight but I don’t blame pilots for that sort of thing. Spanish flight attendants are more attentive than Spanish waiters— it will not be American service, or British service, because that is not the Spanish way. I do believe that the service is very good if you judge based on Spanish customs. 

I have always been satisfied with Iberia’s services and flights. 

I have flown with them multiple times and will continue to fly with them in the future. 

Last tip; buy a plane ticket three months in advance for international flights, and travel on week days as this will make the tickets cheaper.

IBERIA making efforts to be better than in the past,Mexico City,Madrid,International,"coming and going to south America from Europe IBERIA was among the only company to have regular flight to go there.

I recently tray again IBERIA with a range of brand new planes, with space for the legs, rather good service and wine on board. it was a good surprise as arriving on time.",December 2019,"February 2, 2020",4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0
DISASTAIR!!!,Tel Aviv,New York City,International,"My niece was getting married so my mother booked round trip tickets for me from JFK to TLV with a super long stopover in Madrid in each direction, not realizing that my return ticket was on Super Bowl Sunday, and that I'd be arriving to JFK at 7:15PM, which means I'll be missing a quarter of the game at the minimum.
My 30 hour trip arrived in TLV on Tuesday night 1/28/20 at 11:30 PM and the wedding was Wednesday night so I set out to call the airline - Iberia - on Thursday to discuss a change. Sure enough they were closed and wouldn't be opening again until Sunday, the day of my flight, which would be taking flight at 6:00AM. And to make matters worse, Iberia offices aren't open anywhere, and the numbers they have listed on their website do not work, and if you call their 800 number from out of the US, it also does not work...
So I get to the airport super early on Sunday Morning 2/2/2/ and ask the Iberia desk agent to give me pricing for the change. He says he is just a desk agent and I need to wait until my layover in Madrid to speak with someone who can help me. And then the magic begins...
In Madrid, I am directed to Iberia Airlines customer service lines in Terminal S, Sections 15 or 39.. I went to both. The first agent said my ticket was non refundable, which I knew, and then said the change would cost me more than the ticket we paid for all 4 legs of my trip. I asked how that could be the case and showed the agent my booking confirmation - and the disclaimer at the bottom which clearly specifies ""change allowed at any time with a penalty of 200 Euros or $250, except in the case of not showing up for the flight (no show) which does not allow change.""
the agent proceeded to give me a series of nonsensical responses, including the concept that my disclaimer only applied to tickets in my category, meaning that they could charge me 2000 Euros for this change alone. I asked who was telling her this info and she refused to divulge. Said I can pay the large fee or accept it. Not very accommodating! I asked how they can dismiss the disclaimer on my booking confirmation and she actually got angry with me, as if I was doing something wrong. 
I went to the next desk on the other side of the terminal to get a similar response, this time they were only trying to jack me with a nominal expense of $735 to make the change to my ticket. I asked how they can respond to my disclaimer that says I can do the change for a Max of $250. she said there was nothing to discuss. Unfortunately I cannot afford to spend that much on a change so I had to walk away..
I found a third Iberia information center, at the entrance to terminal S, to learn that we were now within an hour and a half of my flight and they could no longer sell me a ticket because I would not be flying with my luggage. All in all FORCING ME to sit in the airport for 8 hours, unnecessarily, even though I had been attempting to change my flight for 4 DAYS!!!
I get the fact that I bought a cheap ticket and have to deal with the consequences, but there's something so off-putting about Iberia's customer service and how they treat Americans. They don't have patience, talk down to us. There is barely any effort to assist, they dismiss your struggles and complain to each other that were not listening to them... 
I am now watching the early flight take off as I write these words, and am gearing up for another 5 1/2 hours of banging my head against the wall in Madrid airport, because of Iberia's incompetence and lack of interest to process another sale for their airline. 
I will honestly never fly Iberia again, and pretty confident I will never visit this stupid city again anyways. But it's not about that..
1) HOW COULD THEY LIST ON THE BOOKING CONFIRMATION THAT I CAN CHANGE MY FLIGHT FOR $250 AND THEN WHEN I TRY TO DO IT I AM TOLD THAT THIS IS NOT THE CASE? HOW CAN THEY DO THAT? 
2) HOW CAN AN AIRLINE NOT BE REACHABLE BY PHONE FOR 3 DAYS???
3) HOW CAN AN AIRLINE EXIST WITH SUCH HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE?

There was no options listed at all on the computer intro, you just went straight into the wait line for general customer service.  But no one was interested in helping us on a Saturday afternoon, that was obvious.  Called Iberia's UK number twice. Because we'd booked through a third party online site (who also apparently couldn't help us cause it was the weekend) we were told can't help you.  The fact they had changed the flight, which their system should not have allowed as it was a continuous ticket booked to Toronto, was irrelevant to them.  We finally had someone in the UK begrudgingly remove the Malaga-London portion of the flight so that all our return flights were not cancelled as a result of no show.  We then had to book a new flight from Malaga to London at extra expense.  Iberia informs us they aren't responsible for a refund even though they caused the problem.  The third party site has finally acknowledged they need to refund us but can't be bothered to respond to us if that is in process.

No welcome drink

2 of 3 food options sold out at 6th row and ending up vegetarian menu. 
Screens and handset super slow reacting, had to be restarted.

Very low quality of food. - there are served similar food on tourist class of majority of other airlines.

Cold soup served from the plastic can. 
Dry and hard bread. 
No option to get butter for the bread.
No water to have during night.

At serving - zero human contact - not one word said or asked, throw the plate and leave..

During flight the crew stayed 99 % of the time chatting together in the front cabin - not one question of a drink or offer for any snack of any kind.

If you wanted to go to the bathroom you had to “squeeze” your way past the full chatting crew as no one really noticed a “client” would like to use the bathroom. Again not a word spoken, fully ignoring.

If you wanted a water or a snack you had to get up and go to the front cabin where a poor selection of 2 mini snickers 3 other mini chocolates and some pre-baked and plastic packed low quality “snack” was lying on the top of a food cart... water and juice you could poor yourself... again full crew didn’t ask a thing or wanted to help as they were to busy talking together about private issues.

During the flight 2 of the very overweight crew members basically hammered the shoulder of me and the person in front every single time passing by as they had difficulties passing in the hallway due to the sheer size. No “I am sorry “- again zero communication.

When asking for a pen to fill out the immigration card was denied as they did not have a pen I could borrow.

Not a single smile from any crew member. Seemed to be very tired of the job to say the least.

I paid a huge amount of money on a business ticket - and receiving this really low quality experience and 100 % lack of service.
This “ Business” flight was under performing in each single area.

DO NOT book with Iberia,New York City,Madrid,International,"I have flown all the the world and used many different airlines.  I have never had such a horrible customer service experience in my life!

Terror on the Runway!,London,Madrid,Europe,"We taxied to the runway...

At some point the pilot attempted to fire up the engines to take off.  Just as they started speeding up and it felt we were starting to move... suddenly whole cabin went dark and engines died.  The pilot repeated this process another 2 times.  Each time just as the engines got loud...  Power off!  Eventually the plane limped its way to the gate (towed I assume), so the engines could get started there.  I guess it had the aeronautic equivalent of erectile dysfunction. The idea that we had to fly on a plane that couldn't even get off the ground caused a lot of concern in the cabin. Genuine fear.

The cabin crew spoke exclusively in Spanish so I couldn't follow the conversation well, but a number of passengers were very scared that the plane would crash and asked to be unloaded.  This caused an additional delay while their bags were unloaded.  I narrowly opted to stay on, having spent 30 min researching 'flying without APU' on Google.  The communication was poor, if the fault was explained better people would probably stayed on.

Overall we were 3 hours and 15 min late to arrive.  All this extra time was spent in the cabin, an anxious and fraught atmosphere with nothing except water.   I asked for something to eat and was refused. Once in the air staff then wheeled out some overpriced and horrible food (worst I've had on any airline) which we had to pay for!  They must have made a killing out of this, as everyone was starving.  

Landed in Madrid at 1.30 am.  I don't blame the staff, but I do blame the Airline for a) dodgy old plane b) undetected fault found right at time of takeoff c) failure to provide an alternative plane (this was LHR T5) d) refusal to provide adequate food and drinks during delay. Never again!  

p.s. I tried to claim EU compensation for this flight. Iberia's website is the worst of any airline I've flown with (I'm including Vietjet aka 'the Bikini Airline' here).  It was impossible to claim as the form required an Iberia ticket number, but I have a BA ticket number (code share).

I have called every number possible and it's IMPOSSIBLE TO REACH A REAL PERSON. I spoke to one agent in baggage named Giovanni who was completely not helpful. Even the English speaking agents don't speak it well.

NOT GREAT! Would never fly with IBERIA again! Still waiting for a reply....,London,New York City,International,"Where do I start... We booked direct flights from a comparison website and we were redirected to Iberia, at the time all seemed great, we book direct flights (operated by British Airways) for a reasonable flights, 6 months in advance. A month before flying Iberia cancels the flights and left us no option but to go on redirected flights from London to Madrid and then to New York (this added an additional 8 hours to our trip if not more because of the wait etc.). The flight itself to Madrid was horrible, their website is only in Spanish so good luck translating if you are not fluent in Spanish. It took me around 3 hours to try and check in just because I had to translate via google each sentence, also booking a seat was a nightmare, bearing in mind that seats were available to each other they booked my seat separately from my partner and another passage we were with on purpose. Every time I tried to amend this, it didn't work or they were trying to charge for this. The service overall was poor and unpleasant, completely overcrowded and sitting with strangers as their seating was unusable online. They don't really care about you when you get to the desk with any complaint, all they care about is that they took your money and you deal with what is handed to you then and there. We are still awaiting an email response from the Iberia team for compensation as we paid for direct flights and that is not what we got. Be cautious when booking with Iberia as they can just cancel or change your flights whenever it suits them regardless of what you've booked, also good luck trying to get a response from them, its been over a month and I still don't have a reply.

Customer service that threatens to have you arrested,Barcelona,Madrid,Domestic,"Just horrible.

After missing a follow on flight with Iberia due to one of their planes delays, I went to find a solution at their customer service department in Madrid.

Waited in line for an hour and when I got to the desk she wouldn't even look be in the eye. Spoke to me like an animal and said she wouldn't help me the only solution is to go to the ticket office and buy another ticket (yeh, maybe when hell freezes over).

I was clearly in trouble, stuck in a foreign country, without knowing the language or where to go. Not one care was given, I was humiliated in front of a line of people behind.

There wasn't even an apology for the delay, I was being spoken to like criminal or a prisoner. When I asked to take her full name because I wanted to issue a written complaint she refused to give it. 

When I said I was going to take a photo of her to send to her superiors so they could know who she was, she and threatened to call the police and have me arrested. 

What kind of airline speaks like that?! It was in unbelievable. Real pirates of the sky. They'll take your money happily but don't expect to get much back in return.

Iberia pushes you to FlyEmirates,Barcelona,Guadalajara,International,"I flew inbound in Business and outbound tourist. The trip began not so well, as Iberia failed to produce boarding cards for the last leg of my trip with a company part of OneWorld.  That forced me to go to the counters of the connecting airline and stand in line with a short connection, adding to the overall stress. Remember, I was flying business... Business seats are good, not extraordinary in any case, while the food is edible.

On my return trip, when doing my online checkin I was offered a paid upgrade to business with I accepted. Bad idea. Very bad idea. The website wouldn't allow me to finish the checkin because of an ""unknown error"". I called customer service and they informed that I had to go to the airport to pay for the upgrade. But not any airport, Madrid airport. Bear in mind that I was flying from Mexico to Madrid. Amazing. I asked then not to sell me the upgrade but to return to my previously assigned (and paid for extra) seat. Impossible.  At the end, when the airline finally issued me my boarding cards, it was no longer business and it was't my assigned seat either. To this date, one month after the fact, Iberia hasn't returned me the extra fee for the assigned place, nor even admitted wrongdoing.  

I should also add that while the economy food is totally inedible I advise you to bring your own lunch.

Good experience,Doha,Madrid,International,"We relocated from Ecuador to Qatar, and the flights purchased for us by the hiring company included a flight from Quito to Madrid with Iberia. 
We travelled with the whole family and we were loaded with luggage. Wife, our 2 months old son and our cat. You can imagine the logistics of travelling with a 2 month old baby and a cat.
The airline staff was quite nice and helpful, especially the stewardess in our alley, she was very sweet and helpful with all baby and cat issues once we were on the plane. 
The only reason I'm not giving more stars is because the boarding process was very slow and they didn't consider us to board first. Separate lines for families like us, but once you passed the counter you realized all lines merged in the same boarding hallway.

The fly was delayed by 20 min. and the transportation from the airplane to the terminal was very difficult or to be clear horrible, slow and inefficient .  As a frequent flyer this is not the first time that something like this happen to me, but in prior experiences a representative from the airline has assisted us at the gate and had help  us to to find the best options to resolve our travel needs. This was not the case. They were not one representative at they gate.  After Customs and  with extreme difficulty I finally found a representative from the airline. This representative  was disrespectful, arrogant and with a total lack of empathy . They automatically put us in a plane next day without hearing our plea to help us to get there earlier. We lost thousand of dollar in transfer and other activities. In another kiosk at my insistence we ask for an earlier fly. I was able to confirm 3  of 6 seats.

Notorious for losing luggage! Avoid!!,Berlin,Quito,International,"I flew from Berlin to Quito with a transfer at Madrid. Both flights were with Iberia. Both flights were delayed and I had to hurry to make the transfer in Madrid.

I had to stand in line for a long time and was told I had to return to the airport the next day to collect my luggage. When I told the locals about my experience, they said it happens all the time with Iberia. The next day when I collected my luggage, a woman next to me told me it was the 8th time this happened to her with Iberia!! 

I went to their customer service desk, which was VERY MUCH HIDDEN at Quito airport on a secret 3rd floor, only to discover there was nobody there and the door was locked, even though it was during their opening hours.

Avoid This Awful Airline At All Costs,London,Santiago,International,"We arrived in Santiago but our luggage did not. Whilst we accept that mistakes happen, Iberia could not manage to locate our luggage and deliver it during the 17 days that we were in Chile. This is some of the most appalling customer service that we have ever come across from any company. From speaking to people that we met in Santiago, it turns out that Iberia are notorious for losing luggage and poor customer services. Of the 5 people that we met who had flown with Iberia before (admittedly a small sample but telling), 4 said that their luggage had been lost on flights between Europe and South America or vice versa.

Iberia's customer services are extremely unhelpful and often quite rude. They send customers virtually no information without having to be chased. They ignore Emails and WhatsApp messages, sometimes for days. When contacted by telephone, all of the information that they provide is conflicting, often they are unwilling to give any information at all. On the occasions when they do oblige, they often simply read information off a computer that is days out of date and refuse to engage further when corrected on their errors. There does not appear to be any organisational mind guiding the whole process, and they do not appear to have any basic system of conveying information from one member of staff to another.

The company's logistics are also unbelievably poor. It appears that our suitcases were eventually lost during our flight change in Madrid, which Iberia fly directly to Santiago from- we would have expected them to be sent to us on the next flight the following day. However, we understand that our cases were sent to Bolivia for some inexplicable reason, despite us having no link to that country (we only know because were contacted by staff at the airport in Santa Cruz de la Sierra). The cases were located in Bolivia, but then lost again, at one stage we were told that one had gone back to Madrid and one had been lost. At another stage we were told that they had been sent to one of Colombia, Venezuela or Aruba. When we eventually gave up and demanded that they be returned to the UK, they were not delivered for five consecutive days and we eventually had to go and collect them from Heathrow Airport ourselves. When we got there Iberia told us they were not there, but then took a matter of minutes to locate them when we insisted that their member of staff go to the luggage room.

Lost luggage due to staff oversight,Munich,Madrid,Europe,"First time we flew Iberia and it was not a great experience. I flew with my family but for whatever reason they failed to scan my boarding pass in the airport in Munich.

When we arrived in Madrid and discovered my luggage never arrived, I was told that it was because I had been recorded as a “no show” and my luggage was taken off the plane in Munich.

My question is that how it could be that none of the air crew checked before the plane took off. We were seated in the plane for 30 minutes before takeoff and my family was with me. A simple check would reveal we were traveling as a group so surely someone should have come to enquire with the rest of the group if one did not show up? Or would they have done a headcount check? Or just come to the seat to check...?

Anyway, the luggage was delivered more than 48 hours later and I was not impressed. The ground staff at both airports were neither helpful nor polite.

We tried to call for information many times to the 24/7 number given to us but only very much later discovered that the number does not respond to foreign number phones! I can’t understand the rationale for this as surely they must expect non-Spanish citizens to also travel on their airline...? We called through an EU number by the way, so at least they should allow for EU residents traveling on their planes.

To make matters worse on our journey on the way to Cuba the flight attendant that served us was rude and completely unsympathetic to our situation.

When we arrived in Cuba we were welcomed with none of our luggage because stupidly the company allowed only a 45 minute gap of time between getting off our flight from London to Madrid to picking up our next flight from Madrid to Cuba, which also landed late so we had even less time to pick up our connection.

We were also without food on our journey back to Madrid, and our flight attendant informed us they again received no notification of our request for vegetarian food, but thankfully he was polite and sympathetic to our situation which made it slightly easier to be bearable.

Awful experience!,New York City,Rome,International,"My family and I flew from JFK to FCO using Iberia airlines with layover in Madrid with codeshare through AA (AA 8864) on 9/20/19.  Where do I begin?  There seemed to be a large group of students in their early teens (possibly a large class trip) with their chaperones on this particular flight, which I think they’ve never flown before based on what I and other passengers experienced (these group of kids were from Spain).  When I boarded the plane and making my way to my seat, I couldn’t make my way up the aisle because of one of teenage kids’ luggage was in the aisle blocking passengers from moving further up.   Additionally, another female student walked across the aisle from her seat to her friend to chit chat with her while she and the luggage was blocking my way to my seat.  I had an unhappy look on my face and looked at the adults near these kids.  Thankfully, one of the chaperones told the female student to move out of the way.  Throughout the entire flight, 20 or so students were standing up in their seats talking to other students in other rows.  They all kept walking up and down the aisles.  During landing and taxing, the students would be out of their seats and open the overhead compartments.  

Unfortunately, I encountered the same group of students from MAD to FCO.  Same fiasco as was the flight from JFK to MAD (AA 8820).  When at the baggage claim at FCO, the students had picked up my mothers luggage thinking that it was theirs but saw that it wasn’t, they just left it out of the carousel unattended rather than putting it back on the carousel.  

The flight attendants on both flights did not do a darn thing telling students to sit down or to not wander around on the plane!  When I got off on both flights, other passengers were complaining to the flight attendants but it seemed that the flight attendants didn’t care.  These students had no flight etiquette nor respected other passengers.  It was very dangerous and a violation of safety!

Cannot recommend due to checking in,Madrid,New York City,International,"I just wrote about Iberia Express with terrible customer service then my next flight was on this one with the same. If their customer service was good I would give a different rating. As it was a very nice, spacious, clean aircraft with a smooth fight with excellent pilots. 
I was not happy from our original booking on American Airlines had us return to JFK by Iberia, especially with the horrendous experience on the Express, Flight 3823.
We tried for many weeks to make contact with Iberia by internet and long distance phone without any result, because we had to add a lap infant.
When checking in for almost an hour,  the agent did not know much English and was very rude. She had to find out that we did not need a visa for the US. We were checking the weight of one bag which was slightly overweight, but our other bags were all underweight. So we were just going to take something out when she put a tag on it and said I have to pay 260 euros if I want the bag to go. She said nothing about being overweight and that I should have done things online and we could not do that. She also stood up and was calling another customer when the other 3 had not been checked in.
Another agent took over with the checkin and said I should have never had to pay the 260 euros, but there was nothing that she could do. I have written a complaint to AA as Iberia’s complaint does not include checkin.
Sorry for going on, but this was the worse ending to my weeks cruise around the Canary Islands. I even tried to upgrade.

Only positive thing about Barcelona-Boston flight is that it was nonstop.  Besides that, Iberia was disorganized, with poor customer service and rude or dismissive staff at each step of the way.

Iberia suffers from extremely poor communication and service,Madrid,Granada,Domestic,"Over the last week, I flew Iberia from Miami to Madrid, Madrid to Chicago, and was booked for a flight from Madrid to Granada. For the long flights, the check in was very difficult (the app is the worst), people were rude, the food was 5/10, and the seats were not the best (6/10). 

We decided to fly business from Madrid to Grenada. For that flight, they changed the gate all the way across the airport 15 min before boarding. This involved 20 min of walking and going through security again. Annoying but not necessarily the airline's fault. We then got 5 emails telling us the gate kept changing back and forth. There were no gate agents to tell us what was happening, so we had to wait in mass at information. Eventually, they moved us to another gate 20 min after boarding was supposed to start. Then a delay was announced to us by email. An hour went by and we only found out information by the whole plane standing at the info desk to ask for answers... they just told us to wait. 
We went to the business lounge to figure out what was happening, and they told us the flight had been cancelled. They then told us they would offer us a bus later in the evening. We waited another hour and then were able to book a place on the bus at 18:30. The flight was supposed to be at 16:30ish. The bus was supposed to leave around 19:30, so we waited outside starting at 19:15. There was no sign of the bus until around 19:50. It turns out they couldn't fit everyone on the bus! We finally took off around 20:15 to Granada on a bus with no working bathroom. We arrived in Granada at 02:00! To summarize, we had a flight from 16:30ish to 17:30 and instead ended up on a bus from 20:15 to 02:00 with no money back.

Flight cancelled after FOUR gate changes and another partial cancellation for some on the rebooked flight.  Just. Don't.,Madrid,Granada,Domestic,"I realize that flights get cancelled.  Understood.  What was completely unacceptable about this Iberia cancellation was that Iberia put us through FOUR gate changes at opposite ends of the massive Madrid Airport on December 21, 2019.  We started off at K72, which only showed on the departure board about 40 minutes before our scheduled departure. When we got to K72, the gate attendant said to go to M37.  We hustled to M37 and there was no one there. There were six other passengers huddled around an Iberian employee, who had no idea how to check where our flight was departing from. My phone sent me no less that 15 text messages (total) from Iberia, sending us back to K72.  At K72, the attendant said M37.  Another lengthy run back to Terminal M, which includes a ten minute airport passenger metro train ride.  At M37, there was no one there.  A passing Iberian employee shrugged their shoulders and said ""if you hurry, you can make it"" as my phone buzzed AGAIN for K72.  My this time, we were moments from the scheduled departure time, my heart was racing, I was perspiring, and after checking later, we had race-walked TWO MILES with luggage. Only then did my phone, not an employee, inform me that our flight was CANCELLED.  It took another two hours to locate an Iberia help desk in Departures, wait our turn, get rebooked for the following morning, and get a hotel voucher after we ASKED for one.  Our Spanish skills are at an acceptable level and we were not behaving like a**hole tourists, we have travelled the world, but this was beyond the pale. The next morning, on the rescheduled flight to Granada, the plane they booked us all on was not big enough for accommodate all the rebooked passengers, so they bumped everyone who had a seat number above #20 from the night before.  People were livid and they had to have Security standing by. The next leg of our trip from Granada to Seville was by bus, and it was definitely a relaxing experience. Icing on the Iberian Airlines cake, when it was time to leave Spain, I couldn't complete my on-line check-in on my smart phone nor could I print my boarding passes, so I stressed until I got to the airport window in Seville and got all three boarding passes printed by an Iberian employee and into my hands.

I was one of the last passengers on board and there was no space for my carry on. The flight was preparing to leave and one of the male flight crew attendants suggested I just tuck my luggage under my feet or find space in one of the overhead bins.

He didn't seem to care where I put my carry on or if I would be comfortable or not. I was tired and didn't want to struggle to find space in an overcrowded flight so I just tucked it under my feet. Would he have suggested this if I had been a large woman?

As part of the crew, he should have offered to help me find space for my carry-on, but I guess that's what you get when you pay for basic economy.

Worst company ever! Outrageous! Very good at stealing peoples money!,Madrid,Bogota,International,"This is the worst company ever! It is Iberias common policy to change pre-booked and expensively paid for selected seats shortly before the flight. They just assign some random seats and thats it. Even if you tell them that the seats are needed for special care for disabled people, they do not care. Later, upon requests for reimbursement of the money, Iberia just states in an email that the seats were not changed even though numerous Emails have been sent with arbitrarily seat change information, Everything is clearly logged in Iberias system, but they refuse to reimburse the money.

The London-madrid was cancelled, in the whole Gatwick it was ONLY ONE Iberia representative to attend whole a whole cancelled airplane, who was not helpful and told us to call Iberia , Iberia customer service through the telephone told us to go to airport representative.

The trip that never was.,Boston,Barcelona,International,"I was scheduled to fly to Barcelona on 12/7/2019 with two friends.  We were waiting for boarding at on On December 7, 2019 We we’re waiting to board at the gate when delays were announced then the flight was cancelled for mechanical reasons.  After some confusion at the check in counter my friends and I were assigned to go to the embassy suites at Logan.  We were told that we would receive an email with our rebooking info.  This never happened. We did receive an email stating our flight was cancelled and would be rebooked. We were given a website to check but that didn’t tell us about when we would be rebooked.  The phone number provided rang then disconnected.  We called Iberia airlines they told us Level which is owned by Iberia would be rebooking our flight.  Meanwhile the hotel told me our stay had been extended one more night.

One of our party spent five hours at the airport on the 8th trying to rebook our flights.  At one point she had Iberia customer service on the phone while standing at the level check in counter. Iberia customer service said Level would rebook us, the person at Level said the person at Iberia was lying.  On Monday the hotel told us our stay had been extended until Thursday.  

Calling the airlines did nothing but frustrate us.  Iberia told me to call Level.  I looked up Level’s customer service number on the internet and when I dialed it I got”welcome to Iberia”.

By Monday, after receiving nothing from the airline s and being told our stay at the hotel was being extended to Thursday we decided to leave and do something else.  If we had been rescheduled to fly out Thursday we would have arrived in Barcelona on Friday and our return flight was on Saturday.

We lost money on our hotel in Barcelona and on some tours.  

This was the worst experience I have ever had traveling.  Other flights have been cancelled, and had been rebooked with no problem.  I have never received another email from Iberia/level about the cancelled flight.  I am disputing the charge for the flight with my credit card company.  I actually received more information from the hotel than I did from the airlines.

Increadible bad airline,Paris,Lisbon,Europe,"I booked my trip through an agency 'Go Voyage' with a trip from Paris to Toronto via Lisbon. The first fly was on 2019/12/20 with a departure time at 7:45 and an arrival time at 9:15, flying from Paris (Orly) to Lisbon (Lis). However, at the end the flight was delayed for about 5 hours. The real departure time was about 12:00 and with an arrival time of about 14:30. Moreover, many passengers cannot have a space for their hand-baggage on the airplane. Finally, I cannot catch my connection fly to Toronto. Furthermore, since I missed my connection fly to Toronto, all my later fly will be lost. The fly was actually operated by Vueling airline, but my ticket was sold by Iberia. Then I tried to have contact with the Iberia representative at the Lisbon airport. What I got is just one piece of paper with a phone number in Potugal. As mentionned on the website, they should provide english assistance, however the real case is that they only speak protuguese or spanish to me. Fortunately, I met a nice local family, they hleped me to communicate with Iberia company. After a very long time communication with them, they have no response for my situation. They said that it is not their business to pay me anything because I missed my connection fly. If I want to continue my trip to Toronto, I need to re-book another fly for the next trip.

Just do yourself a favor and don’t take Iberia.,Madrid,New York City,International,"Iberia airlines takes no responsibility for their actions or the passengers and their passenger’s belongings that are under the airline’s care. Just don’t take Iberia. They make you wait over an hour online to check in a CARRYON (against your wishes) only so their ground crew can break into it and steal what you may have forgotten to take out.  They make you return to the police numerous times to try to get it only to be told that the airline should know better than to ask that of its passengers since the police doesn’t know where the incident happened. When I had to go back to JFK to get a PIR code, their reps at JFK even suggested that’s what they are known for.  The customer service also says they should have received an itemized list of the contents BEFORE the flight.  If they’re making me check it in against my wishes then their reps @ Madrid airport should have done their job and asked for that list.   You can send all the receipts and proof that you want, you will get nowhere.  I was offered a little over $200 to make up for the close to $5k in clothing, jewelry and electronics that were stolen.  That amount doesn’t even make up for the suitcase and lock they broke.  Look at all their comments on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.  They are all filled with similar passenger complaints and no resolutions from the airline itself.

This went back in forth in the end we hustled to AA desk in Madrid even after the 90 minute mark which means you could lose your business class seat and checked bag. The AA agent confirmed she should have input the information, it was easy. She to redirect and tag my bag. If my flight in Rome had been delayed I could have missed my connecting flight.

Probably the worst... Ryanair maybe better,Seattle,Malaga,International,"Just returned (24hr late) from a trip on Iberia and it rates as one of the worst airline experience to date. I highly recommend avoiding this airline at all cost. Both coming and going we’re unbelievably screwed up and they offered ZERO assistance. After screwing up my ‘to flight’ and losing my bags I got to be yelled at, belittled and mocked by their customer support at the airport (after being awake for 36hrs). When I finally got ahold of a customer service agent by phone (no small feet on a US cellphone in Spain on a Spanish network) they told me they had no idea where my bag was and I should hope it shows up somewhere/ some time. This caused me to cancel my first day of vacation and basically hangout at the airport scouting out my own bag. Oh the kicker when I finally got my bag the agent said “we tried to call you, you gave us the wrong number”. I responded by explaining it was a US number, she cut me off to correct me and said “No it’s not a US number you gave us the wrong number” um ok. Also according to CS there are no supervisors to speak to so don’t even ask. 

Again on the way home there was a schedule change that made my connection impossible and I revived ZERO assistance from Iberia.

Mediocre company with no customer service. No words to describe what i lived,Lisbon,Panama City,International,"I have spent the last 12 hours in the airport of Madrid Barajas, on Terminal 4S waiting to be attended by Iberia. 

I don't have words to describe what happened. The Iberia flight Lisbon-Madrid was delayed and knowing that Iberia had passengers coming from Lisbon for the flight for Panama, instead of trying to wait for these passengers for the Madrid-Panama flight, they decided to go through with it. 

Let me tell you the flight Madrid-Panama was at 11:50, and the flight Lisbon-Madrid arrived at 11:40. Can you explain why not to wait in a day where Iberia knew there was a lot of delays in the airport?

But then all this gets worst: more than 100 people to be attended in the Iberia counter with two people only assisting that became just one person. 
I have almost 70 years old and after some hours when i wanted to try to solve this issue, when i went to the counter you had put the police to talk with me instead of you. You had put Police to get your clients far from having their problems solved. What you did was beyond anything i have ever seen.

And when at 10pm i was finally attended, the person in charge treate me and my husband with no respect, put me in the end of the plane when i had bought for today's plane seats in the front (70€ i have spent, i want that money back) and said she would not moove because it was ""not her fault"".

I have lost my money of tonight's hotel in Panama City and the dinner already that was already booked and paid (>300€). Who is going to pay me this?

I hope this solves quickly, because not only Iberia already damaged the holidays of everyone there today, but also had create for me a lot of money lose. Nevertheless, i am already in touch with my lawyer to sue them.

Food very poor,Montevideo,Madrid,International,"Aircraft was clean and tidy on boarding and left on time. We’d paid for extra leg room but even so my seat next to the window felt cramped width wise.

Our Spanish isn’t brilliant so when we struggled to understand what the hot food options were we asked if she could explain in English to which we got - “beef or pasta”. The beef was only luke warm at best and my husband couldn’t work out what was in his ravioli. Only came round once during the night with drinks - this was a 12hr flight - which was accompanied by a small sandwich of indeterminate filling squashed flat in cling film.

No one walked the aisles at any time to check on the welfare of passengers. No one, despite several crying babies, checked to see if the family needed any help. No one, despite a grossly overheated plane, walked the aisles with trays of water in case any passenger needed hydration.

When a little girl threw up just before landing, not a single flight attendant appeared to assist with the clean up...other passengers had to use what they could put their hands on to help clean the mess and to comfort the inconsolable child. I have never experienced such a poor standard of performance on any other airline. 

Another failure: no flight attendant responded to any of the four requests for assistance generated by using the FA call button.

To reiterate: the same behavior by the cabin crew happened on both segments of my Iberia flight.",December 2019,"December 8, 2019",2.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,,2.0
Worst I've flown with,Barcelona,Buenos Aires,International,"First of all, you have to pay for EVERYTHING from a coffee (3.5 euro) to a blanket (6 euro). Now apparently you can order food and drinks before hand, which I was not aware of. The crew completely ignored me when they came past with food and drinks. Did not even offer a single cup of water over the course of the 14 hour flight. Not only is this disgraceful service but it is also dangerous due to the risks of DVT. 

The seats were the smallest I have ever sat in for a long haul flight. Seat in front, once declined, sat about 20 cm's from my face. 

I also couldn't bag drop my bags early, like you can with most airlines these days. Had to wait until check in was open, despite already having checked in and tickets on me. Doesn't make much sense to have check in online, if the whole process is exactly the same at the airport whether you have checked in or not.",December 2019,"December 8, 2019",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0

Paige,Boston,Barcelona,International,I will never again travel with Iberia airlines and I urge others not to book with them. My flight was cancelled last minute and they kept us waiting at the airport terminal for over 2 hours. They tried to rebook our flight and sent us an email that was all in Spanish and I could not understand it. There was no option on the email to translate to English or go to a website to view the booking. There was also no option to cancel the booking on the email. At this point I would only be getting 2 days on vacation that was not worth it to me. I called to try to cancel and Iberia said I needed to cancel through the airline they booked even though they were the ones to make the booking.

On my flight back, I did the transfer in Madrid, I checked in my seat the night before my departure from Santo Domingo to Madrid, but when I was boarding in Madrid, the ground staff changed my seat without a reason, and then when I was on the plane looking for my new seat, turned out they changed it again, in the end I had to wait and see what’s left for me.

The headsets had a crackling noise rendering unusable. After dinner service none of the crew were visible. To make things worst our connecting flight from Madrid to London was cancelled.  The airline rep refused to check connections to give us a protection. Only gave us a phone to call Iberia or BA.
After 5 phone calls we managed to talk to a Supervisor who assisted us with last minute request.  We bought new tickets to fly Madrid to Jeddah to Singapore.  Iberia has no sympathy towards her passengers and very low concept of customer service.

Service is something unknown to them,Madrid,Venice,Europe,"Flight was full and as usual some guests had to carry on board all their belongings, making things difficult not only for the flight attendants but also for the rest of those passengers that had a single bag to store on the compartments above their seats.
It is frustrating for most passengers to have some people wondering back and forth on the plane looking for a suitable space for their luggages.  At this point, why all airlines don't oblige all passengers to store their bags in the cargo hold seeing that this unpleasant situation happens in every flight?  
Then I asked for some water but there was some turbolence on the border with France, and I was refused.  I waited for more than 10 minutes and asked the flight attendant to purchase 2 bottles of water but she said their service (she called it ""service"") was over and she could not do anything about it.  
I mean, even to prisoners in the death row water is served...

Rude,New York City,Madrid,International,"The pilot was fine, and I suppose that’s the most important thing, but some members of staff were just awful.  If you ever need to ask any sort of question you will be sol.  On my outbound flight to Madrid, I had requested a vegan meal.  Called the airline, spoke to a seemingly nice and helpful representative who took a few moments to do something and told me it was added, thank you, have a nice day.  It was not added and the crew at the airport and on the plane were really nasty about it when I told them I’d reserved a vegan meal.  They even went so far and to send the head crew member over to me well after mealtime was over to call me a liar and show me her list and loudly shout some other things in Spanish and walk away.  
My return flight, though booked through Iberia, was supposed to be operated by American.  However, due to a massive strike in Paris, we had to change our flight.  When we called Iberia to make the change I asked if my meal request (which I’d done online this times, weeks earlier) would be transferred.  The helpful, if somewhat brusque, lady told me that everything including the meal would be transferred.  And at the airport - there is no meal.  Which wouldn’t be the end of the world, but it was the nasty, accusatory, unnecessary behavior of the staff that turned it into a really unpleasant experience.

Blatantly lied to and Ignored for days,New York City,Barcelona,International,"I have been trying to book a flight for 3 days. Found the flight I wanted, exchanged my Chase points to Avios, only to find I could not pay for those flights with my avios. I figured I'd just call customer service and see what the problem was. They didn't answer. All day. Or the next day. I tried their US, Spanish, and international number (two of which are disconnected). I got through one time briefly, for the guy to tell me he couldn't help with points and gave me the correct number to call. It was disconnected. No answer when I called back. I also e-mailed, instagramed, and tweeted them (with two accounts) and no reply. Finally got a someone by calling British airways and having them transfer me to a guy named David (after being on hold nearly an hour). He said I just had the wrong browser. Hungup, tried new broswer, didn't work. I had found a separate flight that did accept Avios, but the website had a glitch that would let me enter info, but immediately clear it. I even got a video of it for proof. How badly this situation is going would be almost be funny if I were not so upset about losing $600 worth of points with nothing to show except for 9 hours of my life being wasted. At this point I just want my points back so I can use them on a real airline.

Avoid this airline at all costs,Florence,Madrid,Europe,"If I could give 0 starts for this airline I would. This is the worst airline I have ever traveled with by far. I’m having a hard time even coming up with the words to express how terrible this company is. I have traveled with this airline 5 times now and my opinion of the company has only gotten worse with each trip. From the quality of their customer service to the punctuality of the flights, this airline is a complete nightmare. I have been delayed three out of five times (For 7 hours total) due to issues which were the fault of the airline, not due to weather. Another time they were simply bumping ticketed passengers to a flight an entire 24 hours later to “balance the aircraft” (and not notifying those passengers that they had been moved until they were at the airport to check bags). On one flight they seated a handicapped passenger (who was unable to stand up) in the aisle before boarding the rest of the flight and forced the passengers in the window and middle seats to step over her, putting all three individuals in a very uncomfortable position. Another time I went through the process of purchasing a ticket online only to be shown a page that said an error occurred when I clicked the button to finalize the purchase. I called the airline to get help finishing the booking over the phone and was told that, not only would I have to pay a fee to have it booked over the phone (even though it was a problem with Iberia’s website that had forced me to have to book over the phone), but that the price had augmented to 3X the price I had originally been shown in the 2 minutes between the appearance of the page saying an error had occurred and getting a representative on the phone. They would not help me to complete my purchase for the price I had already started the process of purchasing. Lastly, on the last flight I took, the seats in economy had less leg room than I had ever seen on any plane in my life. I am not very tall (less than 5’8”) and there was barely one inch between my knees and the seat in front of me. I cannot imagine how anyone much taller would have been able to sit at all.

Flying Iberia Beware!!,Miami,Madrid,International,"Both flights Miami to Madrid and Madrid to Miami, We experience terrible service. Straight to the point, little water, no snacks in between meals, unpleasant flight crew on BOTH flights. Our Miami to Madrid: We traveled with our 1.5 old baby boy (purchased a seat for him on both flights) we accidentally left our recently purchased water bottle at the terminal prior to boarding. Asked a flight attendant a woman short ashy hair for water for baby’s formula, she smiled and said no! What?!? After take off my husband got up and went to get water!  Now, flight back home Madrid to Miami: A flight attendant apparently couldn’t understand we purchased a seat for our baby. We order the children’s menu since he already eats regular food (his meal arrived before everyone’s else) the flight attendant a man with gray hair or little hair kept asking our sons age meanwhile wouldn’t give my husband his meal. The other flight attendant had to let him know we paid for ours sons seat (over $500) he than gave a meal to my husband. If this flight crew had any doubt of my sons seat wouldn’t they check the passengers list before making a fool of themselves and making us feel as if we had claimed a seat without paying?!?

Lost Luggage,Beirut,Tenerife,International,"Yesterday (November the 16th), I took a flight  from Beirut to Tenerife with a stop in Madrid... to my surprise once I reached my final destination my luggage never arrived. (and I still haven't received it) 

After 40 minutes of waiting for it at the luggage conveyer belt, I realized it wasn’t there. I tried asking around and found an iberia desk eith an agent who reassured me by telling me that the luggage had arrived and that it was located in the floor downstairs, so naturally I went to that floor and searched for around 15 minutes but it wasn't there.
So, I went back to the agent to let him know that I still did not find my luggage and he told me that he would check again by himself. After having disappeared for over 20 minutes,  he informed me that it was still in Madrid.
So i had just lost 1 hour  searching for something that wasn’t even there ( after having flied for over 6hours, with an 8 hour layover so you can imagine how tired I was) 
I started wondering: Why did he tell me before to search for it elsewhere? Did he even check and track my luggage when I first mentioned it wasn't  there?

Anyway the agent took some information in order to send me luggage on the next day (today, November the 17th) and guaranteed that it will definitely arrive  on a plane coming from Madrid to Tenerife. I got reassured as I saw a flyer mentioning an award IBERIA (the airline I had just taken) received for its lost baggages management.

However, no one contacted me and I didn’t get any information on my missing luggage!
Therefore, I called IBERIA’s office located at Tenerife’s Airport through several  numbers and no one ever answered (one phone number wasn’t even working). I even called IBERIA’s headquarters office in England, and was given another number to call. 
I had again wasted 1 hour  between unanswered calls and automated answering machines for this same matter.
Until, I finally got my answer and to my surprise my luggage was still in Madrid even though the airport agent assured me I was going to get it by today!

I realize now how inconsistent this airport agent is, and how unprofessional and terrible IBERIA’s lost and found service is.

The worst part is that IBERIA is supposedly awarded for lost luggages management? All full of lies!!

We live in a century where time is money. I already wasted a considerable amount of time on this matter and I can’t afford wasting more of it to get respected and have my luggage back!! 
I am a very unsatisfied and disappointed customer, especially that it’s my first day at work tomorrow and don’t have a decent piece of clothes!

I will make sure to never take this airline again if given the choice and would certainly never recommend it.",November 2019,"November 17, 2019",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0

There was no kiosk checkin at OPO, even though several other airlines allowed it (including Vueling).  Instead there was a long line waiting to checkin at the IB ticket counter.  We waited, while watching the 2-4 IB agents sitting at there stations, laughing and visiting with each other.   They totally ignored their waiting passengers.

The Iberia flight from Chicago to Madrid was, for whatever reason, a pretty good flight.  Perhaps it was as simple as my mind being in a good place.  Also, I find the long flights to a place I want to go is easier than the flight coming home from that destination. 
I'm 5'11"" and 195 pounds and had an aisle seat.  It seemed roomy enough.  Right before take off I changed seats to the row right in front of me where there was no one in the 3 seat row.

Worst airline in history!,Dublin,Santiago,International,"I try to avoid Iberia like the plague but had no way around it this time. 
Our outbound fly was rocky because I ordered vegan meals and when the snack came, they gave me a sandwich with egg. I asked if I could be given something else instead and I was offered some fruit. 20-30 mins later it never came so I got up and asked. I was met by a very cross male cabin crew that informed that they didn’t have vegan meals but strict vegetarian and it was my DUTY to bring my own food (!). I told him that I booked my ticket through BA and I rang customer service 3 times, all in English as I live in Ireland and I was never advised of their “definition” nor that I should bring my own food. Note I travelled premium economy so you would have thought I would be treated a tiny bit better. I responded to him that as a company, it was their duty to inform passengers if they could not fulfil certain requirements and asked him to hand me the fruit. 
Our return flight was more disastrous. We queued up at the check-in desk assigned for premium economy. The line wasn’t moving as someone paying for extra luggage was there and was holding it up. I asked an assistant if one of the economy desks could take us instead to which they replied no, as they would in Iberia. Since I wasn’t having any of it, as soon as a desk freed up, I went to it. The person didn’t even bother apologising or anything and he was like you should have gone to the business queue to which I informed him I did ask and was told to go the premium economy queue. 
Once we are past security and immigration, we realise that my husband’s ticket is not his but another person’s! So much for safety and security with Iberia. We freaked out of course, went to security where they told us we should wait for the people at the gate to arrive. We do so and they reissue the now correct ticket. 
On the flight, my vegan meal contains non-vegan cheese in the salad. When the snack arrives, I am given a little container with some salad, ham and chicken!!!!!! That doesn’t even qualify as vegetarian! Maybe only paleo at best!
And then when breakfast arrives, I am given a croissant with lettuce an cheese, again!!!! And croissants are known for their huge amount of dairy butter!

Just one nightmare after another,Miami,Madrid,International,"It's just that nothing works.  The staff and attendents are all very kind -- but so what?  The web page doesn't work.  You can buy tickets six months before your flight, and then a month before take off it turns out they never gave you the seats you paid for.  I waited until the day before the flight, then spend two or three hours downloading and printing out our boarding passes, only to find out after waiting on a one-hour line that they didn't scan on the scanner.  So we all had to go back and wait on the check in line.  If you fly another airline, you will notice that all the seats are newer and better; all the equipment is updated and works.  If you want to call Iberia customer service, you can plan on taking the day off work, because you will wait a long time to get a person.

Don’t fly Iberia,Madrid,Quito,International,"My first time flying with Iberia and I really would not recommend it to anyone.

We were not the only ones to comment on this at the end of the flight. 
I had a gluten free meal which was a dollop of mashed potato and an overcooked piece of beef. Yuk.

Worst booking system and customer service of any airline I’ve ever used,London,Madrid,Europe,"Iberia’s booking system and customer service are easily the worst I have ever encountered, and I fly at least once a month.

I tried booking a flight from London to Madrid over the Christmas break. After a slow and clunky online booking process, I was sent my reservation and given 24 hrs to confirm it. However, there was a problem. The return date was wrong by an entire year.

After checking that I hadn’t made a mistake in the booking, I called them up and was told that due to a fault with their IT systems, plenty of passengers on that day had experienced the same problem. I was re-sent a flight reservation with the right date and told them to confirm it there and then over the phone. I was reassured it was all taken care of.

Several days later, I noticed that the price of my tickets had been refunded. I called customer service and told that (despite my previous confirmation over the phone) my reservation had expired and been cancelled. They made no apology for this. I was then told that I would need to rebook again from scratch but due to (another) problem with their systems, I wouldn’t be able to do that in the afternoon. I then asked to be put through to their complaints department. I was told me they didn’t have one at which point the customer service adviser hung up on me.

I ended up having to book through another airline, at a higher price on different dates.

I honestly do not know how Iberia is still in business. They have reached a point where they are worse than their low-cost competitors by every measure. They also give a bad name to their OneWorld partners by association. I’m never using them again.if I can avoid them, for business or leisure.",October 2019,"November 2, 2019",1.0,,,,1.0,1.0,,,
Barcelona airport is a joke that went from bad to worse.,Barcelona,Boston,International,"Barcelona-Boston was the last leg of a round trip to Italy with layovers in Madrid (outbound) and Barcelona (return).  We were given no chance to select seats, or check in early, even at extra cost, for the Barcelona-Boston flight. 

The outbound journey was ok, except that Iberia doesn't accept Known Traveler Numbers, so my husband and I had to go through the regular security process.  We had an offer to upgrade to business class, which we took, and that was comfortable.  The food was decent if not terrific. 

Things went sharply downhill on our return to Boston.  The flight back was operated by two Iberia affiliates (subsidiaries?): Vueling from Florence to Barcelona and Level from Barcelona to Boston.   We were not allowed to check in online for the Barcelona-Boston flight, and the counter agent in Florence said we couldn't choose our seats till we got to Barcelona, and our pre-assigned seats might not even be together.   

On arrival in Barcelona, we were told our flight to Boston would leave from Area D.  We followed the signs to Area D, but they ended abruptly at an undesignated point,  with no indication of how to continue to Area D.  After wandering around for a while we finally found an information desk, and were told we needed to go up an escalator and through passport control. We should have been given this information without having to hunt for it.  On arrival in area D we went immediately to the gate, and asked about our seats.  There were no restaurants or amenities in that area, so we couldn't even get a snack.  We asked about an upgrade, but none was available. Fortunately at least our seats were together.  Meanwhile, a long line was forming for boarding. While at the counter we were approached by a security officer and taken away for a random security check.  By the time that was over, the boarding line was about 200 people long, and we were at the end of it.  When we finally reached the checkpoint we saw that the actual gate was three flights down, and the escalator was broken.  We had a rolling carry-on and a garment bag, and the idea of dragging them down three flights of stairs was daunting. (we saw that several people were made to check their carry-ons).   A very kind official offered to take us, and one other woman, down in an elevator.  We got out at the bottom, and the kind official left us there. We found ourselves on the wrong side of a glass wall, with the boarding passengers going down the stairs on the other side.  The emergency door was locked.  After pounding on the glass for a while, a kind gentleman went back up to find someone to help; at that point we were getting worried about missing the plane.  While that was happening, my husband studied the door latch and saw that it would, in fact, open.  The notice on the door read: Lift Tab, Press Button (or something to that effect).  The door did open and we went through, by which time the kind gentleman had returned with an official to help let us through.  His main concern was not that we had been dumped in the wrong area, but that the door had opened at all, since it was supposed to be securely locked to all except official personnel.  Two or three people bustled about to make sure it was re-locked.

We passengers were shepherded onto a bus, and kept there for at least 15-20 minutes before setting off to find the airplane.  We drove around in seemingly endless circles to the farthest possible point in the airport (another several minutes) before finally approaching the aircraft.  Our seats were together, in a row with no window, and very basic, no pillow or blanket, and no menu, except for one that listed food items for payment.  Because our reservation specified ""meals included,"" we asked the attendant, who checked a list and said yes, we would receive meals.   Apparently only those on the list were to be fed.  I was appalled to think that on an eight-hour+ flight, some passengers would have to pay (through the nose) for their meals.  The food was about the worst I've ever had on a plane, served in cardboard boxes and all but inedible.  I couldn't even eat the dessert.  
The entertainment was meager: only four or five movies were offered, and very few TV programs.  
On the positive side, all the personnel, including the security officers, were very courteous and nice,  the seats were marginally more comfortable than the worst (Latam) I've experienced, and we got to Boston on time.  Found our bags easily at baggage claim.

No welcome drink was offered.

Seat 2A and 2C were a bad choice this time, since also here on Iberia the overhead bins of row 1+2 left, and 1 right were occupied special compartments for crew belongings, newspapers and staff. Again we had to find space to allocate out hand luggage further in the back, which makes it difficult to get hands on against the flow during disembarking later on arrival.

Overall a solid Business Class hard product on a Schengen mid-haul flight,Düsseldorf,Madrid,Europe,"Early morning in Duesseldorf:
After some minor tech issues at Iberia check-in (they appologized for being unable to read QR-Code on Mobile devices that day), and huge queues at security even at Fast Lane (blame it to the Airport rather than to Iberia), it took almost 1 hr to finally make it inside the transit area.

Short visit for refreshing and a quick coffee at Hugo-Junkers-Lounge at T2 Departure Level 2. It's meanwhile like coming home a bit to this Business Lounge, which is used by Oneworld as well as Skyteam, and successfully received a major renovation back in early 2018, I like the result.
Hugo-Junkers-Lounge is probably nothing to write home about Airport Lounges, but is spotless clean, provides  shower facilities, and still offers some nice apron views next to a small and basic but decent food  & bevs selection.

This first leg of our DUS-MAD-ACE trip was operated by Iberia, while the 2nd leg from MAD to ACE was operated by their notorious LCC *Iberia Express*.

Boarding in DUS was on time. 

What did I liked?
# overall friendly and attentive crew
# pillow and blanket provided on a 2h40 mid-haul flight
# wet cleaning towel on the breakfast tray
# Menu, decent meal, cotton napkin
# 20 min before landing anouncement with gate numbers of of a couple of connecting flights, esp. appreciated when our flight was delayed by round 20 min + loooong taxiways in MAD until docking, and I had a short connection - no time to dawdle, shop or see the lounge.

Things I didn't liked too much:
# no welcome drink, and the first drink offered at all was during the breakfast service 1 hr after take-off
# their coffee tasted awful
# cabin announcements were pretty much inarticulately, could barely understand what they have to mumble neither in English nor Spanish

So they advised us to go to barcelona iberia help desk. Who also saw the mistake but advise us to  make claim online. After 3 months, Iberia keeps on telling us that since we bought the ticket with Vueling we should be refunded by Vueling. Then vice versa. The iberia customer service in the phone can actually see that our money is with iberia and i was wrongfully charged.

I don't need the pod that fully reclines into a bed, but I do need a seat that has basic comfort and enough recline. The seats are lacking padding, therefore really uncomfortable.

Worst airline ever,Boston,Barcelona,International,"My wife and I looked at each with a mix of horror and disgust.   We had just handed our boarding passes and passports to the ticket agent at Iberian Airlines.
“When are you leaving Spain?” she asked.
“On the 18th”, J replied.
“Show me proof,” she demanded.
“There’s our boarding passes and we are returning on your airlines.  Aren’t we in your system?”
“No, the ticket agent said, that’s why I’m asking.” We suspected this could be true, since their website is fairly useless, so  J dug through her pile of papers and eventually found a print out of the itinerary.  This satisfied her temporarily but they were not done with us yet. 
After they checked our suitcases ($55 each) and sent them down the chute, they asked if we any electronics in them.  J had a laptop in hers, so they told us to wait for 5 minutes while they retrieved the suitcase.  Half an hour later they returned with the suitcase so she could remove the laptop. (This policy was not posted anywhere).
While we were waiting at the counter for the suitcase to be retrieved, the ticket agent asked the next guy in line for proof he was returning to the US.  Except that he had no return ticket to the US: he was proceeding to other destinations after Barcelona. He begged and pleaded; he was almost in tears but she would not let him use a ticket her airline had obviously sold to him.  Repeatedly he asked why and her answer was always the same - company requirement.
We finally got on board, an hour late, which we learned was because the jet way got stuck. The tail of the plane said “Level” as well as the on board graphics.  The same kind of dour attitude prevailed as at the ticket counter.  We have been on many international trips the past few years - British Airways, Lufthansa, Alaska Air, Delta and United. On all of these international flights you usually get a blanket or earbuds and maybe a snack. On Iberia you got nothing unless you were willing to pay for it-it was as bad as US domestic flights.  Nothing was free, not even water.  Leg room was ridiculous. I am on 5' 10"" and had bruises on my knees from the seat in front. The trip back from Spain was almost as bad. The website is totally useless for check in and baggage drop  took forever as numerous people had to unpack their bags, presumably because they had electronics in them.

Shockingly poor,San Jose,London,International,"We travelled economy from Costa Rica to Madrid and then Madrid to Heathrow. 

1. From Costa Rica

The seats and legroom were the same for long haul and short haul. We couldn’t straighten our legs and as soon as the person in front reclined their seat, that was it, game over. 

The flight took just under 11 hours. A few hours in we were served (although ‘chucked’ would be a more apt description of the delivery) a pitiful tray. On it was a stone cold bread bun, unsealed, covered in liquid and other bits of food. Next to that was some sort of lukewarm rubber pasta, no idea what it was supposed to be but I couldn’t get a knife through it so couldn’t eat it. There were no other options. So I ended up eating 3 tiny crackers and that was it. 

No water or juice or anything came around and so we had to go find someone to request some water. You’d think I’d asked for a bar of gold the way the cabin crew reacted and reluctantly handed over a cup of water. 

Nothing at all, no snacks or liquids, came around for the next 8 hours. Then we were served ‘breakfast’. This consisted of a wet bread roll wrapped in cling film containing some sort of meat and cheese. As I had requested vegetarian I asked for an alternative and was told this wouldn’t be possible. So I was left with a fruit pot the size of an espresso shot and a tiny chocolate bar. 

Breakfast at least came with coffee and juice, which was spilled over my partner. 

So, for an 11 hour flight I had 3 crackers, 3 slices of kiwi and a chocolate bar. 

There was also zero chance of sleeping due to the lack of space.

2. From Madrid 

Our electronic ticket and online stated boarding would commence at 13:05 and gate closing time was 13:25. At 12:55 we reached the gate to find it closed. There were quite a few of us so we were let through. 

We reached the plane where we were told my luggage (small hand luggage) would have to be checked in as there was no room left. I explained that I had a very tight schedule with a train to catch afterward but this made no difference. 

We made our way to our seats to find many spaces in the overhead lockers and the one above our seats had 3 coats in it (not ours). The one opposite had small handbags, shopping etc in. I asked a member of the cabin crew why I had to check my case in when there was so much space and she replied ‘well there are other passengers getting on’.

 We then watched as several other passengers got on with large cases and loaded them into the empty spaces, along with coats, shopping, laptops etc despite sitting in seats far away from the overhead lockers located above and opposite our seats. It was baffling.

Of course we missed our train due to having to wait for the checked in case which took 30 mins.

Lost Baggage Nightmare!,Tenerife,Miami,International,"Upon returning to Florida from our two weeks vacation, we were without our luggage at the carisol.

We found a representative who was the least helpful person I've met in quite some time.  We landed at 8:00 pm Friday 10/11.  It took an hour for this man to assist us with nothing more than a clipboard, some photocopied forms and carbon paper!  He had no computer and hand wrote the claim then handed us a copy assuring us we would receive a text message by morning with an update.

The following morning there was no word so I called.  That was a disaster.  After about 10 minutes I finally was able to talk to a ""human"" who although he had no information assured me they were working on returning the bags and I would receive a text  by the end of the day.

At 8:00 pm still no text message or bags, so I called again.  Again 10 minutes before an actual person came on and he told me he believed our bags were in Miami but he could not verify that, but promised me I would recieve a text update shortly.

Sunday morning there were still no bags or even a text message.  So I called again and after 10 minuts I was speaking with the most horrible person I've ever spoken to in my life, ""Maria.""  Maria told me there was no word on my bags at all, she could not even tell me if they had left Tenerife, if the were in Madrid or if they had made it to Miami.   She told me my questions were a waste of her time and that I simply needed to ""sit and wait"" for an update.  She refused to let me speak to a Supervisor or even another representative.  She then told me she had already wasted 12 minutes on the phone with me and then hung up on me!

I was so frustrated and not sure what to do next.  I simply had no desire to be abused by the horrific staff so I "" sat and waited.""

Finally late on Monday, three days after landing, I heard our ring and saw a driver with our bags.  

Three full days, not one single text message or e-mail from Iberia.  I find it hard to believe with the technology available today, not one person could give me an accurate update.  They were rude and nasty and I will NEVER fly Iberia again!!",October 2019,"October 15, 2019",1.0,,,,,,,,

Our flight was scheduled for 3pm, so, arriving like normal to the airport, 2 hours before, was normal. At 3pm when the plane began to load and get ready for departure all seemed OK, and, as we taxied out to the runway, we stopped, and then the pilot came on and said the their was a problem with the engine and we had to debark the plane, so we did. They bussed us back to the terminal, after advising everyone that the plane needed a part and that there would be a delay in leaving. Well, thats when the nightmare started 4pm, 5pm, 6pm, and nothing, we were all waiting in the terminal for news of our flight. Folks started to get hungry and began complaining to the attendant at the Iberia desk, and after about an hour and a half, they finally gave each pasanger a 6 euro voucher for something to eat and drink, we were all laughing, I mean really Iberia?????? Anyway, at 9:30pm that evening we were informored that the flight was cancelled. We then had to wait for a bus to come and pick us up and take us back to Dubrovnink where we had to spend the night. By the time we got checked in and to our room, it was 11:30 at night, oh, and by the way, we had to be up at 4am the next morning as the flight to Madrid was leaving at 7am, Upon arriving to the airport and repeating the check in again, we were all informed that the flight was delayed. At 8am we began boarding and returned to Madrid, one day late. Iberia, you know by law if a flight is cancelled, like the one mentioned in this review, you have the obliagtion to send another flight to pick up your passengers, you did not.

In four trips through the Madrid airport to make connections from and to the US, I would guess we have spent close to three hours walking and riding a distance of probably 4 km - seriously.  The circulation pattern or gate locations or both area a joke.  This is a beautiful airport but I don't need an aerobic experience after flying all night!

The Iberia crew were initially vaguely attentive but that wore off pretty quickly (by the safety brief, more or less). Sadly, their manner of service matched the indifferent attention levels and at times, it seemed like we passengers were nothing but a nuisance, and it would be better if they could just be done with us as quickly as possible so they could retreat to the galley.

I was assigned a seat in the last row of the cabin near the flight attendant's galley which means they walked into my shoulder each time they went passed me due to the narrow seats.
The seats were small and uncomfortable, leg/foot space was minimal. No meal. Ignored by attendants. no option to purchase food or beverage. Eventually the attendants disappeared... probably for a nap.

My return flight from Barcelona: Assigned 26L which was in the last row before the bathrooms. The seat didn't recline so when the person in front of me reclined their seat it was 10 inches from my face for 7 hours. The seat in front of mine was also hitting my knees. It would have been a good seat for a young child. I did, however, get a meal on this flight... The flight crew seemed to be in a better mood, especially after they woke up from their nap.

I'm not sure if I got a terrible seat assignment because I booked on Travelocity or not. I've used Travelocity in the past and never had this problem. Other seats seemed to be more spacious. I had seat envy.

Delayed suitcase,Tenerife,Menorca,Domestic,"When searching for a flight from Tenerife to Menorca, I realized that a stop over in Madrid or Barcelona is inevitable.
When changing flight as part of the itinerary, I often arrive at the final airport finding that my suitcase has been left behind somewhere.
It is extremely inconvenient and the airlines do not seem to acknowledge just how inconvenient and uncomfortable this situation is for any person travelling.
When reporting a case missing, the employees at the airport office just shrug their shoulders and tell that such things can happen.
With modern technology and tags on each and every suitcase I am surprised the system still fails.
And now the airlines are even beginning to encourage passengers to place their handluggage together with the suitcases. All trolleys designed especially to fit the required size as hand luggage should go down in the luggage department.
I see huge rygsacks and oversized softer bags accepted as cabin luggage taking up so much place in overhead compartment as well as under the seat storage place. Correct sized handluggage trolleys are rejected.
I am very happy that my little trolley after much debating, finally were allowed in the passenger cabin.
Thank you so much. If not I would have been leaving the airport with all my belongings lost.

The service was HORRIBLE the flight attendants were very rude not accommodating and act as if they could not speak English.

When they gave me the free food you were only allowed that tray and one drink you could not come back to get another soft drink.  I’ve never heard of such it was devastating. When I asked the passenger sitting next to me why didn’t he receive food he told me he bought a budget ticket so he had to pay for his food.

Otherwise fine but improve integration with BA,Casablanca,New York City,International,I have taken Iberia on multiple occasions. Their service is fine. I did find them to be on time and prompt. This time I bought the tix from British Airways taking Iberia on return. I found the whole experience problematic. For my return journey I wanted meals and seat selection and couldn't do this online. I had to get on the phone multiple times and discover different booking codes. I also found out that since I bought the ticket from British Airways I could not make certain changes with request to luggage on phone even if I was able to pay for it.

"Confusing website, average flight.",Birmingham,Madrid,Europe,"Wee booked a return trip to Madrid with Iberia, Spain’s main airline.

They were reasonably priced, there’s not a lot of choice when flying to Madrid from anywhere north of London!

The website is extremely confusing to use at times. Adding bags etc at the end, disrupting the prices. Making changes, the website changes from English to Spanish constantly! And when you switch back to English from Spanish, it takes you back to he home screen...frustrating to say the least!

Two changes were made to the outbound flight, and one to the return. We only knew of these changes as we regularly check our emails. If you’re a person who doesn’t...be warned! No other correspondence was made by Iberia (text or phone call, for example). This also affected our parking times which had to then be changed.

At Birmingham airport, check in was quite hectic. Only a couple of staff checking in, and machines to print boarding passes and bag tags. This is the same at Madrid airport, expect a totally electronic check in with plenty of people queuing and looking confused. The boarding passes would also not scan on the machines to allow entry to security checking area....join another long queue!

The planes are not that modern, and quite tatty.
Both flights were delayed, this was on top of the already changed flight times we had originally purchased.

"Good flight, horrible customer service",San Francisco,Barcelona,International,"Had a month long trip to Europe and used Ibera/level.  The online check in is horrible, i had to input my info 3 different times, tried upgrading seats and luggage but the website didnt allow it.  When I used the service at the counter it was more expensive.   I asked about the error and the counter service representative gave me a number to call for the next  check of in problem.   

Of course, the next check in problem came when we were flying home.  It was the same issue with the data entry and then the error getting our seats upgraded.  I called the number given to me by the representative and some lady goes on a 7 minute rant without pause berating about a 24 hour cut off and being a basic customer.  When I asked to get a word in to ask a question she put me on hold, likely to never answer again.  

I  called back and talked to a guy that was actually willing to answer questions without a problem.   I would only recommend this airline for the savings of money if you only have carry on luggage and short legs.  

I doubt it would ever happen but if anyone wants to call me from Iberia, feel free.  You have likely lost any future bookings from this customer.

"Overbooking from Havana, Cuba",Havana,Rome,International,"Such a tacky Company!! When my husband, my son and I arrived at Havana airport, to go back home, they told us that the business class was full,  even we bought the tickets months earlier and was just the return flight,  two of us had to go in economic. After useless complaints, my husband and my son got the economic class. I flew business class and I don't have a good memory not only for the bad experience, in fact  the seat was very dirt (I have to admit the seat was dirt also in the outbound flight) and the food was very poor and from one bathroom flowed a terrible smell.  The cabin doors was opened during the night and one pilot went to talk with a woman in business. What kind of security measures! I cannot bring in the airplane a shampoo but they can do everything the want. The company refunded us the class difference but, if I buy a business class ticket, it means that I want to fly business or not?   I read that overbooking is forbidden even illicit, why they don't pay any fine and all the discomfort goes on passenger, and how is possible an overbooking on a return flight from Havana in business? Should be noted that, when we where at the check in in Havana, the employ told us that there were no other flight or solutions for the following days and if we wouldn't have accepted the economic class we had been stuck in Havana at our expenses, what a kind way to put the client at comfort!!! Previously I  flew Iberia in business to Miami and everything was clean and comfortable, so  the general feeling is that  the flight to Havana is a kind of ""we don't care about because is not a cool and rich destination and we are one of the few companies that flies there"" minimum effort and maximum gain.",January 2019,"September 29, 2019",1.0,,,,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,
British Airways/Iberia Airlines,London,Madrid,Europe,"I booked a return flights for 2 to Madrid on British Airways. The flight was with Iberia who are one of the airlines BA use. My friend asked me to book a case after we booked for hand luggage but it was nigh on impossible to get through to BA and when I eventually got through I was told they couldn’t help and I was to ring Iberia.  I spoke to a young man who said I could not book online. At one point I’m sure he said ‘it’s dangerous’. What!!!   Rang again and spoke to a woman who said she could not do it as there are no Iberia desks at Heathrow.  Finally spoke to someone at BA who explained why I could not book a case online.  It took him 30 minutes explaining and extolling the virtues of BA and how much more I could take in hand luggage than other airlines allowed.  He then said the flights were very cheap but I told him as I could not check in a case online which would have been £20.00 compared to £40.00 each way at the airport, it would add another £80 to the flights, so it would not be so cheap. 
I tried checking in online 24 hours before as instructed on the app, but it did not recognise the booking. My friend tried the next day and we still couldn’t check in.  We arrived at Heathrow and tried booking in at the relevant machines and it still would not accept the booking.  We were then diverted to the Iberia check in, the ones we were told they did not have at Heathrow.  We explained to a young man what had happened and he said the website wasn't working properly and Iberia had been told about this numerous times over the past year.  Two people who were in earshot said they had booked direct with Iberia and they could not check in. So I don’t think it’s because we booked through BA.  We were then told that our cases would be put in the hold as the plane was full because of BA strikes 2-3 days before.  I wasn’t happy as I could not check a case in online now I’m being told my case should go in the hold, albeit free of charge. When we got on the plane there was plenty of room for our cases.
When we landed we were taken by shuttle buses to arrivals, or so we thought. We were actually dropped of at departures. People were walking down the stairs as we were all going up.  When we asked anyone for help we were pointed in a general direction. My friend and I, together with 2 men who were also on our flight, walked around for an hour. We finally found the luggage carousel we needed at the furtherest point.
On our return, we arrived 2hrs 30mins before our flight. We went to the check in machines. This time it recognised our booking, great or so we thought. We booked our seats next to each other, there were plenty available, probably because no one could check in online.  We pushed the button to get our boarding passes only to see a message saying it did not recognise the booking, yet it had all our information.   We asked a lady working for Iberia but she just told us to use the machine that we told her didn’t work for us and then I spoke to a man who explained that the system gets overloaded in summer.  This is September not July/August.  Then he said maybe it wanted more information.  What information, my blood group!!!  We arrived at the relevant desk after queuing for nearly an hour and explained that we couldn’t check in at the machines. We obviously didn’t look very happy.  She gave us our boarding passes and we said thank you and walked away but I turned around and caught the young lady pulling a face at her colleague.  She should have waited till we were out of sight. She looked suitably embarrassed. On route to the terminal my friend gave me my boarding pass, she was in seat 14E and I was in 51E. The young lady never said anything about the seating or gave us any indication that one of us was at the front of the plane and one at the back.   Madrid Airport is awful to get around, even a couple from Madrid agreed with us on that point.  I think we could have walked to London quicker.  The flights were fine but both airlines’s customer service was appalling.  My friend flies with BA all the time but it was my first time with them and Iberia.   Sadly it will be my last.

The worst customer service ever !,New York City,Madrid,International,"Our flight departed JFK 30 minutes late causing us to miss our connecting flight to Granada. Due to thousands of people moving through the airport on the Saturday morning of September 7th, and trying to clear immigration, it took us 90 minutes to make it from our arrival gate to the departing flight gate. 
Iberia's customer service woman proceeded to tell us that the next and only flight to Granada was full and that she would not refund of ticket price as we should have made the flight. She said that other passengers traveling in economy made the flight so we should have as well ! We told her that we did not stop on our way to the flight's gate and that if any passengers did make the flight they must have cut lines. Additionally, she told us that she did not know if our luggage made the flight and that we should go to the baggage claim area to ""look around"" for our bags. Her arrogance was incredible, frankly speaking, she should be fired for this.
After being delayed with Iberia's nonsense for over 2 hours and in order to make it to Granada, we had to rent a car and drive 5 hours, still not knowing where our luggage was as Iberia's Customer service could not trace it.
Our luggage was located and delivered to our hotel that evening at 9:30pm.
Iberia's arrogant customer's service, their refusal to refund our ticker cost to Granada and their disorganized attempt to locate our luggage is beyond the pale.

"Cancellations are bad, but the customer service was ABYSMAL",Tenerife,London,Europe,"Iberia offers a useful early AM departure from Tenerife that lets flyers make transatlantic midday connections, so there I was at 2:45 AM at TCS, heading out. The Iberia Express flight from TCS to Madrid was fine, though the boarding was badly handled. Brief, mumbled introductions only in Castilian, indicating boarding by groups, then a second burst of mumbling that actually they'd board people without hand luggage first. No English, changes, and lots of standing in the gangway.

But that was just the appetizer. For my second leg to Heathrow, I got a cheery gate number e-mail at 7:15 AM that neglected to mention that the flight had officially been cancelled at 6:45. Neither did the boarding announcement board at Madrid airport. The plane was there at the gate... but no gate staff. Then, 15 minute before boarding, the monitors suddenly showed 'cancelled'. I used the app to find that I had been rerouted to London via Munich (no e-mail). Of course, I didn't have a boarding pass to Munich or for Munich-London, and there was still no one at the gate. So about 90 people rushed to the nearest Iberia service desk... where 2 people VERY slowly started handing out new boarding passes. Since my Munich boarding was in 15 minutes, I just went to the gate, and the one useful Iberia staffer printed my itinerary to Munich and said I could board with that. 

So off to Munich (with no boarding pass and no gate information on the connecting BA flight to London). I asked at the gate at deplaning how to get to my connecting gate... what a mistake! A rude, bored, and useless young lady announced she was only responsible for Iberia (I was an Iberia passenger just off an Iberia flight!), and ignored me. Wow!

I did find my gate, and the BA staff for that flight were actually competent and professional... what a change!

Naturally, the re-routing (no reason was every given for the cancellation) meant I missed my connection in London, meaning the cost of hotel room and a change fee on that flight. I've sent off my request for compensation to Iberia, but fully expect them to deny it for some bogus reason, or for no reason at all (like the no reason they gave for cancelling my connection in the first place).

We were directed to customer service and rebooked on a plane that left four hours later.  We asked about our luggage and were assured that it would be on the same later plane.  As you can guess, when we got to Bilbao - no luggage as it was still in Madrid.  It was delivered to our hotel the next day in the afternoon.  The leg room on the plane was very cramped and the seat was hard.  Our flights were short, thankfully, so it did not cause too much discomfort.  
I am fairly sure that I am entitled to some compensation for this delay of more than four hours under laws governing EEU flights.  I tried to file a complaint with them online.  While I had no trouble changing the language to English when I was purchasing a ticket, their website seems to keep defaulting back to Spanish when you are trying to contact them about a customer service issue.  I also flew two other low cost airlines on my trip - Vueling and Easyjet.  I found both of these airlines to be better experiences.  I would not book Iberia again if there were other options.",August 2019,"September 20, 2019",1.0,2.0,2.0,,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,
Not great,Malaga,Madrid,Domestic,"We were forced to use this company as out original flight had been cancelled. When we boarded the plane, the pilot left the gate, stopped the plane and came out of the cockpit, shouted at a man in the first row, then went back in the cockpit and slammed the door. As the plane was predominantly Spanish I had to call a male member of cabin crew who informed us that the man in the front seat had refused to off his earphones for the safety briefing and so they were calling for the police and we had to wait for him to be offloaded. not a problem EXCEPT the lady next to me had been asleep with her ear pods in and so had a couple of others....it was obvious with the one chappie as his head was lolled forward. Surely the rules should apply for everyone. A lot of people were on connecting flights (as were we) and the hold up was almost an hour.

Secondly, sadly for us we were in row 3 (never fly row 3) the close a very short curtain to separate you from the 'premium' 2 rows in front. These small curtains are no more than 10-12"" in front of your face wafting about. It causes the feeling of claustrophobia. Would make eating difficult and is the closest thing I could imagine to being in a coffin - I really hated it and thanked god it was only a short flight. There was also a bellowing one in the aisle which totally enclosed you. I would strongly suggest that a member of Iberia actually fly with these curtains closed.",September 2019,"September 20, 2019",3.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0

By the time we got to the front we were told it in too late to check in and had to go to a different line. After going to a DIFFERENT line and finally getting checked in, we had to cut through multiple lines (security, passport check) and sprint to our plane and got there within 2 minutes of closing the doors.

Iberia is equal bad as Ryan Air,Lisbon,Venice,Europe,"I really hate flight companies that force people to check in their hand luggage like for example Iberia. 

If I travel with hand luggage it’s because i want the freedom to have control over my things. 
They should have a rutin for it, like for offer some compensation for the people that can consider to help out. 
I'm traveling a lot with Luft Hansa and they never have problem with this. 
Even when they are full and on business days when most of the passengers don't check in and all have hand luggage. 
Of course you need to use the space under the seat but it's never a problem. I will take a second thought next time i'm flying to avoid Iberia if they don't create a better rutin for this. The output for the passengers is bad logistics and a high stress factor that gives you a bad and terrible experience.

Lost Luggage NIGHTMARE,San Francisco,Barcelona,International,"If you’re planning a trip to Spain any time soon (or any other country where Iberia operates), DO NOT fly Iberia. Please avoid Iberia at all costs. I recently flew Iberia and the airline lost my luggage—and still have not found it. It’s been eight weeks, and Iberia has provided NO consistent information as to its whereabouts. Every time I call their lost luggage hotline, an Iberia employee tells me something different. I’ve created an in-depth document tracking the situation, but below is a quick rundown of my nightmare interaction with Iberia:

Number of calls I made to the lost luggage department: 23
Number of visits I made to the Iberia’s lost luggage desk at an airport (in BCN, MAD, SFO): 9
Number of times I was told my bag would be delivered within 24 hours: 6
Number of times an Iberia employee hung up on me while I was trying to get information: 5
Number of times an Iberia employee blamed another employee for not correctly searching for my suitcase: 3
Number of times an Iberia manager told me “it’s August and everyone is on vacation, so it might be a while before your luggage is found”: 1
The estimated amount of clothing, makeup, shoes, accessories, skincare products, etc. in the lost suitcase: $15K

I’ve filed a claim and have not heard from Iberia’s compensation department. Since Iberia is doing NOTHING to resolve my situation and their system is broken, I’m sharing my story on social media. Please forward, so people know NOT TO fly Iberia.",July 2019,"September 18, 2019",1.0,,,,1.0,1.0,,1.0,

Regional flight,Alicante,Tenerife,Domestic,"Good service and a quite novel experience in this compact jet aircraft which was smaller than usual, with about 22 rows of 4 seats (2 pairs in each row). Limited storage space on board, so they out your small suitcases in the storage area under the aircraft before boarding. 

Luckily, there are sometimes one or two seats to spare if you don't want to have to pay for your place to stop them deliberately separating you during the online check-in!

Friendly hostesses and cabin crew who made a point of inviting a youngster to see the cockpit for about ten minutes. You don't usually see that on RyanAir Airbuses.

In-flight announcements by cabin crew and the pilot (not sure whether the captain or the first officer) much easier to understand in Spanish than the occasionally heavily accented English they used (usual examples, saying 'can' instead of ""can't"", ""fly""  (= mosca) instead of 'flight (=vuelo), etc. 

While one realises that English is the international language of aviation, one is – nonetheless – somehow left with the amusing supposition that they must look through the passenger manifest surnames to ""confirm"" their ideas about whether there's anyone on board who looks British and, supposedly, therefore (!) won't be able to understand or speak Spanish. ¡Sin embargo, en la realidad no es así!",August 2019,"September 16, 2019",4.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0

However, there was no communication from crew about ordering and when I realized that the so called online order service was broken, I called the attendant to order many times.

An airline that doesn't give a damn about its passengers,Granada,Madrid,Domestic,"We flew from Madrid to Seville and then returned from Granada to Madrid. Where to begin....My wife requires a wheelchair when she has to walk extreme distances. In case you are not aware of it, the Madrid Airport is Gigantic. Unlike other airlines, the place where you go to get your wheelchair service is very difficult to find and there is no signage pointing you in the right direction. When we finally got there ( about 1/4 mile walk) there was a line to check in for your reserved wheelchair. A LINE for people who need a wheelchair - what's wrong with that picture! One man is very slowly signing in each person and the line is quite a wait - people who need wheelchairs are STANDING ON A SLOW AND LONG LINE!!!  On the return we get off the plane and search for our reserved wheelchair but it is no where in sight. We enter the terminal where we are told that we are not eligible for a wheelchair because we managed to get off the plane by ourselves. The footnote to that is when you reserve a wheelchair on line they ask you to specify if you need help onto the plane or if you only need it to travel long distances at the airport. We told them up front we only needed it for the distances but now they want to penalize us because we got off the plane without it!!???!!! Ultimately the man in charge got us a wheelchair but made it clear he was doing us a favor. On top of that, I had paid for upgraded seats but when they checked us in they gave us other seats and I didn't notice. Turns out NO ONE but the check in counter can alter that.???  No one????  On other airlines, like Delta, it could have been handled by the counter at the gate but not with Iberia. CONCLUSION - The management of Iberia really doesn't have any concern for its passengers.

"A nightmare, una pesadilla",Madrid,Brussels,Europe,"Outbound flight was with SN Brussels Airlines so I could compare both services.
Boith airlines have the usual 'skynnyas paper torture seats' which are uncomfortable to sit in let alone sleep (too short, hard as a slab of concrete). However, legroom a tad better at SN, cramped at Iberia with my legs against the front seat (I'm 1m78). Do not try to put one leg on the corridor, it will inevitably collide with the bulldozer Iberia ladies roaming the plane.
Catering: minimal at SN (a miserable little warp + one drink dspite a flex ticket costing an arm and a leg), non existent at Iberia, even a glass of water, unless you pay.
Luggage: both annnoying, carry-ons requested to go onthe hold after a few passengers in. At Iberia I must note I had to put a piece on hold (a brought back a bottle of precious Venezuelan rhum), despte what was mentioned on the ticket, carried for free.
Plane: nice clean A319 at SN, but the larger A321 of Iberia was worn (reading spot not workig, erratic USB charging port), A/C not very good (too hot with some intermittent icy air). 
Staff not very friendly, they looked as unhappy as the passengers, even the SN hostesses are friendlier.
Overall experience: Iberia experience not much different than a vulgar low cost à la Ryanair. 
One special annoyance are the stridend/endless/repetitive/uninteresting announcements of the Spanish ladies blasted on your ears at full volume for safety (OK, OK, I can understand), food (paying), Wifi (paying), tax free boutique (you guessed), take-off, we are arriving, blabla from the flight deck, wherever blabla, all in  languages...So do not even try to sleep on your torture tiny chair.

I want to be brief but..,Madrid,Los Angeles,International,"The best thing about Iberia is that they offer a non-stop flights between Madrid and Los Angeles.  After that things go downhill.  We purchased the basic economy fare because of the low price.  In retrospect, I would spend more and select my seat at time of booking.  With Iberia, you cannot select your economy seat until 24 hours in advance.  Two years ago when we flew Iberia to Madrid, we ended up with great seats when we checked-in online 24 hours in advance.  This year, we had good luck doing that with our seats from LAX to Madrid, but it was a nightmare on the way home.  Also, if you plan on checking luggage, I would NOT pay to check it in advance.  When we checked in for our flight in L.A., we were not charged a penny for  checked bags (despite what it said on the website), however, when we checked in for our return flight, we were charged for the bags.  Maybe we were lucky in L.A., or maybe Iberia is inconsistent in their checked bag policy.  I always think it's worth taking a shot at the counter because a little friendly banter can go a long way in terms of avoiding charges.

Coming home, we tried dozens and dozens of times to check-in online but we could not do it.  Three tickets had been purchased together on one credit card, so check-in required all three of us to check-in at once.  Unfortunately, although all the information for all three travelers was showing and was correct, we were caught in a glitch that could not be corrected.  For one traveler, we kept receiving an error message asking us to enter the country of issuance of his passport, despite the fact that the country of issuance was filled out.  No matter how many times we entered ""USA"" (something that had been entered when we purchased the tickets), none of us could check in because the site would not accept the information.  I even had a representative from Expedia contact the airline.  Per the first Iberia agent, and her supervisor (allegedly), they could see that ""USA"" was in the system but they could not override it. As a result, none of us could check-in in advance.  As a result, when we checked-in at the airport, two of us ended up with center seats for the flight, despite the supervisor taking our requests for two aisle and one window seat.   That was not the only problem with Iberia's website, which needs to be re-done in its entirety.   It is an absolute nightmare, as you will learn if you book a flight on Iberia for more than one person.

As for the flight itself, even in the middle seats, it was not bad.  The seats were actually fairly comfortable.  The entertainment system is also good.  When it comes to meal service, Iberia is efficient.  Within about two hours of take-off, lunch was served (this would have been roughly 2:30 p.m.).  It was as good as you expect airline food to be.  However, if you want more than one glass of wine or beer, ask for it the first time they offer it or you will not get another one.  The only beverage they offer more than once is coffee.  Somewhere around six hours later, they brought a snack box out, and about two hours before landing they served sandwiches.  Water, coffee and juice were about the only beverages offered.  In between meals, you rarely see a flight attendant.  They're not the friendliest.

The flight is ok, but beware of the website.",August 2019,"September 12, 2019",3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,3.0

frustration,Madrid,Paris,Europe,"I was book thru an travel agent with Iberia for several legs of my trip. American Airlines partners with Iberia Airlines. 3 of us are traveling. since American partners in Europe. 1 is ticketed only with American, 1 is with American and Iberia and 1 with American and British airlines. Then from Germany to Madrid all 3 are with Iberia. From Madrid to Paris 2 with Iberia. Paris to Barcelona  Iberia partnered with Vueling Airlines. It has taken months to try to try and straighten out the trip from Madrid to Pairs. All flights except that one have check in luggage and seats. The website continues to not recognize that leg of the trip and takes you to Vueling website. The website continues to go down. I have called and called today alone 4 times. Always different story. The luggage was to be included in the trip but Iberia does not reconize and states it is not. I have given up and agreed to pay for the check in bag. I call again and pay ask for a receipt so that there is no further mistakes. Do not want any problems at airport. Finally get a receipt for only one piece. it is one piece per person. Call back again explain one more time is it $30 for one and if 2 persons $60? I'm told $30 but I say it is 2 persons the return trip already had luggage included. if $60 for 2 piece then please provide receipt because then only sent one for $30 for one person. It is one of the most frustrating experiences. Honesty I have no clue of what is going on. Now trying to sell me travel insurance.",September 2019,"September 10, 2019",2.0,,,,,,,,
A maniac in the seat in front of us who shouted to a fellow traveler he had just me for two and a half hours,Lanzarote,Madrid,Domestic,"The check-in process should tell everything you need to know about Iberia: dictatorial, surly attitude towards passengers.  Totally indifferent to reasonable, small questions or requests, hatchet-face sour ground personnel.  Shades of the old, angry Spain I thought had mercifully mellowed into a more civilized society (and my grandparents were all from Spain, just so you know).  The planes are crowded and the seats narrow, uncomfortable.  The flight attendants make little or no effort to make the flight more pleasant, either: they just look past you and go through the routine clearly hating their job.  No effort to conceal their unhappiness.  A huge man in front of us made an instant acquaintance with the man next to him and proceed to shout and laugh thunderously, non-stop, for the two and a half duration of the trip. You could hear this inconsiderate moron all over the plane. No attendant came to ask for respect and consideration for other passengers, who had to endure the ultra-loud conversation/exclamations in what was more of a torture than a flight.  If in the Canary Islands, whether flying from island to island or to mainland Spain, I strongly suggest you use Binter Air---not as well known, but flying the way it used to be: courteous treatment of passengers, roomy two-seaters only, and charming small planes.  I lament that they do not fly to more places where I go; I would use them all the time, but their schedules are limited.  Iberia should ashamed of itself: perhaps the worst airline in Europe.

The wine was in the cutest little bottle.  You got to pick what type of wine you wanted.   They kept coming around asking if you wanted coffee, hot tea or cold tea.   The entertainment was great.

No such luck. No reps at the airports. I tried phoning twice and both times they said they couldn't hear me. The second time I was cut off.
Eventually I gave up and rebooked and paid online via Webjet in Australia. E-tickets arrived within 5 minutes. 
When we turned up for the early morning flight the check-in person insisted our tickets didn't include bags. I was surprised but paid 90 euros, just keen to get away. Then I checked and found we had paid for bags. We tried to get a refund at the 'service' desk at Madrid airport. Again, no joy - they were just an agency issuing tickets. They pointed me to the complaints contact on the Iberia website. But this was just a multiple choice form with no relevant options or comment spaces.

One of us only got the a boarding pass for the first leg of our trip. We made sure that our luggage was checked through to our final destination before leaving the agent. 

Plane took off 20 minutes late, causing us to miss our connecting flight in Madrid. We got to the gate (after RUNNING hard) as the plane was leaving. we were told that we would be put on the next flight, 3.5 hours later.

Arrived in Bilbao and waited and waited for our luggage. We checked all of the carousels to no avail (this took at least 45 minutes). Then we waited in another line to report our lost luggage (that was another 30 minutes). We were told we would have it by 3pm the next day. Really don't understand why it didn't get on our plane in Madrid since they had 3.5 hours to do that.

To add insult to injury, my suitcase came damaged (one corner is completely cracked in several places). It must have been thrown REALLY hard or had another suitcase thrown hard on top of it.

I phoned up and they said they don't guarantee seat reservations and they can change.

Terrible service and organization,Madrid,London,Europe,"Years ago, I traveled with Iberia and my impression was not a good one.  Unfortunately, it was confirmed this time.  In fact, my experience was worst!

Once we checked-in, when it was time for boarding, Business Class was called first.  Then the next group, and so on.  We were taken to a bus that would take us to the plane.  Shortly after we made it to our seat (we were among the last ones to board the plane, even though we had tickets for business class), we were asked to disembark because an employee hit the plane's fuselage with the stairs passengers used to board the plane.

One back in the airport, we were asked to remain by the gate for updates...  All of the sudden, the gate attendant started calling ""Business Class"" Group 1 (without announcing which flight the call was for).  Then, all passengers, regardless of group number, surrounded the counter, desperate to board the plane.

When passengers were scanning their tickets, many beeped as they needed new seats.  The assistants, at that time, asked for passengers by group number.  It was hard to get through as there was a lot of people surrounding the counter.  People kept checking in, if they were not on the group(s) called, they were asked to step aside (in a small area) for others to check in.  When it was our turn, we had to wait to get our new seats.  The new aircraft was different and people needed new seat assignment.

This incident caused us to miss our connecting flight, which was under the same booking but with British Airways.  Nobody in Iberia could help us get details on our next leg.

Utter chaos,Barcelona,London,Europe,"We were supposed to fly from Barcelona to London via a short stopover in Madrid on Monday 2 sept. Our flight to Madrid was delayed. No explanation was given, and no information as to when the flight might depart. We were eventually arrived in Madrid too late to catch our connection to London. We were told to go to Iberia Customer Services where we stood in a queue for an hour. There were 10 desks of which 3 were manned, with a lot of other Iberia staff milling around but not attending to 200 delayed passengers. Eventually we were told that all the flights to London were full and we would not fly until Tuesday morning and were sent to a rubbish airport hotel for the night.
When we returned to the airport we found that the flight we had been booked onto was....cancelled! After 30 minutes I received an email saying that we had been re-booked onto a replacement flight; this was leaving in 50 minutes time from a different terminal which was a 25 minute journey away (according to the airport signs). So we set off, through security, passport control, and train journey to new departure terminal. Except when we got there the airport signs were now showing our departure gate as back where we had just come from. So back we went. 
When we got back to our original gate, the airport signs had changed again; our departure gate was where we had just come from!! At this point we began to suspect that we were being filmed for a candid-camera-style game show. But no, it was actually real. We arrived at the gate with seconds to spare. To be told that the flight was full and we could not board. After complaining to the gate staff for several minutes about our experience thus far, we were taken to one side, and told that they had found 5 places on board and we could go home. Our family was completely split and we sat at opposite ends of the aircraft.
And when we got back to Heathrow we were informed that Iberia had lost our checked luggage.

Punctual amd good service,Buenos Aires,Madrid,International,"I read some bad opinions about flights on this airline, perhaps their economy class is not so good. But we flew on business and everything was excellent. The two completely reclining seats in the middle are together, which is nice if you fly in company. Other airlines have similarly comfortable seats, but they are separated by the wide cabinet in between. The personnel was extremely polite and helpful all the time. Our lunch selection (called dinner according to Spanish time, +5 hours) was first rate, the first course  included a soup, smoked salmon, a good cheese and salad. as main course I selected grilled prawns, only the dessert was perhaps less attractive. I tried two of their three wines offered, both superb, one Rioja and another Duero. Breakfast was also very good in variety. We had a very early arrival and had a couple of hours to reach our connecting flight to another European destination, but we got there easily as the migration went through quickly and even had time to visit the business lounge.",July 2019,"September 6, 2019",5.0,5.0,5.0,,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

What's bad was that the staff gave no explanations. They didn't care. With all the delays, they could have just gave free water to their passengers but they charge for EVERYTHING! The seats were not wide enough for a skinny person body frame.  I'm 140 pounds person with a 30 waist.  Your shoulders will over the width of the seat. There is no leg room at all. You will be crammed.  Their business class seats are as wide as regularseats on the bigger airlines. I would have been upset to pay for business class seats on this plane.  Stay away.

rude hostesses and awful flight experience,Chicago,Madrid,International,"We flew from LA to Bologna via Chicago and Madrid. Chicago-Madrid leg was with Iberia. We tried to book seats in advance. It was impossible from both their website and customer service. I was willing to pay money for my isle seats, but I couldn't.

When we checked in at American Airlines desk in LA, they told us that they couldn't change our seats on the ORD-MAD flight, as these can be changed only in Madrid (really?!), as AA don't have access to seats map ERP software of IBERIA, even if it was one ticket. Teoretically, Iberia and American Airlines are under the same alliance. Welcome to 1995.

So, we had windows seats, and everytime we wanted to stand up, we needed to ask to the person who was sitting in the isle to stand up. 
The problem was that if we were going to the end of the plane, hostesses were telling us that we couldn't stand there unless we were queueing for the toilet. There was no seatbelt sign on, no turbolence, it was just hostess problem that they didn't want to do their job.
I tried to explain that it's healthier to stand up every now and then on an 8 hour flight for the blood circulation, but it was impossible to explain it, as hostess faked to not understanding so much english.

Conclusion of the story, I was willing to pay more for better seats. I coudln't do it. I wasn't allowed to stand up for more than 5 minutes in total on a 8 hour flight. I'll never again fly with this awful company",August 2019,"September 6, 2019",1.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0

Flight to Spain,New York City,Alicante,International,"Flew Iberia from JFK to Alicante Spain. First leg Flight JFK-MAD was on a A350, had an aisle seat in economy. It was the least legroom I think I have ever had (5'11'' and knees had to straddle the seat in front of me)...plane was clean and nice...just very crampt. They provided pillow and blanket, meal and snack. Service was quick and almost rude like, they ran out of options for the meal before getting to me so all I had to chose from was the ""hamburger"" which was actually salsbury steak...not bad but not good either (was in the military so my expectations for food are very low)...I just would have liked a choice...Flight was delayed leaving JFK three hours because of a union strike in Madrid (apparently this happens with them alot??) causing the plane to be delayed getting to JFK. Check in at JFK was quick and easy, to check a bag was an additional $60. They changed my connection in MAD to later in the day, no issues. Seatback entertainment was pretty decent, with good options...the earbuds the give you for free are terrible

Second leg of the flight MAD to ALC was on a small regional jet a CRJ-1000 i believe...the small jet had much more legroom than the one to fly across the Atlantic...that flight was quick and efficient

Would I fly Iberia again....Maybe...depends on the price and the length of the flight....JFK-MAD is about 6.5 hrs which was probably my limit for the space on the first leg...any flight longer and I think I would look elsewhere",August 2019,"September 5, 2019",3.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0
"Trying not to complain on vacation, but.....",Madrid,Barcelona,Domestic,"We came to Europe for our first time and have planned out an amazing 7 week holiday. Our first stop is Barcelona for 3 days. Our flight from the US to Madrid was top notch, we splurged and took first class all the way. Once we arrived in Madrid and switched from American Airlines to Iberia, things changed. My ticket showed that I was in coach, while my hubs was still in 1st class. I asked about upgrading (even though I already paid for a 1st class ticket), they said that it’s full, not possible, it’s full. Ok, no problem, we’ve been traveling for 28 hours at this point, let’s just get there. Turns out that my hubs had a full row to himself, plus there were other open seats in 1st class, but for some reason, they would not allow me to switch seats. Ok, no biggie, let’s just get to Barcelona. When we arrived in Barcelona, my husband’s luggage was lost, apparently it stopped in Madrid. Well, that sucks. All of our power adapters and converters are in his luggage. After waiting over TWO HOURS in the lost luggage line, they assure us it will be delivered the next day, probably on their 1st delivery @ 8:00 am, since they already know where it is. Well, we kept checking our texts and emails all day and finally got one that said it will be delivered between 20:00-23:00. Sweet!! We’ve been waiting at our apartment and nothing came. It’s now a day later and nothing yet. So, we’ve spent over 1/2 our time in Barcelona worrying about his luggage and having to hunt down new power adapters.

After exhaustion of waiting in line with no help from Iberia we called our travel agent.  They said the only option was for to either continue waiting or book another flight.  We decided to book another flight because otherwise we were going to be stuck in Madrid overnight.  Only 2 flights left that day.  We spent $400 dollars on 4 flights and got the heck out.  We then requested a refund from Iberia.  You can not talk with anyone you had to file an online complaint and wait 21 days for a response.

Double Check Airline Carry-on Bag Rules and Seating Space Provided,Los Angeles,Rome,International,"Our flight to Rome on Iberia was a horrible experience.  Our flight back on Iberia to LAX was much improved.  The main difference was luggage (and maybe that was our fault).  On the trip over to Rome, we attempted to carry-on as much luggage as possible on the cheapest seats available.  Well, for that price, Iberia accommodated us with as little luggage and seating space as possible.  There wasn't any leg room if you stored a carry-on underneath your seat.  And the standard economy seats seem built to provide space for a child. 
On our flight home, we paid extra to check-in as much luggage as possible and upgraded our seats to get that extra leg room.  And, even with that, we had a problem with Iberia as they initially placed us in standard economy seats.  We argued with them for 10 minutes (and showed them our receipts for upgraded seats) before we were seated appropriately.  And that re-arrangement of passengers on a full flight initially other explanations (and some arguments)  before the passengers on this flight were finally settled in.

Worst Airline ever,Madrid,Mexico City,International,"I booked 2 flights, one from Amsterdam to Madrid, and the next day from Madrid to Mexico City. 

The first flight; checking in and boarding all went perfect so I had high hopes. The flight was supposed to depart at 12.10 - at 11.50 everyone was seated and basically ready to go. We were left waiting until 13.15!!! Until we left. It was an Iberia express flight so the food and beverages were being charged. Multiple people missing their connecting flights in Madrid. I was checking out of the airport to spend a night in Madrid. Waiting for luggage was another disaster. Our luggage was announced on the screen to be already on the belt - which was not true. Only a few suitcases were on the belt, the rest of us had to wait an additional 40 minutes before our luggage arrived. Worst experience ever. 

Flight from Madrid to Mexico: since this is a flight carried out by Iberia, instead of Iberia Express, I was hoping that the check-in and boarding went as smooth or even better than the day before. Check in was fine, boarding unfortunately was not. We are delayed immediately at boarding while the plane is waiting outside and luggage is being loaded.

I was so freaking shocked!!! OMG
This is my first in my life I knew that this crazy situation even can happen.
The airline company should have known how many passengers are traveling on every occasion, not speculating the number of traveling passengers.
In the end, my boarding entrance was denied, so was my wife’s. The staffs couldnt guarantee what time the next flight to madrid is. So I was just told to wait until given the further information. 
I’ve travelled so far from Asia to Spain. I’ve well planned my rundown list to do in Madrid, furthermore I only got 3 days to spend in Madrid, so time is the most important issue here.

Terrible experience!,Boston,Barcelona,International,"First of all, we booked our flight on Iberian because it was the only airline that offered a direct flight from Boston to Barcelona.

We arrived at the airport early so as to make certain that everything went smoothly.  Our first disappointment was when, at 4:00 p.m., we learned that no one would be at the Iberian counter until 8:30 p.m. for an 11:10 p.m. flight.  So, we had to sit in the airport lobby for more than 4 hours.  When we noticed that people were queuing for the flight, we saw that the Iberian signs had been replaced by signs reading ""Level Airlines"".  Having no idea what happened to Iberian, I approached the agent to ask and was told, quite rudely, that Iberian had subbed the flight to Level Airlines.  

We got into the queue because we had one bag to check and needed to check in and get seat assignments.  Our next shock was that it cost us $55.00 to check the bag!  Then we learned that our seat assignments were nothing like what we had requested and, after some hassle, were able to get seats near, but not next to, each other (fortunately, another passenger was willing to switch seats so that we could, in fact, sit together for the 7 hour flight.

Next, came dinner service -- which, passed right by us.  I stopped the flight attendant to ask about dinner and was asked whether we had ordered and paid for it ahead of time?  I said that we had not and she said that we could buy something from the flight menu if we wanted dinner.  I asked for a Diet Coke and was told that it was 5 euros!  It turns out that the ONLY thing that was FREE on the flight was WATER.  Can you imagine a 7 hour flight with no services at all???  At the conclusion of the flight, I asked why there were no services and was told that Level is a budget airline and the decision had been made to allow people to choose what they wanted to pay for.  She told me that, had we flown Iberian, we would have had full service.

At no time, from the time I booked the flight to check-in, was I made aware that we would not be flying Iberian airlines.  For the money we paid I would have expected better service and, at the very least some notice, from Iberian that we would not be flying the airline we expected to be flying.

My wife was not given a boarding pass for the connection flight. A lady in the connection office gave her a ticket written on hand. She forgot to write the last name, so it was not accepted in the security control. We had to run back. We almost lost the flight.

Although it is not a low-cost company, there was no lunch. We asked to buy a sandwich, but there were no sandwiches left. They had only 5 pieces for a flight of more than 150 passengers.

The airplanes also contribute to the worst-airline experience. The seats are extremely inconvenient and do not lean back if you want to sleep (in 3 out of 4 airplanes we used). Those who managed to sleep got a neck ache. Some lucky guys had 3 seats to lay on.

Both toilets had problematic wash basins, and when you entered they still had the water of the previous person. None of the toilets had cream soap. I reported this to the attendant and they said they have soap in a cupboard. Should I guess it or shall I guess that they do not want people to spend their soap?

Overall it was the worst experience ever.

Generally ok,  nothing special certainly not in the same league as the far eastern and middle eastern carriers. The food was fine but there was an absence of drinks on offer,  the stewards literally came around once for drinks except with breakfast and dinner. We were backpacking and the airline lost our luggage, which was a real inconvenience as we were not staying in the first location long. To their credit they did get it to  As compensation we were given a small plastic wallet with a tea shirt, shorts, toothbrush and a mini tube of toothpaste!! In comparison, Emirates gave us $200 dollars when it happened to us two years earlier.

Awful Flight with Iberia Airlines,Rio de Janeiro,Madrid,International,"We have just flown back to the UK from Rio  on Iberia via Madrid. We are well travelled and I have never given low feedback
Like this before. The only plus was the flight was on time. For a long over night flight it was awful. The crew had arguments with some passengers over food choices. All they kept saying was “it’s not my fault” once they had served an awful dinner and one round of drinks we did not see them again until the light breakfast before landing in Madrid. Unlike other airlines who come around with water or juices during the flight Iberia crew were no where to be seen very much leaving it to you to get your own at the back of the plane. I don’t expect a constant flow of being woken up in the night but a bit of attention might go down well. Also there were midges on the plane and I ended up with 13 bites on my legs during the flight.

Avoid,Seville,New York City,International,"Flying with Iberia is flying at the mercy of Unions and their well known inclination to seek strikes during travel peak seasons.

The right to strike is not the purpose of the review. The dismal and negligent response by the company is.

Telephone numbers that are always busy and stereotyped “customer oriented” responses that do not clarify but confuse and complicate more an already rather unpleasant situation, seem to be the norm for this Airline

Called 4 times after receiving an email indicating that the original flight was cancelled. Surprisingly, none of the representatives seemed to know that the flight was cancelled and thus could not reroute/rebook the flight.

Be prepare to add to the irritation a “zero flexibility” attitude by the representative, a dose of misinformation, and countless references to “policies” that one cannot verify, and the good old circular conversation style that can only be broken when one requests to speak with a supervisor (needless to say one who is not available). Only then, we begun to gain some traction.

Not a fan 😬,London,Madrid,Europe,"We were booked with British Airways but Iberia ended up supplying the flight. 
On the way to Madrid we had a plane that seemed to be brand new. The seats on it were so uncomfortable. Hard plastic and no headrest at all. I was nearly crippled by the end of the flight. On the return journey to Heathrow I booked exit seats so that we had more space. This time the plane was older and the seats were much more comfortable. So... I know that Iberia is a Spanish airline but this was my bug bear- the captain (on both flights) would say what he had to say first in Spanish and then in English. When they were speaking in English it’s was as if they couldn’t spit the words out fast enough and you couldn’t make out a word they were saying. It’s as if they were sick of repeating the same thing twice. 
Cabin crew were Spanish and I found them to be quite abrupt(both flights) which surprised me as the Spanish people I had encountered in Madrid were extremely friendly. 
On the flight home we had turbulence which resulted in the seat belt sign being on for half of the flight. This meant that the cabin crew only had a short time to serve refreshments. Business class, with about 20 passengers,had 2 cabin crew serving them. Economy had 1  member of  cabin crew trying to serve the rest of the flight by himself which was ridiculous.
When I’ve flown with other airlines you always get little updates from the flight deck about how high you’re flying and what you are about to fly over. (I find this kind of information helpful as I’m a very nervous flyer and if the flight deck are giving us little updates I know we’re ok!😂)

The level of quality on both services was absolutely equal, which it proves reliability.
On both occasions the flight has departed on time and arrived a few minutes before expected.
Weather was clement and there was no significant turbulence, what makes it more enjoyable.
The food deserves a mention, it not only was more than generous in sizes but the best that I ever had in an aircraft.

The ride already a nightmare hair raisingly rough for the last hour. I’m sure more skilful pilots could have handled better. I’ve made the mistake of using Iberia before for this trip, and based on that experience I’d rate my chances of getting to Dakar on schedule as no more than 10%. In one piece, physically and mentally, 50-50. Baggage arrival, 25% no more. 

This lot have form for embarking passengers then disembarking them as they find a fault, my last Dakar trip we got on and off the plane 3 times at Madrid without taking off. That was in December, Iberia have a unique way of handling compensation claims for such ineptitude, they just ignore them. I’ve engaged a claim management company and they’ve finally nailed Iberia to coughing up, in the next 42 days...about 11 months after the messed up flight. 

Basically, avoid. I’m not sure why I booked this time. By the way I understand Iberia are now owned by British Airways.

Avoid avoid avoid,New York City,Palermo,International,"This is by far the worst airline we have ever flown. We flew using Iberia last year to Madrid and it was a bad experience, but foolishly decided to fly them again this past August for our trip to Sicily.

Unfortunately, our experience on July 31, 2019, proved to be far below our expectations. While we understand that there can be unforeseen delays during air travel, the length of the delay and the manner in which it was handled left much to be desired. The delay caused us to miss an entire day of our trip, which we spent in Madrid airport rather than at  our destination. 

We were scheduled to fly at 17:05 from JFK to MAD, where we were to connect to Palermo on an Iberia flight at 8:35 on August 1, 2019. Upon our arrival at JFK, we observed that the flight was delayed until 18:30. This raised significant concern as we feared we would miss our connecting flight, but we were assured by Iberia agents that we would still make our connecting flight despite the delay.

We waited in Terminal 7 at JFK for information about our flight. Surprisingly, there were no gate agents available to provide any information regarding what time the flight would take off. An agent finally arrived at the gate around 18:15 and stated that the flight would depart at 19:35. Once again, we were assured by an agent that we would make our connecting flight and she refused to reschedule our connecting flight when we asked her to do so.

We waited in a chaotic crowd to board the plane. We boarded our flight and sat down in our seats at 19:30; however, the  flight did not depart JFK for another hour and a half, until 21:05. Again, there were no announcements made regarding the reason for the delay. 

We arrived in Madrid and met with an agent regarding the connecting flight we missed due to the delay. We were told our best option was to take an additional two flights, one from Madrid to Milan, followed by Milan to Palermo using what we were told was Bulgaria Airlines. We were only provided with a new itinerary for this flight. We were told we would have to find the airline upon landing to receive our boarding passes.

We asked multiple agents throughout our eight hour delay in Madrid what to do to ensure that our bags were moved along with us, and each stated, “Don’t worry it is our job to get the bags on the plane.”

The flight from Milan to Palermo concerned us because there were only 55 minutes between the flights. When we arrived in Milan an hour late due to another delayed Iberia flight, we frantically searched for Bulgaria Airlines. There was not a single flight by this airline. Desperately, we stopped at an Alitalia information desk and showed them the booking details Iberia had provided. 

While preparing to leave for Madrid, we double checked with the gate agent to ensure our bags were on the plane. She looked at our reservation and told us our bags were sitting downstairs unaccounted for. Thankfully, the agent was kind enough to issue an alert through the system that our bags needed to be onboard our flight. Unfortunately, our baggage was left in Madrid and did not make it on the plane. 

We eventually landed in Palermo 13 hours later than our original scheduled arrival time and our luggage was not delivered. This was due to our baggage not being correctly recoded after our new connecting flight was assigned. 

We did not receive our bags until over a week after we arrived home which was 21 and 23 respectively from when they were originally lost. This added unneeded stress and aggravation. We have reached out to Madrid airport and Iberia about the missing luggage and have found the customer service agents to be rude, even to the point of being hung up on so as to avoid assisting us.

We have never experienced such rude customer service and a complete lack of concern for customers as we have with your airline. From l gate agents, to customer service representatives at MAD airport to, surprisingly, the lost baggage department, a place you would expect to find empathy more than any other.",August 2019,"August 25, 2019",1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,,

Avoid Iberia at all costs,Madrid,Copenhagen,Europe,"I had to travel with Iberia from Granada to Copenhagen (via Madrid) and had booked my tickets online.Unfortunately, during my stay in Granada, many documents, including my credit card, were stolen.

They claimed it was necessary in order to verify my identity as a customer. Despite having shown them my other ID cards and a copy of the police report stating that my credit card was stolen, the entirely rude and arrogant Iberia staff at the airport demanded that I had to buy a new ticket- which I did in desperation because I had to get this flight. After this humiliating experience I had sworn to never use Iberia again. Unfortunately, I recently had to buy a ticket for my wife and the only connection available was with Iberia. When I tried to purchase the ticket online, the booking could not be completed and I had to try again. Nevertheless, the money was withdrawn from my account - without having received a ticket or even a confirmation, of course. Some minutes later, I was able to purchase the same ticket with even the same seat number again - and I was charged a second time. Since then, I have tried to get Iberia to return my money.

Its high time somebody founded a competitor,Santander,Madrid,Domestic,"As I had earlier flown with this airline, I was cautious and sceptical, and wondered if it wasn¨t better to take the train from Santander to Madrid. It would take only 5 hours after all, but at least I knew that it would be reliable. 

As i knew what Iberia was capable of, I booked my flight to Madrid a day earlier, just in case, I had to take a later flight, or something happened. Indeed, you would never be bored with Iberia! Best entertainment guaranteed!

The flight at 1350 was overbooked, and at check-in, a friendly employee informed me, but also reassured me that they would make sure I got to Madrid. I had a flight to Norway scheduled the day after, so I was a bit worried. 

After calling and checking with the agencies, they told me they could not do anything, and basically the Tripmonster employee told me that it was silly the flight was overbooked and they could not do anything to help me. I had no rights, despite the fact that i had paid for a flight that cost me more than 200 euros.

Needless to say, I was upset, and tried to stay calm. I teared up on a multiple occoasions, I saw the Spaniards around me - they managed to keep a straight face. I asked all the employees what could be done, they said I had to wait. So I waited and waited.

There was that blond lady, whom I also met at the check in, who was very nice, and reassured me again, a few times, along with a hug, that I would fly to Madrid and I would even sleep ther. I think she deserves a raise! In the end, she indeed made sure. She said  - I would get to fly because  I was kind. 

That made me think, dear Iberia, are your employees subject to bullying and rude behavior due to your idiotic decisions? You are so messy, I just wonder how you are still in business, and I hope someone founded a competitor company, hope it is someone from abroad, so that at least your employees could get a better alternative and the passengers get to fly without experiencing emotional damages!

Iberia Airlines over book seats,Porto,Madrid,Europe,"My friends and I arrived at the Porto Iberia Airlines check in desk 2 hours 15 minutes before a 12:30pm flight to Madrid. We gave the man our Qantas Frequent Flyer number which was printed on our boarding pass, but we were told that they couldn't allocate us seat numbers as flight IB3093 was over booked by 10 people. But we should go through security anyway to the departure lounge in case lots of people didn't turn up. He said if we couldn't get on our flight which was booked 8 months ago, we would be compensated up to 300 Euros and get on a later flight. So we went to gate 7 to be first in the queue when boarding commenced. When boarding commenced we were told to go to the back of the queue. Then at 5 minutes before takeoff we were told they are no availability for us and to wait while they sorted the matter out. This took about 20 minutes and we were told to go up to gate 31 where someone would meet us with new boarding passes for a later flight. A lady turned up around 1pm and was most apologetic about the overbooking and mentioned that the next Iberia flight was overbooked with 14 people. So she had arranged for us to fly to Madrid with TAP Air Portugal and gave us boarding passes (without Qantas Frequent Flyer numbers as TAP is not in the One World Alliance) for the 1:45pm flight TP1010 from gate 33. This TAP flight left 15 minutes late, so overall we arrived in Madrid one and a half hours late and without any Qantas frequent flyer points. On arrival at Madrid we had to catch a bus from terminal 2 to the Iberia office in terminal 4 to get a token 125 Euro Visa Card payment for the inconvenience caused, I wouldn't recommend flying with any airline like Iberia which makes a habit of overbooking.

AVOID FRAUDULENT AIRLINE,Miami,Madrid,International,"I tend not to write negative reviews, even when I’ve had less than stellar service. However, I will never trust or recommend IBERIA, they are by far the WORST airline I’ve ever used. It would be 0 stars if I could. It all started with our outbound flight from Miami to Madrid. We purchased premium economy and  they decided to sit the three of us, including our 2 yr old son separately. Come on it’s a 2 year old, by regulation he has to sit next to one of his parents. But this was just the start. On our return trip when we got to the counter at Madrid they inform us that the flight is overbooked and we have been placed on standby. We had actually purchased premium economy seats for our vacation, which are almost 3 times the cost of economy and had also previously selected and paid for seats online to ensure we were together. Regardless they inform us that we had been placed in standby and that this seems to be a common occurrence lately. The gentleman on the check-in desk managed to find us tickets in coach and we were very grateful, however there is a major price difference, approximately $1000 per ticket or so... he informed us that he was not authorized to give us the refund and to head on to customer service. The first window for customer service tells us there nothing they can do, that it must be online. Online / over the phone tells me there’s nothing they can or will do, tough luck. The next service representative in Madrid, Maria, became very rude towards my wife and refused to acknowledge or guide us with our concerns. She yelled at us that there would be no refund of our money and it was up to us wether we wanted to leave in the flight or not for the same price we had paid, mind you a forced and uncompensated downgrade. We decided to leave on the flight and figure it out independently thru Amex since we made the purchase on their site. American Express started an investigation. At the gate we encountered several Spanish families from either premium economy and/or business class that had been downgraded as well without compensation or refund. Apparently this is not unsual for Iberia... on the return flight the service was appalling and rude yet again. To the point that my wife was even physically pushed to the side by one of the attendants when she was trying to calm our 2 yo son near the back of the plane.

Absolute Nightmare - MASSIVE BAGGAGE PROBLEMS,Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,London,Europe,"What a nightmare, honestly. Iberia are probably the rudest, incompetent airlines I have ever flown with. The flight itself on the way back was terrifying considering the flight attendant was praying next to me on the way down… 
Anyway, the flight itself wasn’t the problem really. It was the Baggage going missing for a week. I decided to make a few calls the day after we flew to see if I could see if they had located the bags and that they were on their way (8 bags in total as 8 of us flew to Gran Canaria). All I got was they could only find one bag, the other seven were missing. After being on the phone for 3 and half hours a gentleman told me that all 8 bags arrived at Heathrow 8:25am on Saturday which he checked the flight number and he told me they were organising delivery – THIS WAS A HUGE LIE. 
A few more phone calls were exchanged, and delivery time was made, On Tuesday – one bag out of eight came and it was destroyed ripped open and battered. I was livid, I rang Iberia to have a lady called Marther pick up the phone, who told me all the bags were at Heathrow a second lie, she was rude… unhelpful and told me I had to go to the airport to sort it? Now I knew they were lying because the bag which had come said the time it arrived and when it flew in which was the day before they delivered it – Monday not Saturday. Their delivery driver also told us that they can only keep the bags for a certain amount of time, or they get fined. I rang again later and they told us they had located all the other 7 bags and they would be delivered on Thursday. 
Thursday came we received a text saying they would come between 21:59pm – 00.02am so we waited, to only receive four more other suitcases. Which again had said they flew in the day before they were delivered… So in total three suitcases were still missing, by this time I had lost my patience. I rang Iberia again… to speak to a lady called Rajia (think that’s what she said). Who shouted at me? Sorry last I checked this was Iberias mistake? Not Mine! She was rude and unhelpful. So I put the phone down because she was just shouting at me and I refused to be sat and shouted at for something which is not my mistake! 
Friday came and after work I rang a lady who located all the final three suitcases and told me I had to go and pick them up (although Iberia said they would deliver every single one to us when we landed without them) at this point I was extremely fed up so I just went hoping for the best. At Heathrow I came across the first polite and helpful member of staff that works for Iberia his name was Gillisanin (think that’s how it was spelt) and he is an absolute star. He instantly was on it, he took my number and went down to baggage and came back within an hourish with all the bags most efficient staff member. I was over the moon. 
It should not have taken 40 phone calls to get my bags back. I shouldn’t of had to drive to pick them up when it was their mistake. The bags are battered to pieces.  The staff are rude, incompetent and the most unhelpful people ive ever met (accept the gentleman at the airport who I spoke to yesterday wish more staff were like him!!). Fly with this airline if you want something cheap however pack your important belongings in hand luggage because you might not see it for a while…",August 2019,"August 17, 2019",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,5.0

The first leg was with American Airlines which was fine the rest of the flights are were the trouble began. It turns out that even though we were a family of four traveling with a 4 and a 5 year old they gave us all different seats on every flight! I get that the concept is that you have to pay to pick your seats but its has to have some common sense! For example a 4 year old needs to be seating with an adult on a 9 hour flight!!

"If you want your vacation ruined, fly Iberia",New York City,Vigo,International,"If you ever visit Spain, and you should, do not fly Iberia. We haven’t flown them in years and I booked the tix not realizing they are now allied/partnering with American Airlines. Every time we flew them in the past, our luggage was either completely lost or showed up a day or two later. And they did it again. My 15 year old son's suitcase went  missing. Got a text the next morning that it was found and would be delivered that day between 11:00 - 22:00. It didn't show up. My kid has no clothes other than what he wore on the plane so he had to borrow my 89 year old dad's clothing. The second morning there, I received a text that the suitcase was delivered. It obviously wasn't. We decided to take a taxi to the airport and that's where we found it. In a room all by it's lonesome. Another taxi back to the house. 
Also, seating. I prepaid our seats. Got to JFK, the woman at the check-in counter gave us other seats that weren't even together. I refused to leave the counter until she gave us the appropriate seats. Connecting flight, separate seats. When we were at the airport to pick up the lost suitcase, I stopped by the Iberia sales desk to check on our seats for the return flight. Oh yes, your seats are reserved. Guess what, no they weren't. Had the same issue going home. I had to ask someone to switch seats with my kid so we could sit together on the flight from MAD to JFK (in the last row of the plane no less).

2)  the business class seats appeared uncleaned when boarding.
3) The in-flight entertainment took approximately 45 minutes to start and then was interrupted by constant unimportant messages.
4) the plane was 45 minutes late to take off. Reportedly, because of the heat, the plane needed more fuel.  Sounds unplanned.
5) The incorrect meal was delivered. Reportedly because an lessor number of meals were delivered.
6) The stewardess seemed more busy chit chatting amongst themselves than servicing the passengers.

Case study in poor corporate culture.,Boston,Stockholm,International,"Much is written in how a leader extends his or her values to staff and how employees are given a sense of pride in ownership. This empowerment is then reflected as a part of them and how they treat others and to feel the frustration of the customer. If the reader agrees with these values, then Iberia Air is not for you.
My wife promised her young nephew his first trip to Europe, As this was his first long flight, she purchased two seats next to each other. The customer service agent at BOS would not honor these seats and said only one seat was paid. Unless one has a bladder issue, who would pay an extra $67 to sit two rows in front of the toilet at the back of the plane? She asked to speak to the manager. The manager would not view the documents proving the seats were purchased and began venting her anger on my wife, humiliating her in public and in front of her nephew and this went on for 10 minutes as the line grew longer. Unfortunately, her badge was reversed and so her name was not up front. I wrote to Iberia Facebook customer service and they responded days later to fill out a form. I also wrote to a VP and the CEO and they never responded or forwarded the email to exec. customer service which is normally the protocol, especially when one of their employees goes off the loose end. The plane ride to Madrid was fine except the airline attendants were slow to answer and a request for warm tea meant serve it when it is late and tepid.
On the flight from MAD to ARN, the refreshments were free. From ARN to MAD the refreshments were not free. 
In MAD at the ticket counter, they were again separated although they were previously assured in BOS that they would sit together on return. 
If there were more ways for an airline to say, Please no longer fly us, we are not worthy, it is few and far between. Perhaps their actions said it for them and we are more than convinced they have it right for once.  The need for leadership and employees to ""feel the need of frustration"" of the customer was not meant as fermenting it, but alleviating it.

Do not use,Quito,Madrid,International,"I swore not to fly it after my last flight 10+ years ago, but decided to try them again and REGRET IT!!! 

Service is deplorable. They could not get me a ticket with luggage on it and said I had to pay for luggage at the airport, but they couldn't tell me how much it would cost. The website kept crashing every time I tried to check in both going and coming back a month later. On my way going to Quito, they charged me about $50 per bag, which I thought was ok, but on the way back, all of a sudden I was charged $490!! How did it go from $100 to $490.... the only thing the lady could say was ""it's how your ticket was booked mam."" It was outrageous. For $600 I could have gone with KLM or any other airline because they are all , except for American Airlines and United, better than this.

The plane is mediocre, the seats not that great and not much room. I'm comparing to KLM, Qatar Airways, Delta, Avianca, which are good airlines. Iberia does not fall in this category. 

Chicken or pasta.. if you travel a lot, you are aware that these are almost your options, Veg and nonveg. But Iberia only had nonveg options, so when I told them, they said ""You didn't order veg so there is no food for you."" that was it, 10hr flight with no food for me. In Qatar airways, they even gave me apples, bananas, as extras in case I couldn't eat what they served me which was veg! 

As you can see from the above comments, the friendliness is just not there. They are there to show you that they are better than you even though they are simply serving you.... it is horrible.

WORST AIRLINE EVER!!!!!!!!,Palma de Mallorca,Valencia,Domestic,"I traveled from JFK to LONDON to MALLORCA to VALENCIA. My flight was delayed from Mallorca to Valencia and I missed my flight.

Easy and straight forward airline,London,Madrid,Europe,"The Iberia services from and to London have improved a lot in the past year. Boarding is done quite quickly, following priority queues. The onboard meal service (paid for) offers a decent selection of snacks (although they don’t cater very well for allergies). Most planes have USB chargers under the seats, although I never found one that actually worked.
If you travel on Iberia Express, you also have access to a very good onboard entertainment selection (latest movie releases, tv series and documentaries). The downside is that the route is often too short to watch a full movie. 
On the London-Madrid route, most planes now land on T4, as opposed to T4S (the satellite terminal), which makes a huge difference in terms of time if you are connecting with another flight.",August 2019,"August 7, 2019",4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,,,

Worst service ever!,Madrid,San Jose,International,"On the last 16th July me and my husband were travelling from Oporto to San José , Costa Rica through Madrid. We had 1 hour to do the connection but as both flights were with Iberia and booked through a travel agency we thought it wont be a problem. But there was. 
The flight from Oporto to Madrid was delayed on departure and on the arrival which left us with 30 minutes to get to the gate. Our flight was supposed to leave at 11h35 and we got there just at 11h30. The airplane were there but the door of the gate was already closed. 
As soon as we arrived the land stewart with a very low customer service said: where were you? And I said - at an Iberia flight which was 2 times delayed. She answer - ahhhhhhh, i need to check with the airplane crew if you still can board because we have have already transfered you to the flight tomorrow morning and neverthless i think theres no enough food at the airplane. WtF? No enough food at an 1250 euros flight each? 
Obviously we laughed and ask if you please to let us go in. She called the airplane and said a joke about us (we speak Spanish and understood) and the stewart at the otherside said that we should travel on the following morning, as she wont open the door.
Iberia gave us accomodation and meals at a hotel closed to the airport (which what was our surprise has a meals room just for Iberia clients - which i think it says a lot about this company).
We have paid 2500 euros for both our flights and had this miserable service. beyond the fact we have lost a day of holidays in costa rica which is priceless, we have to pay for a day of car Rental and 2 nights at the hotels in San José and santa Theresa which we didnt use.
What is more funny is that on the following day our flight to San José departed with 20 minutes delay due to Iberia check-ins issues and for us they didnt open the door on the previous day.

Cancelled with no explanation and no refunds,Boston,Madrid,International,"Flight was cancelled after a six hour delay and two gate changes. We still have no idea why. Every step was mishandled. The gate showed the status as on time hours after we were supposed to leave. Eventually we were told to go back out of the gate and line up at certain booths to get out luggage and figure out when we fly. No one was at the counter for an hour. When the few people got there they offered a voucher for a hotel way out in the suburbs and some food. Nothing for transportation and no explanation and not very nice either. It was already far too late for any kitchen to be open and we had already eaten. No one knew anything. The counter people said to call the customer service line and customer service said the flight still showed as on time to them and to talk to the agents at the counter. So far we missed the first night in Madrid (pre booked hotel), likely to miss our train (also pre booked and non refundable) paid for transportation both ways to the airport and actually don’t know if we’ll get to Spain at all.

Terrible experience flying from Naples/Madrid/Miami,Naples,Miami,International,"My husband and I took an Iberia flight to Madrid from Naples, Italy today and would never consider this airline again.  We had issues with confirming flights even before we left for our trip - I had to call several times to get info on our flights.  We were in Capri prior to going to Naples for the flight and literally spent over an hour trying to get checked in on line.  We finally had our hotel concierge call and they were told that the website had had a glitch for several days and we couldn’t check in on-line - we had to get boarding passes at the airport.  We got to airport by 5:30 am and didn’t have an issue fortunately.  The first flight to Madrid was a smaller plane and extremely cramped, old and worn. My husband could barely get his legs to fit into the seat.  The flight was over 2 hours and they didn’t serve anything to drink or eat. Our next flight was from Madrid to Miami in Premium Economy. They delayed the flight for about an hour even though the plane had been there for hours - no explanation and no announcement.  Once aboard, the seats were an improvement as they were wider and more legroom but not nearly as much as other airlines’ Premium economy.  The seats were hard though and hurt both my husband and my backs.  I sat in the blanket they provided the whole way to cushion the seat.  The attitude of the crew except for one nice flight attendant was nasty and rude.  They gave us 2 small cups of water and one small bottle for the 10 hour flight.  We were given a mediocre chicken dish for lunch and a bagel with ham and cheese for a snack before we landed.  No other snacks were offered throughout the flight. Premium is just behind Business class and there is lavatory between them.  The only other lavatories were all the way in the back by economy or in First class. The male flight attendant forbade anyone in Premium to use the lavatory closest to us- claiming it was only  for Business. Meanwhile the lav’s in Economy were a disaster about 7 hours into the flight- the sink was stopped up, almost no tissue and paper the floor was soaked with urine.

After another 15 minutes I asked, if the Purser will try to solve he problem. - NE - he was busy Aftrer another 15 Minutes he SHOWED UP and tried to speak in well trained calm voice to kee the problem a personal secret between us. Anyway, after another 15 minutes he came with some CREW-blankets; so we could isolate (WE COULD ISOLATE) the icy hole in the Air-frame. 
Bad flight and NO single rmark, a glas of wine ore SOMETHING. NOTHING.

disappointed,Dublin,New York City,International,"We had been assigned seats since January for our flight home from Ireland in July. On the plus side, the movie selection and food was great. My husband and I were traveling with our 2 teen sons. we had the exit row and the row behind - 2 in each row with what looked like a 3rd empty seat. When we got to the gate my husband and I were told we were being ""upgraded"" so Our seats had been changed. When we got on the plane, we found that not only were we not upgraded but we were moved away from our kids and put in a row on the side with crowed legroom, leaving the exit row empty. At the time I was wearing a boot on my foot so was told that this is the reason I was moved, although I would later find an email telling me of the change that was delivered prior to our arrival so they wouldn't have known. I asked a flight attendant if our row could just be switched with our kids and they could have the exit row. She told me no and that it was a full flight. As we were getting ready to take off, an elderly couple asked to be moved into our original seats in the exit row and I was really angry about that. I voiced my complaint to the attendants who apologized but there was nothing to be done. Just did not seem like a fair practice to be switched at the gate without explanation and for someone else less capable of taking care of the exit row to be able to sit there. When it is very obvious that a flight is not full, the attendants shouldn't tell people it is. We also had a flight from Dublin to Madrid on the express which was very uncomfortable.",July 2019,"July 28, 2019",2.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0

Worst airline ever,Alicante,Los Angeles,International,"Our leisure flight from Alicante to Los Angeles turned into an absolute nightmare when our Alicante flight was delayed over 1 hour and a half due to plane being late, disorganization with coordination and lack of professionalism by Iberian personnel. All in all, we ended up missing our plane to Los Angeles. We never ever were told or helped by Iberian personnel regarding our connection. After waiting at the Iberian ticket counter in Madrid for over 3 hours due to the fact that there was only one person behind customer service, we finally got rerouted via NY the day after. Upon our arrival In NY, we were sent to American Airlines because that is the connection they gave us only to find out that we are no longer allowed to take over 2 pieces of luggage and we had to pay to check them in again after originally paying 100 euros in Alicante. 

The food on the plane was beyond terrible and completely unbeatable and the air helpers were definitely not the friendliest of them all. A terrible experience! I will NEVER EVER fly Iberia again.

Worst flight experience,Barcelona,Boston,International,I flew Iberia from Barcelona to Boston. They boarded on time but had to shuttle us to the plane which I understand happens sometimes but then left 3 packed shuttles with little to no AC sitting on the runway for 20 minutes while we watched several members of the crew look at something on the plane that needed fixing. They finally let us on and the pilot told us it would be 5-10 minutes while they checked something. 2 hours later we took off. Unless you buy a meal for the flight you will not even be offered food or drink. I had to get up and ask for a glass of water halfway through the flight. We finally landed in Boston and again we were told 5-10 minutes we would have to wait before getting off. After 50 minutes we finally got to get off the plane.

LESS THAN AVERAGE,New York City,Funchal,International,"Iberia did little to improve upon their 62 ranking. First, I could not print eight Boarding Passes for Departure or Return, After three calls to the airline about Departure and three different excuses I just waited till we arrived at the airport. They still did not have an answer. The reason, we surmised later, was because the tickets were purchased through a travel agent. Others had the same problem who had booked through 3rd parties. Second, on Departure, our party of eight were scattered throughout the plane. These were tickets purchased months in advance. My wife and I flew back later and we were separated as were many others - including children - leading to boarding chaoss. Seating space is insanely limited. I'm 5'6"" tall. I pity anyone taller. Third, One in our group is disabled. Guidance on what to do was limited and caused issues. Fourth, on the trip flight from Madrid to Funchal (2 1/2 hrs), water was a cost item, really? Everyone, every person, airline or airport, was very friendly only to be made to look stupid by airline policies. Last, luggage pick up at JFK took one hour plus. I love to travel. I hate airlines.

Worse airline I have traveled in my life,Miami,Madrid,International,"One of the worst airline in term of customer service and courtesy I experienced. We booked the ticket through finnair which is their partner airline and requested vegetarian meal. First thing, it didn't allow to check in online. Second, they didn't provide the meal we requested and when asked, they said they didn't have that request and were very rude even after showing them the printout which clearly had the meal preference. After making us feel guilty, they provided the regular meal which was vegetarian so I didn't understand why all the drama. After the flight, when we went to the counter to get that preference put in their system so we have it for our return flight, while the person was looking into computer, I casually mentioned the incident that happened in flight, she refused to help me by saying it is your meal preference and I should call finnair since I booked through them. I tried to show her the paper which already had the meal preference, she refused to see or help and said I should go on their main terminal and ask for the customer service. And most important, in all these conversations, everyone was rude even with the first sentence which I didn't understand why. Similar experience while coming back as well.

Apalling service,London,Cusco,International,"I travelled from London, UK to Madrid, Spain to Lima, Peru to Cusco, Peru. The flights from Spain to Peru were partnered with Latam Airlines. It started in London where we had to wait hours in the plane for them to finally say that the flight was cancelled. After which the airlines did not say where to go to organise new flight details therefore everyone reached the airport and were very lost. After finally finding the area I had to wait in a queue only to find that after an hour of waiting they couldn't organise new flight details themselves instead we should receive an email with our new flights. After hours I waited and tried to call the Iberia airline and they kept saying that the fight wasn't cancelled on their system. Finally in the night they managed to get new flights. I came in the next day for the new flight however there was an issue for some reason with the flights they organised. They then dealt with this after checking in. Then when entering the flight they took my boarding pass and said it was invalid and didn't count and that they have to take my luggage off the plane without even confirming my tickets. Then after asking, they checked that everything was okay and let me through without even apologising. After all of that I reached Lima to get my luggage and I found out that they lost it! After calling them constantly they finally found my luggage 5 DAYS LATER! Which was most of my trip gone and I had to spend lots of time buying new clothes which just ruined my whole trip. I had also planned to go hiking in Cusco so had to buy new walking boots and hiking clothes specifically. After 5 days the airline didn't even reimburse me as they only do so if the luggage was lost.

DO NOT FLY IBERIA,Porto,Atlanta,International,"I travel a lot, I have flown countless discount airlines in the past domestically and usually just go for the cheap flight. I had never flown Iberia before this (flew round trip from Atlanta to porto), it was Iberia but through American Airlines so I figured why not, American isn’t too bad an airline and international flights are typically nicer than domestic (I’ve flown 2 other airlines internationally with great service). The plane is VERY old, no TV’s in back of seats, only in isles, and you can’t even watch them because half the planes sound wasn’t working. The seats were smaller than other domestic flights even and the food was also worse than any other flight I have ever been on. On top of this the flight attendants were not the friendliest I have encountered, we had issues with our sound  to hear the singular subpar movie that was playing on the isle TVs and they said if only we paid to be a part of the “club” they would help us out, but since we weren’t we were out of luck and entertainment of any sort for a 7 hour flight (couldn’t even use my own device because unless you had already downloaded the American app to watch their shows you were again, out of luck) plus if you had downloaded show or the app and wanted to use your phone it was just going to die anyways, because there was no outlets to charge (I’ve never been on an international flight even in economy without outlets). Now let’s just talk about  checkin, which you can only do 2 hours early (there is no one there earlier) and there was no option to checkin online and no kiosks to do so at the airport ourselves. Which means standing at the airport desk for well over an hour (because Iberia sends an email telling you to arrive 3-4 hours early) and then hoping the security line is fast (again I flew international and it was so very stressful to hope that I could get through security in less than an hour for an international flight). All this to say, I will NEVER fly this airline again and will NEVER allow anyone I know to book this airline if I can help it.

I will fight for this money and encourage everyone to always do the same!! Exchange contact details with other passengers on your flight and have all of you claim it back if they cause delays or cancelations! It's your right to fight for it and this airline is not making it easy but most passengers don't like this hustle after and then they end up not trying it anymore.","The airline now owes him 600€

Interesting you can buy alcohol but not water. Trying to get the attendant attention for a small cup of water, that was not chilled, took greater thsn 20 minutes. So be warned bring cold water on the flight and be prepared to wait for any service. The flight itself was turbulent but good. Landing went very smoothly.

Is Iberia airlines a discount airline now?,Bordeaux,Madrid,Europe,"Before our flight today I considered Iberia to be on par with KLM, BA or any other international airline. So when we booked for myself, my wife and 2 kids we did not expect to have to specify that we were taking bags with us. Our online booking kept freezing at payment stage so my wife called Iberia head office who proceeded to book our ticket. We did not pay discount rates for the tickets. They were equal to BA for the same distance. We also did not book last minute. Our booking was made 6 weeks before we flew. What a surprise when we arrived at the airport in Bordeaux to be told that we needed to pay 90 Euro for our 2 bags. That's 2 bags for 4 people, we were traveling light. When I asked to speak to someone representing Iberia I was told that there was noone at the airport from Iberia (it was an Iberia flight not even a code share). I asked them to call Iberia to clarity how this happened. Their response was that we must use our own phone. Now that's customer service!

I don't expect that anyone from Iberia online marketing will contact us. That is only done by the flagship carriers.

Vacation: Getting yelled at by flight attendants and having unattended luggage transported across COUNTRY lines,New York City,Zagreb,International,"If I could give this airline, 0 stars I would. My ticket was subcontracted from American Airlines to Iberia, so I was not given a choice whether or not I would like to fly on this airline, but alas I had to. I was traveling with a large group and we each had different experiences. We had called and requested a vegetarian meal through American Airlines and Iberia, when we found the ticket had been subcontracted, however, when we were on the flight, there was no vegetarian option present for us. As soon as we mentioned the issue to the flight attendant, she proceeded to yell at all 12 of us, calling us incompetent and that it was not her problem that we did not have any food. She called us liars and said that if we called, then there would a meal present for us. We I had asked for water, the flight attendant yelled and said another individual would be giving me water and when I asked the other attendant she yelled at me again-so I wasn't given water on a 7 hour flight (that's fine it's not like humans need water to live). The Iberia customer service changed our gate in Madrid and said to show up there at the time listed on our boarding pass. 6 members of our group were at the gate about 20 minutes earlier and our PARENTS had gone to the bathroom and were meeting us at the gate afterwards. The lady did not tell us to get to the gate earlier, so we made it on the flight and our parents who were still early were not able to make it. There was a minor that was traveling with us and her parents were not on the flight with us. We spoke to the people on the gate and the flight attendants and again got yelled at and forced us on the plane. My parents went to the customer support desk and the lady claimed that we lied and it was their fault they did not make it to the gate on time. Someone told us, ""you are supposed to be at the gate, not the bathroom."" So Iberia wants you to piss your pants so you can sit on their horrible flight. One of the biggest issues I had was that the luggage that our parents checked in made it to Zagreb. While this made my life easier and we did not have to deal with half of our luggage going back to JFK, there were SIX SUITCASES WHOSE OWNERS WERE NOT ON THE FLIGHT TRAVELING WITH US. This is a safety risk.I do not know who goes on vacation to be yelled at by the travel staff and then realize that there is luggage transported on this plane, when the owners are not there.

Return experience as bad as the outbound journey,Palma de Mallorca,New York City,International,"I wrote a review several days ago concerning my family's outbound experience to our vacation destination. I hoped for the best on the return trip and got much less.

First, since they unhelpfully messed up our luggage situation, I purchased a duffle bag in Mallorca to carry on things we purchased on our vacation rather than risk them in a checked back prone to loss per numerous other's experiences. It actually turned out to be unnecessary as our luggage went everywhere we went. Yet, they still managed to nearly cause us to be stranded in Madrid.

Our flight out of Mallorca departed about 20 minutes later than expected with no warning or explanation. Our layover in Madrid was only 1:25, so I was already getting concerned. But I thought heading toward the US could not be nearly as bad as heading away. I was wrong. Madrid is a massive airport that operates as if they are herding cattle. There is ZERO organization. By the time we landed, we had 1 hour to make our connection, but first, we had to sweat to death in a madly chaotic passport control line then get to another terminal that was (by signage) 24 minutes away. We were mere feet from our gate after running through the airport when we got to yet another point where Iberia had to take yet another look at our boarding passes and passports. This was not the gate mind you but a point prior to the gate. It was at this location that Iberia decided to pull my wife aside for a random pat-down, swabbing, and all that other TSA type BS which we had already gone through in Mallorca. My son and I waited at the gate for this. I asked the gate attendant when they were closing the doors. Two minutes was the answer I was given. I then asked how long that security check would take. 4-5 minutes was the answer I was given. WHAT??? Their staff absolutely don't care if they are rude or they ruin your day or your vacation. They don't care if they separate families. In the end, my wife made it and the attendant was full of BS. People still boarded the plane for at least 15 or more minutes after that point. Their employees honestly have no clue what is supposed to happen and when. NONE.

So now, I will reiterate, DO NOT FLY IBERIA if you don't have an enormous time cushion. They will stress you to the point of rage or a nervous breakdown. Second, if you can help it, do not make a connecting reservation in Madrid. The worst run international airport I have ever passed through. 

Our next stop was JFK. As old and massive as that airport is, I must say the customs lines were orderly, staff and customs agents were helpful, and yes, it is a busy airport but at no time were we ever left to feel neglected or uninformed.

Very poor customer service,Chicago,Madrid,International,"Iberia had to cancel our flight on 6/29 due to a baggage handler run into and damaging the plane.  As we left the plane we were instructed that we needed to line up at another station of O'Hare.  We tried to contact Iberia and American Airlines (our original booking airlines).  We were told by Iberia that we must get in line to re-book.  We contacted American as well, and they were willling to help but Iberia did not update their system to notify that the flight was cancelled.  We, then, got in line to re-book.  While in line, we contacted Iberia one more time after about 2 hours of waiting.  We were again told that we needed to wait in line.  We did.  During our entire time in line, no agent gave an update of the process.  When we neared the counter, a manager was standing near the front of the line.  We had been in line for about 3 hours at this time.  I asked him about the process and he informed me that they would not be re-booking us at this time and were only providing assistance to those needing hotels.  I asked him why this was not announced and he replied that it had.  I responded that this was not true and he stated that he did not need to talk to me.  When it became our turn to reach the counter, we were so close at this point we decided to wait, the manager walked over to 2 ticketing agents and held them up so they could not help us.  This not only affected us, but affected about 30-50 people behind us.  When we were finally served, they indeed told us that they could not help us that night and instructed us that we needed to report the next morning to find our new arrangements.

Very happy with Iberia Airlines,New York City,Madrid,International,"Three of us flew nonstop from JFK to Madrid. Even though we had to drive to NYC and park, the price was so much better than Baltimore.  Booking on their website wasn’t very clear about prices for seats, luggage, etc but I figured it out eventually. 

I opted for extra legroom in seat 39 and it was really nice to have. They brought us a very delicious lunch of hot pasta or chicken, salad, desert and free wine. Then 3 hours later they brought a snack of yogurt, muffin, turkey sandwich, and cookie. The overnight flight also had a great snack box even though we didn’t leave till 9pm. Unbelievable compared to US airlines who give you only crackers and pretzels!  

They provided a wheelchair for me which was such a help through two busy airports  The employees were so very gracious and kind and did not expect any tips.

Experience Somewhat Satisfactory,Miami,Lisbon,International,"It was a large aircraft with seating to left, right and row of seats in center of plane. Each seat left with a blanket and pillow - nice welcoming.  Boarding was a bit disorganized though. Stewards appeared burdened by every request made, and rarely cracked a smile food was mediocre,  however that said I dont think I ever experienced a delicious meal inside a flight -- unless of course flying first class. There were bathrooms not only in the rear of aircraft,  but in the center as well which was a plus as this was a full house. However half way into our travel they were in dire need of a clean up and tp replenishing of which never happened. I did find that where Iberia excelled was in that they allowed for more 'free' luggage than their competitors and they also kept you distracted with the many movie options available to you -- oh btw each seat having its own monitor screen for viewing. Seating upholstery appearance was clean and maintained and pilot was experienced in making it a smooth flight.

Waited on the tarmac 30 minutes, then they boarded from two different parts of the plane with no organization. People were trying to move through the aisles in both directions.

Just... OK,Lisbon,Mykonos,Europe,"Having already flown a reasonable amount of times, using a total of 6 different companies, Iberia is at the middle...
The economy class is at the level of any low cost.
No snacks provided at any of the 4 (short) flights we had.
Maybe we were unfortunate to have some turbulence at ALL the 4 flights during takeoff/landing. This I really think was a misfortune, cause Iberia is a flagship company, so I assume it was a coincidence.
But one thing is for sure, TAP is WAY better, and give you food according to the flight duration and time of day. Even at short flights you will have a snack or even dinner/lunch if it's the time for that.

New Luxury Jet Liner had style!,New York City,Madrid,International,"Iberia Airlines is the national airline of Spain and I have been flying with them for decades.
The airline has always been a high end company, which just purchased a fleet of 350-900 jets that have two super Rolls Royce jumbo engines.
The thrust at take off was powerful yet so silent it was impressive.
The interior design was absolutely beautiful!
I loved the flight attendants uniforms which were stylish.

The new luxury jets were much needed and if you travel in first and business class, the seats are very roomy.
 The economy seats sandwiched me in an 8 hour flight were a bit uncomfortable. I barely had enough room to stretch my legs but the price and sales are a bargain.
I wouldn't fly with any other airline, because the flight attendants are Spanish and I give them a 10 for professionalism, courteous and friendliness.

Other than the airport, which was a stopover on the way to Italy, the airline is great. We had a lot of leg room, decent meals, lots of friendly service. Our flight on Iberia to Rome from Madrid was shorter but just as nice. I would definitely fly Iberia again. On the way home, we flew AA which was horrible and squeezed in as many seats as possible to make a buck. Result -- uncomfortable for 9 hours. Flying Iberia was nice.

True insanity.... something out of a movie,Malaga,New York City,International,"My family and I were traveling back from Malaga to Jfk with American Airlines operated by Iberia. As we show up to the airport to check in ( online was not allowed) we stood for 1 hour at the desk while the agent tried to check the 6 of us in. I kept asking what was wrong, where I was told hold on, wait, I don’t know. Finally she says she can check all of us In but my niece can not be booked for the 2nd part of our flight from Madrid to JFK. She told me she did not know why and I would need to consult with the help desk in Madrid. Not very comforting obviously. I called American Airlines who told me to call Iberia who told me it’s Americans issue. We had to board and take off so I resolved to deal with it in Madrid. Once in Madrid ( with 1.5 hour layover) I stood in the Iberia CS line for well over 45 minutes only to be told we just missed the check in! After a nervous breakdown they agreed to give her a ticket ( hand written) and all 6 of us with a small child and carryons  were told to “RUN” to our gate. It’s a 23 minute walk to our gate. We ran the entire way and made it as the gate was closing. Drenched in sweat we boarded our plane! Hurray! The 7 hour flight wasn’t bad, the plane was clean and had a decent entertainment system. The flight crew were not  very nice and short with my children as well as myself with any question asked. I however had a very nice attendant from business class offer me some food because I have celiacs and they couldn’t accommodate my meal request. The attendants in my seating area did not care at all and didn’t offer any ideas. In addition I couldn’t purchase food either because they do not offer it. Once we landed we stood around for another hour waiting for our luggage. Guess what....It wasn’t there! Apparently it was still in Madrid! Actually 1 bag made it. The rest were still in Madrid. We did have a very nice person help us with our claim and we did get our bags a day and a half later. My Tumi suitcase was bashed in on one side but other than that, everything was accounted for.

To save space the airline uses a thinly padded seat, however they do recline generously.  The in flight entertainment systems worked well and were full of a variety of movies, TV shows and music.  I do recommend spending the extra money in order to select your seat in advance as these flights tend to sell out and even over book.  The flight attendants were moderately helpful.

Luckily we sat together thanks to some nice people's grace, but at the rear back of the plane, next to the toilets, and this is not at all what we booked for ourselves from the first place.

Awful check in experience and boarding,Madrid,Sao Paulo,International,"Iberia avoid passengers to choose seats for free during the booking process so if a passenger booking and paying for an air ticket with this company will wish to choose a seat this will need to pay extra for it. This shows very inappropriate and uncomfortable  specially for passengers traveling as a couple because if the passengers will decide not paying extra for choosing seats together Iberia will choose the seats the way they want and probably will place the couple sitting in separated seats far one from other. This has happened with me and my partner during our flight from Madrid to São Paulo this month and I had to pay extra to change the automatically chosen seats that Iberia had chosen for us placing us in different and separated seats really far one from the other. Well I’m a frequent passenger on flights and this was the first air company acting like this I fly. Usually most of Air companies allow check in and free seat choosing 24
Hours prior the flight but not Iberia even if they say they do their app and web page will not work properly sending messages for the passenger to obtain the board pass in the airport so if you don’t pay extra and you travel together someone else as a couple expect flying separated!

You get what you pay for,Mexico City,Madrid,International,"MEX to MAD is long, uncomfortable and mainly sleepless. Flying Economy is not all it’s cracked up to be. I have attempted to mitigate the raw, basic experience of our 11-hour trip from MEX to MAD by buying Exit Row seats. The trade-off for a little more leg room is the right to a stern lecture from a member of the cabin crew who is required to make sure that you understand the additional responsibilities you have taken on. You are shown how to open the door in case of emergency. You are forbidden to stow your carry-ons anywhere except the overhead locker and you have to satisfy the crew that you are in full possession of all your mental and physical capacities. Another benefit is that now, the seat in front of you is too far away for the fold-down table to be accessible so you must resort to the little fold-out thing which hides in your arm-rest. It provides an horizontal surface just big enough for the meal which will be handed out, but not quite big enough to move your arm from the metal barquette of pasta directly below to your mouth. It would be unfair to single out Iberia as the only airline delivering this kind of no-frills experience. They must all get together on a regular basis to define standard minimum comfort levels. They don’t even make money on us Eco travelers. Airlines rely on selling Business Class and above to make a profit.  

So we content ourselves with the paper-thin advantage of flying Exit Row. But to little effect. My wife even tries bedding down on the floor in front of her seat. To no avail.

Average. Functional. Nothing special. Similar to easyjet.,Paris,Madrid,Europe,"I fly a lot in airplanes. About my last flight, in business class, I have to say that the food was surprisingly nice and the attendants were ok (white calf hamburger). I enjoyed the experience. Although it’s not like business emirates or nothing similar. No luxuries. 

 If you are not flying in business, the flights depending on the route are quite average. The space is very small, so if you’re around 1,90 you won’t have any (I insist, literally) any space for your legs, so please take extra large seats. Bear this in mind! Apart from that, it’s average airlaine, nothing special. I would rather take a flight with Iberia than with Ryanair because for me Ryanair is below average. Therefore I would include this airline as usual low cost, functional and I would rate  it with a 6 over 10. No luxuries. 

Something I have learnt with experience is that the check in if done 24h before it’s for free but before you cannot do it for free, you need to pay in advance for a seat. That’s the policy of Iberia. However in the website it’s not clearly explained and several times I had to pay for choosing the seat because I was not allowed to do the check in for free since it was before the previous 24h.

No continuous liquor service.

Passing by Madrid, again worst airport... 100 people queuing up to pass the security check and only 1 policeman. When you ask people in charge they don’t care at all and do nothing about it. 
 No respect for the client. The flight is delayed but they never say it or write it anywhere, juste letting people waiting standing like Monkeys.
40 minutes later they finally say that it is with no information about it.

Terrible customer service Iberia customer service threatened to call security and stop me from boarding,Madrid,Miami,International,"I booked this trip through Expedia and the first portion was an American flight number  services by Iberia and the return flight was Iberia. It was a nightmare with the seats.  I booked  (or thought I paid and booked) seats going for both flights. I only got a confirmation email for the return from Iberia.  The run around between airlines was crazy.  I finally had an American Airlines agent that confirmed that the seat was showing on his screen all the Iberia could not see it.

The day before the flight I called again to confirm and the seats were now not showing for the first half of the flight. Expedia tried to assist and  they finally indicated that the flight got rebooked and the seats were not transferred on the new flight.  She said to show up with the receipt three hours before as neither Iberia or American were showing it. All was fine when I got there the seats miraculously appeared 

On the return flight although I had received confirmation it was a different story. I was told to go to customer service as they had no records of seats. They said that the confirmation email was not a confirmation. When I asked if they could put in writing so I can dispute later they said no.

Nothing new. What others have said.,New York City,Palma de Mallorca,International,"I'm telling my take, but this is generally similar to what others have experienced. 

First, I'll say everything was on time. That is the positive. Everything besides that was a mess. 

The flight from JFK to Madrid was on time, but the itinerary had just 1:20 layover before our connecting flight to Mallorca. The line for passport control was mass chaos. Then we had to take a train to another terminal that was 28 minutes away. Then go through airport security. We made it to the gate the minute of departure, and was told by the gate attendant, ""Gone. Nothing we can do"". There was zero chance of making that flight given the customs time and process, so I can’t fathom why it was chosen as the connection by the airline. We had to goad the location out of them to the customer service desk. We get there and there is one other couple waiting that were also in our flight having the exact same experience. After waiting about 20 minutes, they institute a take-a-number rule and proceed to try to take care of all business class customers firsts instead of the original queue order. I was not about to let that go down, and basically led a charge of the line to take us in order. They did, and we were booked on the next flight out 3 hours later. We were told our luggage would travel with us. Ha!! I wasn't sure how that was going to take place, but I tried to give the benefit of the doubt. When we arrived in Palma, our luggage was not on the carousel. Neither was that other couple's I mentioned. Luckily, they found the Iberia service desk and their luggage. We found two of our bags standing side-by-side there. As far as the third, they refused to provide any help and shooed us away. We didn’t know what to do or who to ask. So we finally made our way down to customs luggage, and by a small miracle, the third bag was circling alone on that carousel. 

We’re not leaving for another 4 days, and I’m already anxious about the return trip and luggage situations. I’m considering buying a duffel bag and shoving as much inside I can and carrying it on while leaving only my least favorite belongings in my luggage. We’ll see. I still have time to think on it. 

At least on the return, our vacation will be over and we have all of our things at home. Missing a few shorts and swim suits won’t be ruining if another mess up happens. 

This trip was a little impromptu to meet up and visit a son stationed in the military in Europe. If I had more time to plan and save, I’d make sure I flew with an airline that has at least HELPFUL customer service agents.",July 2019,"July 5, 2019",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,,,
"Longest Check-in Ever, Lost Bags, Not Even Water Free",Madrid,San Francisco,International,"Our family of four booked this June trip through Orbitz back in February, the first leg via TAP Portugal and the second through Iberia for Level Spain. The entire experience was problematic--booking through Orbitz and dealing with both of these airlines. This review deals with the return portion of our trip, and our booking experience with Orbitz.

First, on the return date of our trip, we got to the airport more than two hours early. We were flying first from Madrid to Barcelona (and the second leg was to San Francisco). We checked the information screen to see which desk number to check in for our flight and proceeded to tag our bags at the self-serve kiosk (since everyone in line had their tags). However, when we got to the portion where the tags were supposed to print, we were directed to a counter. After standing in line for about 15 minutes, we were told that for international flights, we wouldn't be able to do this. It would have been helpful to have signage or screen info to indicate this caveat. Also, despite what the info screens indicated, we should go stand in line at yet another desk to check in. So, we stood in line for about 30 minutes and when it was time to check in, we were told we needed to pay extra fees: 75€ per bag. We had four bags. After showing the agent the email from Orbitz that I obtained in February indicating there would be no fees for the first checked bag, she said she showed no bags had been paid for. Since two of our bags were carry-on size, she didn't charge for those, but did charge us 150€ for the two larger ones. By this time, we had been at the counter for about 30 minutes! Every step of check-in took several minutes. The agent kept consulting her partner at the next desk--she must have been new. It was a little after 7am when we arrived and we were hoping to have breakfast before our flight, but in the end, after 45 minutes at the check-in counter, we nearly missed our flight. They were already boarding when we arrived. Our family boarded the plane tired, hungry and frustrated. One more thing, since we got an error message online when trying to reserve our special meals, I had called Iberia to request them and was told we would have to request them at the check-in counter. Well, with all the other drama and delays, we forgot. Had we remembered, it probably would have taken more time than we had to get this agent to reserve them. So, we just ate snacks and expensive mediocre food during the longer 12-hour flight from Barcelona to San Francisco. To give you an idea of the pricing, water was 3€, snacks were anywhere from 5-7€ and coffee and tea were about 2.50€. Soda and juice were more expensive. Nothing was free--not even a cup of water. We spent about 100€ just to keep our family hydrated. We didn't purchase wi-fi, but that would have been over 20€ per person for the entire flight.That is probably par for the course for a low-cost airline, but I had no idea when I booked that this was the case. Once I saw that Iberia was running the long-haul flight, I somehow thought our experience on board would be better. Also, the flight back was freezing, more than most flights I have flown, but they sold blankets for 16€--just incredible...This, after making us wait in a sweltering stairwell  for 20 minutes, without fans or air conditioning, surrounded by frosted glass hit by the sun at a time when it was over 100 degrees F outside. I was starting to get dizzy and most passengers were sweating profusely by the time the buses came to take us to the plane to board.

We came into SFO on Saturday, June 29, around 6pm. After getting through customs, getting flagged to have our bags checked, most of the passengers had already retreived theres. We were told multiple times by SFO baggage claim staff that we should wait, that despite the screens indicating that all baggage had come through, that more bags were being brought out. So we waited, periodically checking with him, for about 20-30 minutes. After that, we went to the counter and stood in line to talk to an agent. The agent there traced all of our luggage to Madrid--it never left the airport after our lengthy and expensive check-in process. She said we would probably have them the following day, Sunday, June 30, because of other airlines with daily flights to SFO that Iberia could use to send them to us. She filed a Property Irregularity Report (PIR) and told me to call the number at the top for updates. We went home without any of our clothes, shoes, gifts or personal items, reassured that we would have them back the next day. I called the number on the PIR (for Iberia) on Monday. There was no updates.  I called Tuesday and the Iberia agent put in an urgent message to SFO for an update and said I should receive one on my phone. I did not. I called on the morning of Wednesday, July 3, and the Iberia agent I spoke to then sent a message to American Airlines, the carrier who brought the bags via Chicago to SFO. The only info I had at that point was that SFO was not confirming the arrival of the bags with Iberia, which meant that they couldn't be released to be delivered to us. So, I called SFO to see if there was someone I could talk to in the baggage claim area there. I spoke to two people, neither of which could give me a number of someone in the baggage claim area. So, I decided to wait and call later. Our bags were finally delivered that Wednesday evening. Although I am glad they weren't lost outright and it was a huge relief to get them back, it was a long and worrisome process that perhaps could have been avoided had we not had so much trouble at the initial check-in.

During this time, while trying to recover the bags, I was emailing Orbitz to get my 150€ in baggage fees refunded, as they assured me I would be able to if I simply provided the receipts, which I did. The first email I sent, they denied the refund. Then, I pressed, referencing the email in which the Orbitz agent confirmed that the first checked bag was included in the price of the ticket for each passenger. The emails came back with more requests, not acknowledging at all the fact that their own rep had assured me that this was not a charge I would have to pay. They tried to tell me that bags were not included and asked if I could provide a screenshot of the erroneous information. Who takes a screenshot of every page of a transaction online? I pushed back again and was provided with a phone number. After 45 minutes on the phone with both two reps and a supervisor--all of whom were polite, but tried to tell me I was NOT due a refund--I was finally refunded the fees. This is not what good customer service looks like, Orbitz. I share this story with everyone I know who travels. There is no way I would recommend Orbitz after this very frustrating experience! And the funny thing is, I usually book directly with the airlines if I can. This fare was so low, that I went through a third party to get it (and paid for it in other ways in the end).",June 2019,"July 5, 2019",2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0

Not worthwhile hitching a ride with Iberia,Johannesburg,Munich,International,"Booked my flights 08May Johannesburg/Madrid/Munich , return 04June 2019 Basel/Madrid/Johannesburg on Internet on their cheapest tariff. Highly recommend that this airline puts the following remark at the top of their internet Iberia booking schedule That if you book on their cheapest air fare and need your suitcase to go into the hold you have to pay a hefty extra fee !!!!!. I landed up paying twice on outgoing and return flights Euro 45 which amounted in total to over R 1600.00. So this is not a cheap tariff and this is misleading the public. 
Furthermore they cancelled my connecting flight from Basel to Madrid on the return  flight but this flight was cancelled totally of their weekly flight schedule from Mondays to Sundays , no apologies or reason for this cancellation via the internet booking. Very annoying as I had an overlay of 10 hours at Madrid airport before a ten hour flight.So another disaster with this airline. I then enquired and found out that one could book into a lounge for Euro 35 again at passenger,s expense where one could have a free lunch, dinner, coffee or sleep there if one was tired. 
So overall a very bad experience and thank god Iberia will no longer be flying into South Africa as off 30/9/2019 !

Disorganised overall though some of the stewardesses did their best to make it a reasonable experience,London,Quito,International,"A disappointing experience. The trip had four Iberia flights (London- Madrid, Madrid-Quito, Quito-Madrid and Madrid to London) [I normally fly BA but there is no BA flight to Quito and Iberia is the One World Partner]. Generally the Business Class Service (food, flatbed) is better on BA.
Iberia added some other quirks to annoy - having booked to premium long haul tickets I was surprised to find that on the Quito to Madrid leg, myself and my wife were given seats on opposite sides of the plane.
In Madrid, their handling of the final leg back to London was farcical. Our Boarding Passes (issued in Quito) said we would depart from Zone S which is near the Iberia Lounge in terminal 4S. They started displaying that the flight would leave from Zone H (which is in a different terminal!). When I asked at the desk how to get to Zone H they said no its leaving from S36. When I told them their displays were all wrong, they acknowledged it but didn't change it for 2 hours. Then they displayed S42 as we went to Board they changed it to S27. Terminal 4S in Madrid is very large so the distances between this different gates in not trivial when the flight is about to close. Then actually at the gate the queueing was disorganised resulting in passengers trying to push in.

Worst airline ever!,London,Melilla,Europe,"This has got to be the worst airline in the world. The flight from London was delayed so that gave us little time for our connection in Madrid. When we got off the flight a women instructed us to take a coach to our connecting flight. The coach took us to the the wrong terminal about an hour away. Me and my elderly mother had to catch a train back to the correct terminal, go back through passport control and go back through baggage security. By the time we reached the gate our flight had gone. We were not able to run because my mother is elderly and fragile. We spoke to the Iberia help desk who told us that it was our fault for missing the plane. They said we were lying and that there were no delays despite us arriving an hour late. They put us on standby for the next flight. We waited for hours but the flight was full. We returned to customer service who were extremely unhelpful and I suspect racist. After a heated argument they refused to speak to me, give me any information about my bags or allow me to speak to the manager. They completely ignored me. I have never been so angry in my life. They basically told me and my mother to get lost, said we were lying about the delay and that we had plenty of time to reach the gate. Therefore they were not prepared to help at all.

CONTEMPTUOUS RUDE CROOKS,La Coruna,Nice,Europe,"I got bumped off my Iberia Flight to Nice in Madrid even though I was at the boarding gate before boarding started and had a boarding pass and had paid extra for choosing a seat. I and others were connecting from an Iberia flight from Coruna which was late, so they must have sold our seats to others. But the Nice flight was also late so we were at the gate before boarding started. There was 45 minutes wait at the Iberia service counter after we got bumped, so I bought another Iberia ticket on the next flight before they were all allocated. Iberia refused to refund me the second ticket when I eventually got to the service counter where they transferred me to that same flight on my original ticket. Not at any time did any Iberia staff apologise for selling my £350 seat to someone else. They react as if their customers are just a massive inconvenience to them.

Very bad food or snacks, but as always you can save yourself from some stomach sickness by ordering a low sodium meal.

Unbelievably horrible experience,Portland,Granada,International,"Iberia Airlines, who I've traveled with regularly since my first trip to Spain as a student in 1988 has been impossible to work with. Since I missed my first outbound flight of a multi leg international round trip flight for June 30, 2019 booked through Travelocity in May, Iberia canceled my ENTIRE itinerary, outbound AND return trip that I had bought for July 11. As a result I lost the entire value of my $3,597 flight itinerary. After over 10 hours of phone calls and 2 separate Iberia reps stating that at least my return flights were still valid, Iberia refused to work with me or my booking agency at all. So I had to book another, one way flight to get to Granada in time to give my paper at an international conference costing almost $7,000 for my and my 10 year old daughter's flights, only to be told once we arrived that Iberia would NOT reissue the original return flights and had erased it from their system. The Iberia phone rep in Spain said all they could do was to sell me a 3rd flight itinerary, one way to get home after my conference for another $8,124. Seriously. So an original round trip booking for 2 passengers I had paid $3,597 for, would end up costing $18,436. 
Thank goodness Travelocity finally stepped up and gave me a $1,000 refund on original itinerary and then booked a new round trip flight for $3671, which allowed me to cancel the $8124 itinerary they had booked me with a 24 hour ""free"" cancelation policy that actually cost a 30 Euro transaction fee.",July 2019,"July 2, 2019",1.0,,,,,,,,

The worst airlines ever,Miami,Malaga,International,"Well let me start by saying that for all of you that follow my posts you know that I travel worldwide and first class thats not to say that i am trying to prove something but rather that I enjoy a level of service and I am willing to pay for it. So We travel to Costa del Sol every year and we have flown on Iberia a few times but stopped because of their terrible service and customer interactions. Their planes are always very warm, the flight attendants are not very courteous, the level of food is abysmal and they are never on time. We have continuously had to run through the Madrid airport on our retinue to catch our connecting flight to Miami. So this time we decided to give them one last try as its easy to fly Delta form JFK to AGP. So we booked “their” First/business class two R/T tickets. Well the first problem is that when war arrived at our hotel in Costa Del Sol and opened our bags our wife’s bags were rummaged throughout. Someone was looking to steak valuables fortunately she had her jewelry on her person as we don’t place it the luggage. We filed a complaint through AMEX Centurion. So now we get to return flight so the return is delayed because of alleged air traffic hold which I subsequently checked and find out was a brief hold but not the one that Iberia placed our flight out of AGP on. This made us 1 hour late to Madrid. So with no time at all and even though I use a meet and greet service who was fantastic ( Diamond Air) we had to run through the Madrid airport grab a Train and try to make it across the entire airport in under 35 minutes.  I ended up tearing my left Achilles’ tendon ruining through the airport and sure enough none of our bags made it on our plane. I know because our Diamond Air agent went and checked and texted me that our bags did not make it. So we arrive at Miami International and immediately go to the information desk because Iberia if you can believe this does not even have a baggage claim person there. They Paige him and he is set up on garbage can with his laptop and a cell phone this was absurd and ridiculous. He then proceeds to tell us that one bag made it so we wait for 45 minutes and sure enough it nor any of our bags made it. So now we leave the airport as the baggage guy set up open the garbage can tells us that our bags are due to arrive on the next flight and be delivered to us the next day, and two days later we receive only 3 out of our 4 bags. So I try every which way to find a phone number to call the baggage division of Iberia but guess what they don’t have anyone that answers a phone its got to be the worse airline for a customer that I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED. They. Have lost a set of golf clubs valued at over $4,000. I cant talk to anyone so i have no idea where they are and we are leaving again next to travel.

Worst Experience Ever!!,Milan,Madrid,Europe,"Iberia's customer service is the worst thing I've ever experienced in airline service. Iberia lost my bag 12 days ago on a direct flight from Milano to Madrid. It not only ruined my stay in Madrid (which was only for 3 days) but I flew back to Miami and I still don't know where my bag is. A couple of days later in Miami, I receive an email from Aviapartner in Milano saying they found the bag and that they were going to send it in the next available flight. Up until this point, Iberia still did not know anything about my bag. Aviaparter confirmed the bag was sent to Miami on a BA flight. Iberia then found out it was going in this flight but they could not confirm or track the bag because it was not their airline. After waiting for 24 hours of its ""arrival"" in Miami and many customer service calls in which they could not provide the location of the bag, they confirmed the bag did not go in BA flight but in an Airitaly flight that left the following day. The events repeated: I had to call customer service again and they were not able to confirm if the bag was sent or not. The customer service line was useless: it takes a lot of time to finally get to speak to a representative because it seems they want to get customer frustrated and end the call. A computer asks for the claim number which you have to repeat for about 4 to 5 times because the computer will always get a number or letter wrong.  Finally, when they decide to put you through to speak with a representative the person rushes through the call, cannot answer the questions you have and leaves you exactly at the same place you started when the call was dialed.  
Anyway, I went to the Miami International Airport to look for the bag that was coming in this Airitaly flight and for the second time in a week the bag did not make it to Miami. I called Iberia customer service again and the response was: ""we don't know where the bag is, we don't have access to Airitaly you are going to have to wait. If the airport does not find it was probably lost"". How can an airline lose a bag two times on the same trip??! The customer service lady ended the call saying: ""well these things can happen, do you have any other question?"" 
Round three: The weekend goes by and I give the customer service another call. Now they confirmed the bag is going on a BA flight. Same story: BA cannot provide me information because the claim number corresponds to Iberia. Iberia, on the other hand, does not know where the bag is because they can access BA information. Aviaparter in Milano is now not responding to my emails and calls! Its day 13 since I last saw my bag and I have no idea where it is. I've lost a ton of time every single day on this issue because I need to get it back. I have valuable things in and medicines in the bad which I need to recuperate. This has never happened to me before, customer service is clearly NOT a value in the company. I am very disappointed with this airline!!

When our boarding time came and went a few of us went up to the desk and asked if we should be boarding. One man was told yes, the sooner the better, but my husband was told no. After 10 minutes, and more generic boarding announcements that called groups but gave NO flight number or destination, I went to the desk and was told that our flight was indeed boarding. We paid the extra in advance to be able to check one suitcase each and somehow that also got us a meal on the flight. If given the option for pasta, ask what it is. We chose pasta going and coming and it was unappetizing and flavorless in both directions. We had lasagna from Boston to Barcelona and tortellini from Barcelona to Boston. The sauce was thick and yellow-orange, not the red sauce shown in the inflight booklet. The chicken in the booklet was chicken with yellow curry but what the man across from us paid for inflight was chicken tikka masala that looked and smelled delicious. The seats were very close and even at 4'10"" I felt confined. The inflight music had very few known artists or were covers of famous songs, movies were older for the most part, and other options for documentaries either did not have English subtitles or were obscure and uninteresting. The snack before landing was also curious. My husband and I were given the warm paninis, which were about the size of my palm. I had the ham and cheese. His tomato and cheese option had pesto but the staff didn't ask whether he has an allergy to nuts (thankfully he does not). The panini that was offered for sale inflight was very different, served cold and on large slices of bread with very little inside. I could see between the seats in front of me that the lady who purchased it was examining it and frowning. I am not sure why the two paninis (paid for in advance or inflight) were so very different.

I have 3 children in Spain for now 4 days with no bags. And the worst part is that no one is able to give me an update on where they are, an estimate of when they will arrive.

Unacceptable,Zurich,Madrid,Europe,"Due to work I often book flights for other passengers. Never ever have I had any kind of problem with that all over the world to pay for other peoples flights. Due to circumstances I had to rebook flight for another person at the last minute. I was not allowed to do it online as it was apparently already too late so I decided to call the customer service. Everything went fine with the rebooking process up to the moment then the operator on the phone found out that I am doing that for another person and will be paying using my credit card (which I have been doing for the last 5 years with no problem whatsoever). The lady on the phone started being very unpleasant ans rude telling all about safety regulations and laws. She basically told me that the passenger MUST pay for the flight with a credit/debit card on his name. And eapecially during a rebooking process. And that at the check in desk he might be asked to show his credit card to validate that it was him paying for the flight. This I have never heard before in all the years. In my experience it is a common thing to book and pay for other's person flight. She told me she can finish the rebooking process but she can secure that the passenger will get on the flight and will be stuck at the airport. Due to this information provided I was forced to book a completely new flight as I always did online. But still I was told that even then it is not 100% sure that the passenger will get on the plane. Absolutely unacceptable. If the flight ticket is paid for, why do you need to be checking the passenger's credit card at the airport? At the end I had to spend much more money and listen to a very annoying and highly rude operator.

Iberia is SUPER SHADY,Montreal,Paris,International,"Iberia works with the arline called Level. Watch because even if you think the flight is iberia, its actually its low cost partner «level» which is really awful (go see tripadvisor comments for only bad reviews). This was my experience:
AVOID AT ALL COST THESE TWO FRAUDULENT COMPANIES; AND ANY COMPANY OF THE ""INTERNATIONAL AIRLINES GROUP"" which includes BRITISH AIRWAYS.

I purchased an IBERIA ticket to then discover that the flight was operated by LEVEL.
The flight in question was cancelled and moved to the next day. WE LEARNED THIS AT THE AIRPORT ON THE DAY OF THE FLIGHT! I called iberia, they told me the flight was scheduled at the normal time but it was not, it was cancelled!
Per EU law, they are obliged to provide assistance: book you a room, provide transport to and from the hotel, provide food and drinks. The company did none of that, and left people, including with babies, take care of their own accomodation which will - supposidely- be reimbursed later. 
In addition, LEVEL had no official staff at the counter to help people! Only subcontractors of some kind that kept telling us to wait for the supervisor. The supervisor turned out to be another subcontractor who knew nothing about he EU regulations!

Please let me elaborate on what we liked / disliked / and think should be done:
First: as mentioned, we paid the premium to choose seats. However the equipment was changed so we wound up in a 4 seater instead of the 2 seated we had purchased. I believe we are owed a refund.
Second: your staff at JFK was speaking only Spanish, and thus several passengers had problems understanding what was being announced. The concept of 6 groups to board the plane will not work if all the people do not understand what is being requested of us. The local signage that was employed to identify the queues was a disgrace. It looked like someone’s dog had eaten it before it was deployed. Contrast this to Madrid, where the signage was quite elaborate. The staff there made every effort to be bi-lingual.
Third: the ability to check-in through an Android phone offered was not working. When asked the country of origin my option was not US, or USA, but USES. The system on multiple attempts gave me erratic choices at each attempt. In any case we were not able to check-in in advance.

As it was an early morning flught we had decided to have breakfast on the plane, which became impossible as they did not have any sandwiches available for flights originating from Düsseldorf.

As we were only staying in Madrid for one night we only needed to check one case and thought nothing more of it. We booked seats with extra room for the return flight to give us a little more comfort. On check in for our return flight back to Düsseldorf we were told that we would have to pay for our baggage and forced to pay €25.00 (after lots of discussions) for the privelege of being able to take our case back home with us. As I was on business and we experienced no financial hardship it wasnt really that much of a problem, however iberia's immoral business practice in putting their passengers in such a position is a problem and one that I throroughly disagree with.

While waiting (boarding passes in the pocket) I checked the status of my flight and it the check-in tab. No problem until boarding. My seating had been reversed to old situation and was told I changed my seats with the app. The statement that that would not make any sense, because why would I pay for a better seat and then change back to the previous one. Heated discussion followed, almost got me off the plane, but had no option to take the seat I got. The refund I could claim in Madrid; yeah sure I want to waste time on that.

Flights are very good but customer service is terrible. Lost bag and flights. 2 months later no resolution,Valencia,Madrid,Domestic,"My wife and I had tickets on Air Nostrum, Iberia's very good feeder airline from Valencia to Madrid on March 20, 2019 with separate tickets from Madrid to Tel Aviv at least 1 1/2 hours later on El Al. Both tickets were purchased with different FF miles. In Valencia, I mentioned the connecting flight which had check in in the same terminal Air Nostrum arrived in and was told by the Air Nostrum agent that we had more than enough connecting time. In Madrid, my checked bag came quickly. My wife's never came but the rather rude Iberia people would not allow us to file a claim soon enough to get to our connecting flight even after it was quickly obvious the bag was not there. When another agent allowed us to file a claim, we went to the Iberia counter in terminal 4 and found out that it was too late to check-in for our El Al flight and we missed it. I got El Al on the phone and they were willing to assign the tickets to Iberia but Iberia refused. After a while, I was given access to a phone and called Iberia Plus and booked two later flights on Iberia to Tel Aviv paying with Avios.  Having missed the initial leg of our El Al flight, El Al was going to cancel the return leg to Madrid but only after I went to management, they did not cancel.  My wife's suitcase arrived in Israel 6 days later and two days before we left via LUFTHANSA. No toiletry kit or compensation as per their policy was offered. When we got back to the US, we filed a delayed baggage and lost flight claim on March 29. Iberia promises resolution within 21 working days . As of MAy 31, there is no resolution re: the baggage delay and the lost flight compensation.  The case is listed as ""in progress"" on Iberia's site.

Very bad to be the flag carrier airline of Spain with 90 years experience!,Barcelona,Buenos Aires,International,"To make it simple:
Food: 2 out of 10 (the portions are extremely small, but this wouldn't be a problem considering probably if you are adventurous enough to eat a larger portion of what they offer you, you might well be spending your holidays sitting in a toilet. Poor, cheap, extremely unhealthy and horribly picked food choices). If you get hungry on long flight they offer you a half sandwich... but nothing else for free or eve to buy! Be ready to be very hungry! 
Service: 2 out 10 (the team is made up of people who have been working for this company since 1927 (the year it was founded) it seems! Very slow, not happy to be there, not interested in you or anything to do with your flight, just carrying on until the flight is over.)
Seats: 8 out 10 (normal seats for a plane, enough leg room)
On flight entertainment: 3 out 10 (Very poor selection of movies, barely anything new. Hope you have enough pills to sleep through the flight!) 
Check-in: 5 out 10 (long queues, very long queues. Get there early! In Barcelona only 4 were open at 9am!!!!!)

Timing is everything (If at first you don't succeed...),Madrid,Boston,International,"Earlier today I got an email with a new seat assignment (I had paid for my choice in advance). The new seat was not of the same ""quality"" location as my previous seat so I called early this am to see what my options were.

The first two representatives were completely unhelpful and pretty much refused to make any accommodation at all - suggesting I contact customer service via email (with a two week or more wait for a response).

I called back 2 hours later, and, perhaps with the shift change, I got a new representative who understood (and sympathized with) my problem completely. In very little time he changed my seat to another one of comparable value (location). I can't thank him enough - and this experience completely changed my perception of Iberia.

It never let us down.,Madrid,Budapest,Europe,"It was actually two flights. First from Athen to Madrid on the economy, and after from Madrid to Budapest on business. For this second leg, Iberian offered an irresistible deal. To upgrade our tickets to business class cost only thirty-something Euros. Even if it contradicts to our principles paying business class for such a short trip, it would have been a sin for this money to omit the offer.
Good old Iberian provided us with everything that we expected. That I would bring up against them, that the rubbish of the previous passenger was in the pocket of the back of the seat in front of me. When I mentioned it to the stewardess, she immediately removed it and apologized. Obviously, it wasn't her fault; only the cleaning staff made a lazy job. 
The seats were as they usually are on small airplanes. Three seats were for two passengers, one in the middle. Of course, they don't provide such a luxury as the Airbus A380, or  Boeing 777-300ER does, but the price of them also just a fracture of the ones mentioned above. The food was surprisingly tasty, and the red wine was a very acceptable kind. Don't judge the food from the look; it was delicious, that isn't common with airline food. Before the flight, we went to the business class lounge. It was comfortable, with available food and drinks, but nothing special.

"Baggage Lost, Broken Entertainment System and Long Delay",Chicago,Valencia,International,"I flew Iberia to spend two months of this summer in Spain.  They lost my luggage and have yet to find it, it has been two weeks now and I have contacted them many times asking on any updates.... there haven't been any. The only update was after I filed a customer complaint, that they said they would take at the most 21 business days to respond. In addition, they didn't offer any type of payment or stipend for my lost baggage even though I made it clear that I had to buy all new clothes because I do not have any here. I understand that luggage gets lost on occasion but usually airlines are willing to pay for the immediate items you need.  In addition, usually luggage is found.  I speak English and enough Spanish to ask for an English speaker when I called the company and they told me that they do not have an employee that speaks English.

Appalling Customer Service- No way to complain!,London,Asuncion,International,"Its not often I’m rendered speechless by atrocious customer service, but Iberia have managed to deliver the very worst experience I’ve had in recent years. We booked flights from London to South America, via Madrid and Sao Paulo. Our flight was meant to land in Brazil at 5.45am for an 8.25 connection. Maybe we should have thought it strange that staff in London and Madrid were unable to give us boarding cards for our final flight, but no one mentioned any problems. When we landed and disembarked around 6.15am, we were told that our connecting flight had already departed – 3 hours early. No one was able to explain why and we were forced to spend 24hours in Sao Paulo, therefore missing an important family event. I was prepared to forgive that – these things happen, I guess.
My real problems started when I tried to contact Iberia to complain about the 24 hour delay. This is the experience –

1.	Iberia have an online complaint form which doesn’t work. It takes 20 minutes to complete then crashes, flashing up a ‘technical error’ message. We tried this 4 times using phones, tablets, laptops and different browsers. Conclusion – its set up to crash so you can’t file a complaint.

2.	There is no email contact for complaints on the website. There is a customer service phone number, but this is for sales customer service. They won’t help with general complaints and claim not to have access to the complaints system. They also won’t provide an email or contact number. They did however give me a postal address in Madrid. I asked what I would need to do if I received no response to my letter and was told there is no way to follow it up. Write another letter. Then another. Then another. That’s just how it is, was what the girl told me.

3.	Iberia try to direct you to twitter. Obviously run by an agency, this is just a gatekeeper. They won’t discuss specifics or provide any contact details. They asked me to send them a DM showing the on screen message I was getting when trying to submit the complaint form. To do that they need to follow me, as they well know. But they wouldn’t. So I couldn’t send a DM. Very clever!

4.	I finally managed to use a variation of the complaint form (right at the bottom of the drop down list -other, try it if you get desperate!). I received a reply after a week which said –‘Our flight schedules are altered every time the season changes and also during certain holiday periods according to demand and the availability of take-off and landing slots at airports. Whenever this situation arises, as in your case, the changes are announced through the ticket purchase point’. 
i.e a total non -response! What does that even mean? That they can cancel flights whenever they want with impunity?? 

5. Here’s the real kicker – Most airlines are part of ADR schemes – this is an independent body who allow you to log complaints and act as a mediator in disputes. Guess what? Iberia have opted out. They aren’t a member of any scheme, so are effectively beyond the law. As far as I can tell, there is no way of holding them to account.

We were flying from Vienna to Boston via Madrid more than 3 days ago and my suitcase completely vanished. I have not heard any news about my suitcase for more than 80 hours now... They do not pick up the phone, do not answer our emails, do not provide any information whatsoever. We managed to reach them once via phone but we have been trying to call them for 3 days now, we are spending a lot of time and money on phone calls, but cannot even get to a real person.

All of my clothes, high heels, jewelry, beauty products, makeup, perfume, toiletries, electronic devices, business materials, shoes, jackets, expensive elegant dresses went missing. I have to go through all of my meetings without being able to present my business cards... Some meetings and receptions I was not even able to attend because I had to spend my time with trying to call Iberia and then trying to find an elegant dress that I can buy. Of course, it is completely impossible to buy fitting shoes, perfume, purse, elegant dresses, jacket, makeup, toiletries and everything you need for a business trip in few hours, and also, I cannot afford to buy all of these at once. Also, as I mentioned before, I do not even have the time to run around for clothes when I am supposed to be in meetings that actually matter. This conference only happens once a year.

No communication during delays/terrible crew,New York City,Malaga,International,"Apparently “the system was down” and no passengers could be checked in on any Iberia flights. We stood in line for 2 hours without one word from the airline and no crowd control. When the issue was resolved we were forced to sprint through the airport to get to the plane. Again, with no communication about whether it had been held. We just hoped. 

Then, because the first flight was late, we had to race through the Madrid airport, with no assistance & no information, get through passport control, get on the train to the other terminal, and literally run to make our flight back to NY. 

It wasn’t great, but we understand that things happen. However, when we finally stepped on the plane we found a surly, unresponsive crew, who thought my asking for water was an unforgivable imposition- the steward snarled at me when I went back to ask for some mid flight (they didn’t bother to offer it except during the meal service).

"Good flight, marred by limited food and water availability",Boston,Barcelona,International,"I've been on several transatlantic international flights. Airlines have included Turkish Air, KLM, Al Italia, and even Iberia in 2007.  These flights all provided food and beverages, including wine or beer, pillows and blankets and more--without any extra fees. On Iberia today, you get nothing. Not without paying extra. So on our 7-8 hour flight, we couldn't get food or WATER, without paying.  To add insult to injury, passengers who pre-ordered, would get food and beverages delivered promptly, while the rest of us waited and waited for basic sustenance. I was never even given the option to pre-order. The way the system is now, flight attendants have to act like as glorified waiters and waitresses--you have to flag them down if you want something to eat or drink Yes, it was a low cost flight--but I'd pay a little extra to get a little food and water on a long, international flight.",May 2019,"May 19, 2019",3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0

Of course my luggage did not arrive in JFK and then I received it 2 days later and my TSA locks were snipped open (which they shouldn't be because it is a universal TSA lock). This was not done in the airport because they would have left the standard note in the luggage. I suspect it was the third-class courier Iberia uses to distribute delayed luggage.

I checked the walker at the door of the plane and when I go to Madrid they had sent the walker to baggage claim. My luggage was checked all the way through to Rome. There was no need for me to go to baggage claim which was in another building. 

Finally got someone to assist me. However they only allow one other person in the group to assist. The other two in the group had to go on to the gate.  

We were put in a van and driven around all over the tarmac before allowing us to enter baggage claim. There was my walker. Then we found out that it was quite a hike to get to our gate. I requested that they wheel me in the wheelchair.  Then we finally got parked at some assistance area. My friend and I are trying to find our other two friends. They were searching for us. Finally we found each other and the gate had changed. We barely made it to the gate before boarding.

TERRIBLE experience,Boston,Madrid,International,"I fly about 50-60 flights a year from work and have seen/heard a lot of traveling horror stories. Sadly I never experienced one in all my travels until flying with this airline. I’m truly appalled at how horrible their customer service is and they are very determined to not give customers clear answers and information about anything. I went to Spain the 3rd week of March 2019 and our luggage somehow got lost. When I went to the Iberia customer service counter they basically told me to give them the address to the hotel I’d be at in Barcelona, the address to the hotel I’d be at in Madrid and my home address. When I asked where or when we could expect the luggage I got an “I’m not sure ma’am.” They had no clue what city the suitcases were even located in. (I also found out they had also lost about 10 other people’s luggage on my flight.) I continued my trip to Barcelona where we were spending 3 days and had to buy all new clothes, shoes and toiletries which between my friend and I was about $400 bucks. (That’s a huge chunk of unexpected spending money when on a budgeted vacation). We eventually got our luggage back 4 days later while in Madrid  but were still out of the several hundred dollars spent replace items for those days. Once I returned him to the states I immediately filed a claim with the company to get that money back. After the first email they sent requesting specific information which I sent within a couple days, I have not heard back from them. I’ve sent about 20 emails at this point and when I called customer service I was told she would make a “note” on my profile and they would call me back once they get to my claim. I explained that it’s already been a month and a half since communications first began and I’ve heard literally NOTHING from the company. Her response stayed the same and she couldn’t give me ANY details about who would call me back, when they would call, the status of my claim or even a reason I hadn’t heard back. 😡😡😡 DO NOT EVER FLY THIS AIRLINE.

Terrible airline,Barcelona,Boston,International,"I booked our flight from Barcelona to Boston through Expedia. It was not clearly explained that this flight was to be on Level, which meant you get an 8 1/2 hour flight that offers NOTHING!  We knew checked bags cost extra, but we had carryons.  What we didn’t know was that they torture people with carryons, trying to force them to pay high checked bag fees by limiting weight of carryons to 10 kilos.  
Your suitcase probably weighs 5 kilos empty, which leaves you very little to fill it. 
Then your suitcase has to fit through a tiny carryon slot, not just fit in the carryon rectangle. I helped about 5 people in front of me force theirs through.  Pissing off the check in counter folks no doubt. The check in lines were slowed by group after group having to open their suitcases to move stuff around or wear it.  It is more than annoying.  But this was only the first headache.  
The terminal and gate printed on the boarding pass given to us after the bag ordeal, was not actually correct, but there was no announcement to that effect, and no change on the airport departure board.  
Quite simply, no one knew where to go, and I saw elderly people with ambulation problems walking all over, exhausted and complaining.   We kept asking people where to go and were directed to different locations.  Then I get a text that my 71 year old wife has been selected for an extra intense security check.  I figure that’s because they were pissed off that I helped five people squeeze their bags through the slot.  
The text said to report to the boarding gate 1 1/2 hours early for this check, but that was impossible because the gate wasn’t determined yet!!!!   An airline cannot be more disorganized!   But wait... it gets worse!  Finally the gate is posted, and my wife goes for the security check, but they can’t do it because I’m not with her. Of course, that’s not what the text said.  So she has to go back and get me.  Finally the check is over, and we are allowed to board. 
But boarding is not at the gate!!!  We have to walk downstairs to a bus to be driven to a jumbo jet on the tarmac.   There are about 50 steps up to the plane.  I can’t imagine how those people with mobility problems got up there with their carryons. 
I carried my wife’s and mine.  
With all this disorganization, one had to wonder if this airline is safe. 
Finally we take off.  We had no idea that the flight would offer NOTHING on board. You paid for a cup of water!  They didn’t even ask if you wanted to buy something, you had to call them.  We spent 21 Euros for two miniscule somethings and two small drinks.  Had we known, or if Expedia explained, we would have bought something to eat and drink at the airport. 
The only reasonable thing was that the flight was on time, the landing was soft, and the seats no worse than other airlines. 
Oh, by the way.... if you want a pillow or blanket on this flight, you pay.  I’m surprised they don’t charge to use the bathroom.   Hey.... if you fly Iberia, know what you are getting into.",May 2019,"May 15, 2019",1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,,,
Discrimination at its best and bad customer service !!!,Los Angeles,Madrid,International,"Will make this as short as I can ... Flying LAX madrid with a friend, each is allowed to check in one suitcase, we asked how much it will be to check in a secound one ..and the answer was $60 . We handed the card to the representative, and she charged $100 . You can imagine how surprise we were, so we decided to take the suitcase back (anyways it was small and fits on the plain) and asked for a refund. The answer was that they can not do a refund. How can a company charge you what ever they want, not inform you a head of time and can not refund you??  We asked for a manager, ADRIANA shows up ( who knows if that's her real name, (refused to show me a name tag and refused to give me her last name ) ... claiming she is busy with another customer( offcourse as the customer servise is zero to non ) . Finally when she came to ""listen"" to me, all she was doing is talk for 5 min and when it was time to say anything she claim we are rude ! .. what .??? Lol rude ?? Didn't have the chance to explain the problem so you can solve it for me ADRIANA ... 
Police was called( totally on our side of the story ) . Untill police came ... one of the representatives sais ... "" YOU PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS A PROBLEM !"" say again ??  YOU PEOPLE ???

"Would never recommend flying, even for free",Madrid,Milan,Europe,"We were flying to Milan originally through Lufthansa, and due to flight delays, they had to re book us with Iberian.  The customer service with this airline is not just poor, it's nonexistent.  They lost our bags on arrival to Milan, which I absolutely understand is a risk of traveling.  The issue is a complete lack of communication.  They have me a phone number to contact their office at the airport, and I tried calling that number at least 50+ times over 4 days with no answer what so ever.  I called their main corporate offices, again with no answer.  I tried connecting through the Milan airport's main number, again with no answer.  We ultimately decided just to drive to the airport to see if our bags had arrived after receiving an automated email that they were supposed to have been flown in a couple of days ago.  Fortunately our bags were there, but it was incredibly frustrating and ruined the beginning of our trip.  I don't fault them for losing the luggage which happens, but they need to have some sort of communication with their customers.  For me not to be able to contact anyone at the airline for days and having to drive to the airport for an answer is ridiculous and unacceptable.  I don't understand why they even list a phone number that nobody answers.  Even if I got free tickets on this airline, I still wouldn't fly with them.

Poor and sub-standard,Porto,Madrid,Europe,"Flew from Porto to Madrid, really short flight (thankfully). As we travelled on hand luggage we arrived at the airport and went straight through security to the departures area. The incoming flight from Madrid was delayed by approx. 1 hour, which isn't much in the grand scheme of flying. Boarding was called however this was incredibly chaotic. They tried to board by group number. I was seated at the back of the aircraft but was in the last group number and one of the last to board the plane, meaning we were even more delayed as people were still in the aisles and overhead lockers - common sense would think that being boarded by a jetway, the back of the plane are first on board? This was really disorganised. 
We were stopped by an abrupt and downright rude woman at the gate who demanded my friend check in her hand luggage (mine was fine) as a lot of customers were connecting in Madrid and we were ending our journey here. The reason seemed ok and fair enough, although her manner was disgusting. When boarding the aircraft however, I noticed coats and rucksacks in the overhead lockers and not under the seat in front which annoyed me further. Other airlines (like TAP, Jet2 and BA) tag these bags and FA's will remove from the overhead lockers to make space. There was room, just again common sense did not prevail and other passengers were not told to put certain items under their seats, which would have freed up space.
Seat comfort - terrible. I'm 6'1 and thankfully this was a short 45 minute flight, as my knees dug into the hard plastic of the seat in front. I think I've had more legroom on Ryanair. 
Couldn't comment on food and drink and IFE as there was none, such a short flight. Aircraft was clean, that was the only positive, but i think that's only because its such a short flight OPO-MAD and no snacks / food / drinks were served, a longer flight may have been different.

Iberia is now even worse than United Airlines in this regard. Additionally, their on board programming is very limited indeed. Maybe 20 - 25 movie films and that’s it, well behind what airlines like British, Lufthansa or Even United offer. On top of that, the cabin crew cared less about toilets, so by mid flight it was practically impossible to use some of them.

It was a great disappointment. First, the welcome drink was a half filled plastic cup of orange juice. Then the cabin crew member overlooked me on handing out the complimentary bag and shrugged when I asked for it.
I had a bulkhead seat and had difficulty pulling out the tray section when lunch was served. The cabin crew member sniffed audibly and gave my lunch to someone on the other side of the aisle, then moved off without serving me. I asked for my lunch which was dumped on my tray without ceremony.
The food was economy, even if .served on real plates.
The crew disappeared after lunch...there was no water service and the lady next to me tried the call button in vain trying to order some.

It is only at this point that it becomes apparent my seat has been switched, to a non-aisle seat in the middle row. My mobile boarding pass has been invalidated without anyone notifying me.

Being crammed into the middle in this way, because of some detail in the fine print for my ticket, is annoying enough.

Excellent! Don't Understand Other Reviews.,Boston,Madrid,International,"I travel using points whenever I can. I have mostly used Delta, but after their point redemption hikes it has become less affordable to fly business. I use AMEX points to transfer to airlines and after seeing a bonus for Iberia I decided to check them out. I had enough points for 4 business class seats, so I booked two trips - one in April and one in August. I did this even after reading the many bad reviews of Iberia. I have read that the crew in both economy and business are very rude and inattentive. I have also read that the food is horrible and the whole experience is lacking, but I figured that as long as I got to where I was going I didn't care. I was expecting the worse.

The only issue was not realizing that we had to check in with the gate before boarding the plane. Also, when the called for the boarding of the plane they made the announcement in Spanish and asked for Priority first, but this was not  understood and everyone rushed the gate. I thought this was the beginning of the horror, but the gate agents were turning back those not in Priority, and our need to check in with the gate was not much of an issue.

Once we were on the plane we were treated as well as other business class flights. We were served a drink and able to relax. The head flight attendant spoke with each customer and explained everything in the business class seat and also provided the menu. She was pleasant and took her time with everyone. After hearing the bad reviews about customer service I was surprised to have such an attentive person.

I had no plans on eating dinner since I heard that they took a long time to serve dinner and that the food was horrible.  I was surprised again that once we got to the point where the seat belt sign was off they began meal service. Within 30 minutes were just about finished with dinner. The food was not horrible. I never think airline food, whether economy or business is fantastic. I would say the food was on par with most flights. It was better than my expectation. 

As for the seats, they are pretty typical for business. But for some reason, I found them to be a bit better than other business flights I have been on. Not sure why, but it was a comfortable flight.

So, the whole flight experience from beginning to end was great. When you take the whole flight, from the customer service, the dinner service, the seats, the flight, and the price I would say that it was an excellent experience.",April 2019,"May 4, 2019",5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

outstanding service,Madrid,Tel Aviv,International,"I write this letter after I experienced an incredible service experience in my last flight from Madrid to Tel Aviv As a journalist and as a strategic and media consultant to The President of Israel, four deputy prime ministers, and the former spokesman for the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee and the Airports Authority spokesman, you can imagine I flew a lot with many different airlines to various destinations around the world.
But this flight with IBERIA from Madrid to Tel Aviv was an exceptional one.
This flight was unique not just because of the 320-300, airbus aircraft' the awesome dinner and the efficiency of boarding. But mainly because of the staff, especially the Mrs Susana Mauri Lopez - I find it essential to write to you about this air stewardess because her conduct reflects the spirit of your flying companies, a conduct which showcases the service and brings honor and pride to the airline. Mrs. Lopez is a lighthouse when it comes to Providing service, professionalism and efficiency.
But beyond that, Mrs. Lopez. Has been blesses with notable features of human love, Ability to contain and Emotional intelligence that turns the aircraft into a pleasant enjoyment.
Luckily, I was sitting in seat 21. J near the central kitchen and could observe the work, courtesy of passengers including ""not easy"" passengers with strange demands and requests.
Mrs. Lopez immediately helped in solving all problems, with much understanding and tolerance.
The conduct of Mrs. Lopez Was not only regarding the passengers but also concerning her colleagues - Her collaboration with the whole team caused a sensation of comfort and efficiency to the whole work processes.
As someone who was the Israeli Airports Authority spokesman (including the BG airport), I'm well aware of the of the crew' but Mrs. Lopez takes he job a step forward – not just ""doing her job"" - but seeing for the needs of every traveler, including listening and containing.
Fortunately, in the short time that Mrs. Lopez Wasn't busy,  I had a chance to discuss a variety of topics and exciting horizons extenders that brought to light a bit of Mrs. Lopez's extensive education, vision and highlighted her Barcelonan environment in which she grew up and was educated.
Needless to say, that a person that his job is giving services, such as a flight attendant, expanding the fields of human touch, intelligence, beyond the areas on which it is deposited, makes the flight experience itself  intensified, and in this case of  the extraordinary flight more invaluably from any of various movies in the multimedia system.
As someone who was a journalist and, and  today, as Ombudsman, and in charge of freedom of information, I'm well aware of the difficulty in facing the ""Israeli"" customer conduct, especially at the end of the holiday season, especially regarding the collection of bags from the overhead compartments in the end of flights.
 In a world where we all often post complaints, bashing in the social media I find it essential to praise and compliment about my personal good experiences.

Excellent flight in business class,Madrid,Lima,International,"So I was very fortunate to fly from Madrid to Lima in business class, and it was Excellent! Great seating configuration with many solo seats, which are Great for solo travellers.

Food was very good, with a meat, fish and vegetarian choice for the main. Starter was maybe a bit confused with meat, cheese, salad and gazpacho on the same tray but different plates, but it was still nice.

Service and crew were excellent. Maybe my only small gripe that no drink was served until 1h30 into the flight which meant that lunch wasn't served until around 3pm - so worth having a snack before.

The Iberia lounge at Madrid was very good. Nice selection of food and drinks. Very crowded when I arrived but then emptied out.

Soon after I started reading the reviews here and our mood darkened. No reason though. Perhaps we were just lucky but our trip was smooth from start to finish. I was able to contact them on the phone a few days ahead, wait time only a minute. Online checking worked ok. We did not book the seats, but the system put us all together. Checking at Logan was quick. Boarding, a bit chaotic, but that's because the passengers acted like cattle - no respect to boarding groups. That part was much better organized in Barcelona. Plane itself - somewhat outdated, but clean. I'm 180cm tall, so there is never enough of room for me. Can't complain. Yes, you have to pay for food and even water. Well, if I can save $1k on 3 tickets, I will have 'normal' dinner at the airport, will bring my own water on board and splurge on a bottle of 18yr scotch after landing. Can't say much about lost luggage because we never check it in. Then there is the staff. Ours was very polite and helpful. So overall I'm pretty content with them and would probably use them again.

Terrible customer consideration and service for connection from Boston to Madrid and Madrid to Sevilla flights.  Iberia knew we had a connection in Madrid but put us in row 50 of 51 on 777.  Last off with a super long walk from arrival gate to air train shuttle to a different terminal. After shuttle there was a line to get into another line to go through security AGAIN after an international flight.  No airline personnel to assist getting through any of the totally disorganized chaos though there was opportunity to escort short connection passengers through the morass.  Upon arrival at the gate we were told we missed the flight and told it was not the fault of Iberia, but of the airport.  Further told that this happens “all the time” because all domestic flights leave almost simultaneously.  There were 8 connecting passengers besides us that had this happen. We were told we should complain to the airport authority!  So happens all the time and Iberia does not reschedule knowing this because it is not their fault?  No guarantee of seats on the next connecting flight because it was our responsibility to get to the gate on time!  Will not be choosing to fly on an airline that does nothing but admonish passengers to follow their rules even though acknowledging that these are regularly ignored.

Iberia presents how to abuse their own passengers!,Mexico City,Tel Aviv,International,"This is a long story about the nightmare we (family of 2 parents + 2 children) had with Iberia.
We booked Iberia flights from Tel-Aviv to Cancun (via Madrid and Mexico City) and back. All the flights had Iberia code but the last lag was operated by Interjet.
On our return, Interjet had a delay in the flight from Cancun to Mexico City. Due to this delay we missed our flight from Mexico to Madrid. But Iberia had a later flight (which we arrived 3 hours before it's departure) that we could have taken and still make to our original flight from Madrid to Tel-Aviv. Iberia, together with Interjet decided, for their own reasons, to send other passengers and gave us tickets only for the Madrid flight for the next day. We tried to argue with them that they will give us also tickets for the flight to Tel-Aviv but they insisted it's impossible and said that we'll get the these tickets tomorrow.
The next day we came to the airport and found out that we can't take the flight since there are no places in the ongoing flight to Tel-Aviv!!!
They rolled the responsibility back to Interjet and didn’t try to give us any service. They completely disavowed us!!!
They knew all the time that we could have make it to our original flight but choose to disregard this. Further than that, they knew that we won’t have places for the flight the next day to Tel-Aviv and fooled us by giving us tickets only to Madrid knowing that they won't let us board this flight. They knew all along that they will keep us waiting for 48 hours and they didn’t even care!!! They lied to us all that time.
They behaved so mean and cruel to my family and me, they've put us to so much misery, they didn't treat us like we were their passengers, they didn’t even treat us like humans.

However, I couldn't do that yet until my flight that I missed took off (which was now in 30 minutes).  They told me to come back.  When I asked if I could receive credit for the missed flight due to delays, they asked if the delay was due to an Iberian flight.  I said no and they said that there would be some credit applied, but since there were only two seats left on the flight the cost was super expensive.  Now mind you, on-line tickets that were available on that flight were the exact same price as they were quoting me ""with the applied credit.""

Horrible customer service,Zurich,Granada,Europe,"My flight is booked for June 2019 (over 1 month from now). On the website Iberia states that one can check in bicycles but that one has to call them on the phone to do the booking. I booked a cycling holiday in Granada hence I need the bike with me and logically I also want to take it back home with me. When I called Iberia I was told that there is no guarantee that I will be able to take the bike on board. I was then told that I will have to call back in 24 hours to find out if it has been recorded in the system and confirmed. Which I did. Except that it was not confirmed. I was told to call again. So I called a 3rd time. This time the flight Zürich - Granada was apparently confirmed but not the return flight. So I called a 4th time 1 week later. This time I was told about the flight Zürich - Granada that there is no guarantee that the bike can be checked in even though it shows ""confirmed"". And now there was no record at all re. the flight back even though I spoke about it with the agent in detail when I called the 1st, 2nd and 3rd time. The agent simply ignored my concerns and kept asking me if I have any other questions. - Without answering the questions that I did actually have. And again I was told to call again in 24 hours.

Even if this is eventually ""confirmed"" in the end I will have no record or proof of any confirmation and the statement of Iberia that they can not guarantee anything certainly does not instill any confidence.

The worst of the worst in customer service,Madrid,Florence,Europe,"Here is the story:
We flew from Tenerife via Madrid to Florence Italy. Tenerife fight seriously delayed, but we made the connection. Our luggage did not. Our luggage came one day later and one trolley, a brand-new carbon-fibre Samsonite of €200 was totally destroyed. We claimed for the substitution of the trolley via the dedicated website. Iberia does not have this trolley in their assortment and we we were offered a € 50 replacement which we obviously could not accept. Customer service, that's what they call it, but in reality it is a customer irritation, after an elaborate exchange indicated ann Iberia website where you can select a shop where you can exchange the damaged luggage for an identical new one. The problem was that in my town there was no such Iberia authorised shop. The nearest is 100 km away. So the solution is that you send your claim, passport copy, invoice copies of purchase etc etc etc to a PO Box in Madrid. I have done so, but no acknowledgement, no reply, no refund. I went to Iberia Messenger account and explained the problem. No solution offered, just an indication to go another website, then the same website I had already used to send the documents to Madrid, in short customer service consists of doing nothing, gives no answers, does not help and just lets you run around from one concrete unresponding wall to the next. Then when challenged the Messenger customer service line, just stopped answering.

Mediocre,Madrid,New York City,International,"Given the now widespread standard of airlines treating economy passengers as cattle/sardines, we opt to pay slightly more for “premium economy” for long flights.

Starting from boarding, when we were directed back instead of forward, then had to go against traffic like salmon going upstream to find our seats. A piece of the internal facing of the plane was missing, leaving a large space into which our smaller belongings could be lost; crew were merely doing a job displaying little interest ;  I don’t recall any one going around to see if any diners needed anything additional; during a turbulent period the pilot required that wireless devices be deactivated.

Fly Iberia without having any expectations that you'll get good service,Madrid,New York City,International,"Iberia is a safe airline which I believe is one of its last positives attributes which remained.  I have been a Platinum and Gold member with Iberia for many years and for those of you considering flying them, I suggest you consider the following issues:
1.  Service on board is average to below average as compared to other airlines, and this is true regardless whether you fly Business, Premium Economy or Economy.  
2. Long haul flights are particularly harsh for those of us who remain awake for most of the flight.  You hardly ever see any crew checking on the passengers.  After the rushed meal service, they evaporate and literally disappear.  There are few exceptions but are rare.
3.  If you are an inexperienced traveler, you're in trouble.  They will literally ignore you and any requests will be looked upon without any grace.
4.  I have been recently taking non-stop flights on American, Delta, Air Europa, BA, and Norwegian and their service and attitude are superior than what you find with Iberia.
5.  They still have more direct flights to many Central and South American cities but competition is catching up to them.
6.  I suggest you try to find cheap deals when flying Iberia, then the shock of the poor service is not as bad as if you would have paid an expensive fare.

"Disorganized, Late and Probably Dangerous...",London,Lisbon,Europe,"Find a different airline, especially if you are flying at night, or are on a schedule of any kind.

April 9,2019: Iberia London -->Madrid-->Lisbon Missed connection in Madrid due to late start out of Heathrow by the airline. We were originally supposed to hop on a 7:35 PM from Madrid to Lisbon, but got put on a 10:30 PM flight that was also delayed to 11:05 PM on the departure screen at the Madrid airport.
We asked to fly the next morning as we had already been traveling a full 27 hours from Denver, and they said we would have to pay a full fare and lose the money we already paid for the flight that was super late, so we waited for a flight we know was delayed until 11:05 PM and boarded at 11:15 PM.  
Once on the plane, we were late due an additional 90 minutes due to a computer chip needing to be replaced. 
After 90 minutes, they disembarked us and we had to walk a long way to the new gate (J56-H18) which I estimate to be about a mile. It took an additional 90 minutes to get us on the plane that had one less row than the other plane (from row 32 to row 31 in new plane). People were displaced and standing while the airplane was taxiing! How unsafe!! 
There was some kind of electrical issues with the blue lights on the passenger seats. They were blinking on and off for the duration of the flight.
While we were detained in Madrid and so much time had passed, our accommodation had closed leaving us with nowhere to stay and the Lisbon airport closes at 00 (midnight) so we were worried about getting to Lisbon and not finding a taxi or Uber and having nowhere to sleep so I asked a flight attendant (Elizabeth Suza) if she could help us understand what to do when we got to Lisbon. Her response: I have to board this plane, I don’t have time to talk to you”, I replied, “can you direct me who to talk with either here in Madrid or when we get to Lisbon? We are nervous and don’t know the language and we need to know that we can have somewhere to sleep when we get there. Who can we talk to?” She replied, “no one. There is no one to talk to”.
This raised my temperature a lot because we were being herded like cattle and treated like we were the ones inconveniencing Iberia and were too needy. I called Iberia customer support on my cell phone at around 00:06 (12:06 PM) and Laura told me that there is nothing they will do to help us and to talk to someone at the airport about it, which was impossible since we were the only people there at that hour and I had already asked an Iberia representative who told me she would do nothing.
On this new plane, our cellphones are both out of juice and we won't have a way to make any calls when we getting Lisbon - there are no power options on the plane. This is all so many events and along the way, we just needed assurance that when we got to Lisbon, we wouldn’t be stranded, but the face of Iberia customer support is just awful and void of any compassion- even when we clearly ask for help. It just seems like we are the pains in the ass and things would go better for everyone r if the employees didn’t ha r to deal with paying customers.

A 1hr 30 minute flight took us 25 minutes, the pilot was flying at a very high speed and the plane was creaking the whole time like the back of mom and dad’s 15 year old station wagon.

I found myself saying “I would rather be working” than this long and relentless 30 plus hours. This is our vacation and we had -1 days out of 9 to enjoy it, reduced now to 8 because of all the delays.

We had to pay for the 9th at our Accommodations and we didn’t even get there until the morning of the 10th.

IF YOU LIKE BEING ABUSED THEN THIS IS THE AIRLINE FOR YOU,Madrid,New York City,International,"""I am appalled and horrified at the way I was treated by your airline on my recent trip on the 19th of April 2019from Madrid to JFK. We were supposed to be passengers on flight IB 6251.

I am a frequent business class passenger, and have never been treated this way by any airline.

This was my first-time flying Iberia, and I am sorry to say, it will be my last.

My Fiancé and I were flying from Tel Aviv to Madrid to JFK in order to meet my family for the Passover holiday. While in Madrid, we arrived about 20 minutes into boarding. My fiancé, who is of Iranian descent, was chosen for “random” security. We were assured by the gate agent that the plane would wait for us. My fiance was in the security for about 15 minutes before being cleared. We went to the gate agent in order to board, and were then humiliated and berated by the agent. He would not let us board, even after we explained to him the situation He called my fiancé, a native Spanish speaker, a liar and had no sympathy even after we explained that we must make the flight for religious religions. We were met with both anti-Semitism and racism by your staff.

We were told we cannot board the flight, and that they were taking our bags off the flight. How
can your airline have time to locate our bags and remove them, but not let us on the flight?

Humiliated and dejected, we went to the ticketing agent, who made us pay 400Euros to get on
the next flight (IB 6253)! Out of desperation, we paid it, since we needed to make it in time for
the religious holiday.

I expect to be fully compensated for this extra expense I was made to pay and for the
humiliation we went through.""

We sent this letter to your customer service, who not only refused to compensate us the 400Euros but then replied that we did not experience any ""incorrect behavior"".

I did not receive my Baggage in TFN, because the person at the check-in counter in Munich messed up the booking for my baggage by sticking the wrong persons baggage tag on my bag. This meant my bag was left stranded in Madrid (where I had a layover). When arriving in TFN they told me 24h for my bags to arrive, which is normal and i was happy with that. 
Then after two days and multiple calls to a machine, the suitcase did not arrive. We managed to find a different phone number and they told us they had been at the given address twice and tried to call us, which is a lie, as we had given them two different numbers to call and none of our numbers where called. 
We then had to pick up the bag at the airport. I asked if I could get some recompensation for the time I had to wait and they told me to fill out some form on their website. I tried to do that of course, however I have never seen a more scummy website in my entire life.

Discourteous and rude,Santander,Madrid,Domestic,"I travelled from Santander to Heathrow, changing at Madrid. I had taken hand luggage of the right weight and measurements to qualify as hand baggage only & yet my small case was removed by a member of Air Iberia staff without allowing me to comment. As I was transferring to a BA flight at Madrid I had to retrieve my luggage and go through security again, which meant that it all took considerably longer than I'd anticipated - it was very fortunate that I hadn't booked on the earlier flight to London as I would definitely have missed it. Coupled with the misinformation Madrid Airport staff gave me about the gate number for my flight to London I ended up fearing I would miss my flight. Whilst queuing to board the BA flight to London a polite member of BA staff came round and asked passengers if they would be prepared to put their hand luggage in the hold as the flight was full. I said no, because I'd already had to do this once and it had delayed me considerably. 

A little later a member of Air Iberia ground staff came down the queue and just told various people including me that their cases would have to go in the hold. When I got onto the aircraft I saw many people with exactly the same size luggage and in some cases bigger on the aircraft. 

In summary, the ground staff at Santander were discourteous & gave no consideration to someone like me who was going to transfer flights at Madrid and so would be pushed for time and the Iberia ground staff at Madrid were equally rude and unhelpful.

To make matters worse Iberia cannot be contacted via email unless you are a member of their loyalty club-pathetic.

We were told that htey would put us in hotels for the night.  Atter standing in line for 7, yes 7 hours we were told that they could not find enogh rooms for the 300+ passengers.  We were given a letter that said if we could find our own rooms they would reimburse us up to 100 euros.  All we had to do was simply email the company IN SPAIN and they would magically refund our money (yeah right!).  Also since our flight was delayed overnight we could file for compensation AGAIN FROM THE AIRLINE IN SPAIN.  Of course, I filed for reimbursement for the hotel and delay and I was told that that I was doing it wrong and that you play Sherlock Holmes and try to figure out how to file a complaint on their website - not an easy task.

I'll try to be easy and make just a least of what I didn't like:
- Roma-Madrid were late about 1.5 hr, ""likely"" even the Madrid-Mexico City was a bit late so I could take the connection..
- Very poor economy service compared to other competitors, the most cheap earpods I ever seen in a long flight (after 1 hr I already had pain..)
- Little seat which was looking quite dated
- Food really noy tasty at all and no breakfast choice, only one little box with a cold sandwich and few other little things as salad.. really nothing interesting
- Last connection Mexico City-Cancun was with Interjet (bought directly from Iberia website) and discover that can't make the online check-in, can't have a boarding pass in Roma and need to do again a separete check in in Mexico City
- Bad economy service confirmed in the way back to Italy, even to have a glass of water I needed to ask twice and wait 25 min to have it..

We don’t know what to do, we are moving in a few days so really need our bags. They have not mentioned one word about compensation either so we aren’t confident they will pay for all the things we have had to buy to replace our own.

Once again, I had a very short time in transit from
Madrid to board my on going flight to Granada. 
On this occasion all the seats I would have liked to pay for were already taken so I accepted the seat allocation given free by Iberia . This is as a mistake.
When the plane landed in Madrid I had just thirty minutes to reach my gate before boarding. I wasn’t initially worried since I knew my following flight would be leaving from the same terminal with the same airline.
However, I was back in row 17 and it seemed that many of my fellow travellers seated up ahead were elderly and several had mobility problems. By the time I exited the plane I had just 10 minutes to find my gate.
The information desk lay ahead and I rushed to ask about my gate. A frosty face member of ground staff shrugged her shoulders and indicated the screen further down the terminal. 
I could not see any sign of my flight to Granada so rushed to the nearest desk manned by Iberia. After some consideration I was told to go to K59 ( I was in H) right down the far end of the terminal

Worst flight of my life!!!,Boston,Barcelona,International,Myself and two friends flew Iberia to Barcelona from Boston for a girls trip recently and I could not get on here quickly enough to warn everyone not to fly with them. They are the rudest airline I have ever flow with! They never offered any water or food to any of the guests except a select few and when we tried to ask for water on an almost 8 hour flight they acted like it was the biggest inconvenience in the world. On our flight home we had a late evening flight and the flight attendents were again some of the rudest staff I have ever encountered. The lights were kept off for the flight because of the late hour but hardly anyone could sleep toward the back of the plain because the attendents were laughing hysterically and loudly chatting the whole ride! I would rather pay a little more for a flight than deal with such a horrible unprofessional company. Save your money and avoid flying with them.,March 2019,"March 20, 2019",1.0,,,,,,,,
"First time with Iberia, may well be the last....",London,Guatemala City,International,"I'd booked an Iberia flight to Guatemala as it was offered at a competitive price compared to other airlines.  Although I hadn't flown with Iberia before, the price was definitely an attraction for me. That said, I didn't overly enjoy my experience with this airline. The only benefit being that my flight was pretty empty and I therefore had more space around me to stretch out. The pilots obviously did a great job of getting us to the destination safely and of keeping us updated on the flight progress, but I found the service from the in-flight staff insufficient and lacking.

There was poor communication around my flight, particularly with the connecting flight.  On board, the staff were pretty abrupt and unfriendly, there was an evident language barrier, and drinks were only offered 2-3 times on an 11 hour flight.  The in-flight food was also bland and tasteless. I wasnt impressed with the level of care that Iberia provided to their customers, and this would likely influence my choice of airline again in future.",March 2019,"March 20, 2019",3.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0

"No recompense for canceled flight and ruined travel plans. Stingy, terrible customer service.",Los Angeles,Madrid,International,"My flight to Madrid was cancelled an hour before departure time because the incoming plane got into a minor accident with another plane while taxiing to the gate. Iberia offered hotel/meal vouchers for all passengers, but after waiting in line for 2 hours, and estimating I’d have to wait at least 2 hours more, I decided to take a Lyft home after being at the airport for 6 hours. I got an email saying my flight was rescheduled for next day but if I want another flight option I can call. I called because my new flight added more than 6 hrs to my travel time and my canceled flight was direct. But of course there’s a long wait, everyone on my canceled flight was probably calling Iberia. My rescheduled flight would depart the next morning and I’d need to return to the airport in a few hours, so I decided to just go to bed and take the new flight hoping I could call Iberia from Spain and change my return flight. Nope! Iberia revoked my option to make changes to my itinerary because I had accepted the outgoing flight. I’d have to pay $275 euro just to change my flight. In the end, Iberia offered nothing as a courtesy for my having lost a day in Spain, added travel time, no reimbursement for my Lyft ride home home and back to the airport and nothing for my preset travel plans in Spain that were compromised as a result of all this.

Iberia Airline's customer service is a joke.

I called Iberia about the +$25.01, they said it’s for booking my flight on the phone. I was NOT informed of this, if I knew I would’ve booked it online for free! Rep said an English-fluent manager needs to listen to my original booking call to confirm that I was not informed of the $25 fee. I called Iberia at least 10 times within a 1month period trying to resolve this. Each time I called they said I need to call back when an English-speaking manager is there, or they promised they would call me after they review my case. To make a long story short, in the end
Iberia told me that my claim was false, would not let me see a transcript of the original call, made no apologies and said there’s nothing more they can do. I then asked him if the records show what date my call was listened to by the manager and when this judgment was made. He said TODAY. Though I’ve been calling Iberia about this for a month, no one dealt with my case until today, after all their promises of someone getting back to me weeks ago. Their customer service is a joke.

I'd rather pay more than to fly with Iberia again,Manchester,Mexico City,International,"My last flight with Iberia was back in December 2017. My wife and I were going to Mexico from Manchester. The only two staffs at the checking struggled to check-in everyone and there was still a long queue when it was time to board. The fact that one of the two staffs had to leave to go and do the boarding didn't help the matter. At the end about 30-40 passengers were denied boarding as the flight had to leave. This was already quite poor from Iberia, but that's how they handled this situation after that made me swear to myself I will never fly with them again.
They left us 6 hours in the terminal without any information and the staff were actually quite rude with an attitude of ""well that's how it is"". A bit before midnight, they told us they will transport us to an hotel and re-book us on other flights. The hotel was 1hr away. I actually live much closer but they told us if we go home they won't contact us with the new flight details. We arrived at the hotel around 1am, and they woke us up at 5am telling us we had to go back to the airport to take our flights. I can even imagine how hard it must have been for the ones with young childrens.
Once at the airport they gave everyone their new flight details and ours were only the day after !
We were treated like cattle, lost two days of holidays and on top of that they refused to pay us any compensation. Claiming compensation through third party company didn’t help either as the original flight (for those who managed to get on it) did arrive on time.

Then a steward went in and was banging at the sink, left the door open so all around were woken up. Crew were in and out of their locker above my head, no chance of sleeping. There was a meal an hour into the flight which was disgusting and then nothing. If you wanted a drink you went to the galley and crew pointed at the water for you to help yourself. No drinks offered to you. Don’t know where crew went, the one in the galley was reading the paper and there seemed to be a lot of what I class as ‘bed hair’ when you eventually saw crew dishing out ‘breakfast’ over 11 hours into the flight.

I had to sit in the middle for one of the flights even though I stayed up all night waiting to check in as early as possible. The flight was late because the organisation was horrible. Before the boarding, they asked almost half of the passengers to go to the desk one by one.. Something that only Iberia does! Before our flight, an extremely rude lady yelling at everyone was taking our hand luggage to be put as hold luggage because there were no space even though not even half of the people could put their hand luggage on the plane. Well, maybe all the crew were carrying 1 million suitcases so there was no space for us. Then Iberia being Iberia started selling food instead of giving food as a normal airline and not a low-cost airline.

An incompetent and insensitive airline,Los Angeles,Tenerife,International,"This is absolutely the worst airline I've flown in my entire life. Our baggage -- there were 3 of us, including my wife and my son -- didn't arrive in Tenerife; it was delayed by 24 hours.  Unlike other airlines, which at least have the courtesy of delivering the luggage to one's hotel or wherever one is staying, the airline requires you to come back to the airport to pick up your luggage.  If you're on vacation, you can waste a few hours doing all this.  On the way back to LA, the connection time is 1 hour in Madrid, and they assured me that would be sufficient and that their flight from Tenerife is always on time.  It left 30 minutes late and I had to run for 25 minutes at the terminal to catch the connection.  Once again, the luggage in LA did not arrive.  But what is worse is the cheek and arrogance of this airline.  As our luggage didn't arrive in Tenerife, and it was a bit cold and we had no spare clothes, the three of us had to buy clothing and we spent 200 Euros.  When I filed a complaint, after a huge number of hassles, their office in New York after various email exchanges and me having to send all kinds of documentation promised to reimburse us 50 Euros, to which of course I objected in the strongest terms as an insulting and wholly inadequate offer.

TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,Madrid,New York City,International,"Where to even begin? We have flown them now twice. Once from Heathrow to Madrid and again from Madrid to JFK. On the Heathrow to Madrid leg: there was no air conditioning. Like at all. Apparently this happens frequently. I had to strip my infant down to just his diaper since we was sweating profusely. 

Madrid to JFK: They changed the plane out at the last minute so it means that me (and other passengers) who had paid to pick there seats or even pay for business class was just thrown around a plane at random. Still traveling with an infant, I was put far away from my husband, and not in the seat that I had paid for specifically to have a baby cot. I took this as an inconvenience and attempted to move past it. When we arrived in JFK I had discovered they had lost my infants car seat. Still unsure where it is, and neither do they. Car seats are not cheap! We went to the baggage area to file our claim and figure our how to move forward. This is where the fun begins. The RUDE man sitting behind the counter carried on his conversation with his friend until he acknowledged us. He then acted like we were inconveniencing HIM by even having a problem. He rolled his eyes a few times, and banged on his computer as if to pretend he was working hard to find it. I wish I was exaggerating. He then told me they forgot to put in the plane. I was given a claim and a tracking number, and was dismissed. Obviously, I cannot leave the airport with out a car seat since that would be ILLEGAL. I asked if they did, and he proceeded to go into the back room. He came back and said they don't, and that there was nothing they could do. I asked for a manager, and he said I can walk to find one. NO. I SHOULD NOT BE THE ONE TO FIND A MANAGER, YOU SHOULD HAVE FOUND ONE. Now he is even more inconvenienced. 

Graciously, Alaska airways (counter next to him), brought us a brand new car seat out of a box and offered it to us. We were releived. British Airways (who is Iberia's partner) was next to them, and after a manager finally got involved, gave us one of theirs. 

*side note: the Alaska Airlines car seat was a bit to small for him due to his weight, but we woukd have totally dealt with that*

British Airways showed us there plethora of car seats in the same room where this Iberia airlines man said there was none. We also asked him why he couldn't ask his partner airline to use one of theirs. His response was ""well you can"" with another eye roll. The Iberia manager gave us one of the BA car seats and said that it was not a common practice. BA also explicitly said, in front of Iberia management and all, that they had ""never heard of an airline not having back up car seats for when something like this happens."" 

In conclusion (I apologize for the length), Iberia's lack of general customer service was scathing. If I could give this airline no stars, I would.

Service was terrible,Barcelona,San Francisco,International,"If you're just looking for an airline to get you from one place to the next and not expecting anything more, then it probably won't matter. But if you're looking into an airline expecting some level of customer service, then don't bother. One red flag for us was that it was hard to find out what our flight included (i.e. refreshments, meals), we had been checking on the website with our booking info, but was unable to check any of that even until the day of the flight. And turns out that several others had the same problem and asked the flight attendants, but depending on who you asked, either they themselves didn't know the answer either, or said that you had to take an extra step when you booked your flights to purchase any refreshments or meals-- and a lot of us don't even remember seeing this option. My ticket didn't include meals, so I ended up ordering some food, and the attendant said he'd be back in 15 min after it warms up. I normally don't like to be pushy, so I waited for 15 min and gave it another 10 before calling again to check the status of my meal. A different attendant came and before I even spoke, she rudely said, ""your food is warming up, it takes 20 minutes, so be patient,"" and just left. As soon as she left, another attendant came and tossed my food where my tray is without saying anything. It was definitely not the nicest experience I've had flying compared to any other airline. 
Also, in the middle of the flight at one point, the airline made an announcement saying that they don't want to answer any more call lights, and if passengers needed anything, they are to physically go find a cabin staff to make your requests.

First experience with Iberia and it was ok,Santiago,Madrid,International,"The aircraft for this route was an A340-600, at full capacity, totally booked. The flight departed just in time as scheduled. I thought it was going to be a painful experience but even though the Economy Class seats are commonly uncomfortable this time a had a comfy 12hrs flight. The service on board was very good, the cabin crew very friendly and helpful. Good IFE on board and films. The only thing I didn't like was during the online check-in, I wanted to change the seat on the same class and they wanted to charge $17 for that change, it's ridiculous, probably a class upgrade or an emergency exit seat would require a charge, but not a seat with the same proportions on the same class... come on!",February 2019,"March 7, 2019",4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0

Crappiest Airline in the world,London,Havana,International,"We check in for our Iberia flight to Madrid connecting to Havana to join our cruise ship on 12 Feb. Firstly the airline crappy system failed and we were not able to check in online got to airport early 7am to check in and was told we have to check in our hand luggage too (free of charge ...Big Deal) why? Because they are using the smallest and most dilapidated aircraft. The aircraft did not take off the hydraulics broke down I am surprise the wing did not fall apart too. We return to the terminal waiting for news The Iberia/BA staff do not have a clue what to do. Finally at 7pm we insisted on flying to Madrid to catch another connecting flight the next day to Havana so we won’t miss our entire cruise. Meanwhile we insisted our bags be sent to Madrid to join us on the next flight to Havana which the airline staff assured us this is done we were told to book our own hotel in Madrid by the gate staff which is a lie. We booked our own hotel but when we arrive in Madrid past midnight we had no luggage not even hand luggage. We had to pay for the hotel we did not use. We flew to Havana the next date and got into the cruise ship with 5 minutes to spare and No Luggage. For future travellers PLEASE DO NOT CHECK IN YOUR HAND LUGGAGE INSIST THAT THERE IS VITAL MEDICATION IN THE HAND LUGGAGE and you have to carry it with you. Throughout the entire 2 weeks cruise we survive on the minimum clothes 1 t shirt provided by the cruise ship and a set of underwear, Not able to buy any clothes onboard or in Havana ....sizes too big.We are home 5 days now days still no luggage.tried calling iberia daily but no answer.

Ghastly experience,Montevideo,London,International,"Having travelled regularly to Uruguay for the last 30+ years ,and there being very few airlines to choose from, I have flown with Iberia many times. In general I have found that when things go smoothly staff are polite and helpful. When things so wrong ,which they often do,staff become totally unprofessional barking and snapping at clients who dare to ask for information.
On flying to Madrid for a connecting flight in Dec. from Heathrow, at the very last moment as passengers were queuing to board ,the flight was suddenly cancelled. Utter chaos  resulted  as iberia staff were totally ill equipped to organise alternative flights for everyone including those like us who had connecting flights.
On return this week the wrong terminal was on the flight board at Madrid , resulting in several people waiting at the wrong terminal and gate, An employee turned up and was frantically typing on the computer.She was very aggressive to a few who dared to ask what was happening.Eventually we were taken on a long bus ride to the correct terminal and gate to the awaiting plane now nearly full. After a 3 month stay in Uruguay our handluggage contained items too essential or of value e.g. documents, medicines, jewellery and expensive equipment to go in the hold.It was extremely stressful having to persuade an employee and then cabin staff of this, who were insisting there was no room.Eventually adequate room was found on board. We had the same thing happen last year.On reading of loss and theft of hand luggage which is refused at the last minute to go on board, I am glad that we refused to allow this. Both times this happened to us there was in fact room on board.After a long overnight flight this was extremely stressful and indeed left me in tears.
I conclude that Iberia is very ""hit and miss"" and staff seem totally untrained to treat clients appropriately.

We had an A330 outbound and return; I enjoyed the economy seating configuration of 2-aisle-4-aisle-2 seating, so my friend and I had our own space near a window, but the seats were thin and not very comfortable. The outbound crew was extremely stiff and unfriendly. The movie selections were fine, the meals provided were filling and flavorful.  I previously flew to Barcelona on an American Airlines plane, so I don’t know why I was placed on Iberia to head to Madrid (yes, I realize MAD is a hub, but I saw an American plane at the terminal, so AA flies there).

The worst Airline,Athens,Washington DC,International,"During boarding time, Iberia forced us to put our carry-on luggage in the airplane and not the overhead compartments because they had filled up. We were in the last zone to board the plane. When we got home, $2,039.16 worth of electronics, accessories and other belongings of mine and my family's were stolen. In addition to this sum, I had also paid 180 euros for the stolen glasses and 280 euros for the sunglasses to have them prescriptioned in Greece before I left. However, I cannot provide a receipt for the repairs because in Greece, they do not keep receipts and credit cards are not used, so everything is paid by cash.

I would greatly appreciate it if my stolen items could be refunded to me, since Iberia has shown time after time such poor professionalism and no care for their customers. I have already made a claim/complaint on the website (the reference number is P20180829-01022152). Iberia has refused to compensate me, and it is unacceptable and disgraceful that they are not willing to refund me for something that the airline was responsible for.

Good airline but awful crew,Havana,Madrid,International,"Iberia is a pretty decent airline with modern planes and good pilots. The ground staff is quite pleasant but the real no-no area is the flight crew. Me and my husband flew from Havana to Madrid on business class and we are sad to say the air hostesses should be dismissed as they were short, border line rude, unhelpful and very dismissive. In case this comment is seen by Iberia I will add we took the 23:25h flight from Havana Feb 6th 2019 and the only pleasant member of the crew was Paulina Moreno, the other two were absolutely awful. Their dismissive, annoyed attitude was a constant throughout the flight and turned what should have been a pleasant (and terribly expensive) experience into a miserable one. Some examples? One of the hostesses rolled her eyes and literally grunted at me when I asked her to please verify the plug as my phone wasn’t charging (it turned out the plug wasn’t working) I asked whether she could try the seat closer to the window only to get a very annoyed “have you tried your partner’s seat?” As it turned out my husband’s plug was ok but making that remark meant she didn’t have to actually do anything (I passed the phone over to my husband opposed to her having to try another plug) At dinner, they made mistakes on both of our choices but when we pointed it out to them they got annoyed, didn’t say anything but rolled their eyes up again and marched away as if it was far too much trouble to attend to us. Before we landed, breakfast was served but my husband was sleeping. He woke up about half an hour later and asked the hostess whether he could still have his breakfast or was it too late. She looked at him furiously (I am not joking!) and replied a dry “so, so” so we assumed she would check. She came back and literally dumped the breakfast tray on his table, said nothing and marched away. I had my breakfast at the right time (thankfully!) but there was turbulence so I held on to my tray and couldn’t eat until it got better. The air hostess came to collect the tray shortly after, she storms towards me and aks in a very sharp tone “are you finished?” I had my mouth full and she could see the breakfast literally intact so it was idiotic of her to ask such a question. After I managed to swallow my piece of toast I said “no” and she rolled her eyes and marched away furiously. I can only get to the conclusion staff rolling their eyes, being border line rude and marching away are a constante amongst the crew which is TOTALLY unacceptable! I wish I had made a note of the names of the two air hostesses who were in charge of business class but sadly I didn’t. Paulina Moreno, the pleasant member of staff unfortunately did not serve us throughout the flight but was terribly nice when I spoke to her before landing. For Iberia, if they see this and if they care the two ladies who “assisted” us were terrible and the worse of the two was the one who had a darker hair colour, she should be fired, to be frank. I will add I’ve traveled with Iberia from Madrid to Mexico City (business class) January 1st and the crew wasn’t friendly and helpful either although not to the degree shown on the Havana/Madrid flight.

Not good enough,Lisbon,Havana,International,"We were flying with Iberia first from Lisbon to Madrid and then from Madrid to Havana and back. The boarding was chaotic. Although divided in groups people from the same group were allowed to go before those who had been waiting in line- without any reason. 
On the entire flights no staff member managed a little friendly smile. 
Sitting in the wing area, there is not enough space for the allowed hand luggage. The seats are allowed to be lowered to the extent that if the person in front of you does it abrupt it will hurt your legs, and the persons head will land nearly on your lap. The leg room is very small indeed. When we asked the stewardess about this, she said that this was the condition on this flight and would we shut up. 
The pocket in front of us was full of items from the last flight meal.
The food was meager and dry. 
On the way back from Madrid to Lisbon the last abt 15 passengers were rushed out of the plains boarding area again to give the allowed hand luggage back to be kept in the hold, as there would not be space in the cabin. This was done very brute. On the other hand many passengers had boarded with much larger hand luggage than allowed. Why not check this beforehand and take this to the hold, instead of harassing the people who stick to the rules.

Plenty of legroom (I am 6’3”), great entertainment system with noise cancelling headphones, very attentive flight crew. There was always someone nearby if I needed anything to eat or drink.

When I explained that no one answered the US number they just stated ""SORRY"".  After several hours on hold I was told it would cost $6,000 to change the flight that I originally only paid $1000  As I was on hold I searched for flights online and they were pricing out at around $800.  When I explained this to the agent they laughed and said no it's $6,000 how would you like to pay?  I was so frustrated I cancelled my trip.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and was told they did not have one.  I wanted a credit for my $1,000 minus the $150 change fee but was told they do not issue credit like all other airlines that I have ever had to make a change on.  In the end I lost my entire $1000.

"Worst customer service ever, online or phone contact difficult to impossible",Munich,Madrid,Europe,"We were sitting in the plane for 3.5 hours at Munich airport without anything moving. The reason was that Iberia failed to get de-icing for the plane, although weather conditions were not severe, the airport remained fully operational and planes were taking off and arriving around us permanently. 
We were offered a cup of water at the very beginning of the waiting time. As you can imagine, this is an unsatisfying situation without having any information.

After arriving late, a refund according to EU regulations should not have been anything like a problem, regulations are unambiguous there. 

So I filled an online form, which was difficult to find. Entered a painful online form (you have to enter every digit of your phone number from a drop-down instead of typing it and the like). You are randomly redirected to Spanish-only sites intermittently and receive page errors. Got no confirmation email or anything similar after submitting. 
Phoned the company after 3 weeks. Reaching someone halfway responsible took about an hour. They could not find my form. Also, they could not provide any contact details, phone or mail, of the customer service department. So, there is no other way of contact than to fill online forms. 

So I filled another painful form, this time receiving a confirmation mail. After some 2 weeks, a standard mail response arrived. It read ""we experience outside difficulties everyday, we are sorry if this caused inconveniences to you."" Not a single reference to my complaint. 
I would have liked to respond to that, however the mail was sent from a no-reply address. So again, there is no other way than to fill another online form, entering and explaining all the details. 
So far I have not received any compensation or reply.

My husband and son flew to Germany from Chicago for his 16th birthday trip. Bought tickets through american, realized flight there was with British Airway and flight back was Iberia. British was wonderful!! Iberia awful!
1. My son is a junior and for some reason they could not handle the booking with similar names, so my husband could not check in or pay for the cheaper baggage options or pick seats. 
2. They lost 2,000 dollars worth of snowboard equipment! When I tried to contact customer service, I was hung up on 11 times. I could not get to a person and recording kept telling me to look online, however online just read pending. Still have not recovered items.
3. Plane was small, seats were tight and cramped. Can usually deal with that since low budget, but the lost baggage experience was awful. 
4. Customer service was awful and i was concerned that my husband and son would not get home considering the online customer service representatives reminded me of calling a telemarketing scam.

Amazing Iberia,Madrid,Rio de Janeiro,International,"I have just had one of the most memorable trips of a lifetime thanks to Iberia.

You may have heard about the 90,000 Avios promo last year which meant that for around £400 spending have just flown return in Business from Madrid to Rio, one of the most amazing places I have been to for sure!

My trip included access to lounges in both directions and in arriving back at Madrid which was truly fantastic.

The plane was fresh and very clean, including the loos.

Entertainment system state of the art stuff with loads of new movies to choose from.

The seat I think is the same as the British Airways First class seat and I had 1C which had so much space it was lovely and relaxing.

I wondered if they would bump me to a lower class but no they honoured the seat both ways.

Grub was as expected and some nice Cava to kick the whole thing off!

Honestly, Iberia, you have giving me a trip that I will remember for the rest of my life and not just because of the amazing amazing amazing deal but also the lovely staff, lovely lounges, lovely bubbles and extremely comfortable and efficient journey!

WORST AIRLINE BOOKING EXPERIENCE EVER,Canton of Geneva,Madrid,Europe,"WARNING: long review explaining why you should NEVER FLY IBERIA

I consider myself well traveled and have booked flights on many different airlines.  Never have I gotten a confirmation and charge on my bank card without getting the tickets I paid for.... until I tried to book with Iberia. Absolutely the worst website and booking process I've ever had. I CAN'T believe this airline is still in business.
I booked two tickets roughly 2 weeks before travel for a reasonable price. After the initial booking I had to go back to the website to request a confirmation email. The email said ""processing purchase"" implying that I had chosen the option to purchase the tickets and they were processing said purchase. Later that day I had checked my online bank statement, confirming that they had taken the money from my account. 
We arrive to the Geneva airport and go to check-in only to find out that it was in fact not confirmed. Even though I showed confirmation email AND my bank statement showing the charge, we could not get out tickets and have to purchase new, much more expensive tickets.
Ended up switching to easyjet to make our connection and avoid the hassle of this awful airline.",February 2019,"February 13, 2019",1.0,,,,,,,,
I wish I could give 0 points!,Venice,Porto,Europe,"We bought a flight for 2 people from Venice to Madrid and then Madrid to Porto. Iberia separated us, even though there where free places next to each one of us.

Boarding,Porto,Madrid,Europe,"The actual way of boarding passenger is chaotic, suggest some Iberia managers to try the experience of boarding following thw actual instructions given at the gate.

NOT A GOOD EXPERIENCE!,Madrid,Quito,International,"For a world class airline,  this flight was a joke.  My husband and I had indicated earlier that he was allergic to garlic and I am vegetarian.  For dinner, this was completely ignored and  the cabin crew tried to laugh off the problem, then served my husband with a plate olives and I had a salad.  At no time was there any acknowledgement of there being a problem which we had raised with the head office before flying.  To date there has been no apology but it has left us feeling that we will not fly Iberia anywhere again.

My Puppy is still left in UK,London,Barcelona,Europe,"We live in Switzerland and I was traveling from Switzerland to London to Barcelona. Before bringing my dog I called Iberia to check that I could fly my dog in hold from London to Barcelona. They confirmed I could and I also had a supervisor confirm this, since I know UK are tricky with traveling with Pets.
3 days before traveling I booked our trip. We had to go via Madrid because of our puppy, but that was ok. I had my dog confirmed in hold, this took 3 hours waiting because a supervisor had to confirm it. I got a phone call and also a mail with the confirmation of our dog in hold. At the checkin we are told they can not handle pet in hold, Iberia does not have a licens for this. And we were not the first ones. The only way to get my dog into spain is via cargo. This will take 2 weeks and cost 1.200 GBP. WE had a friend picking up our puppy and pur her into kennel. Now Iberia refuses to reimburse my costs for cargo and the kennel. When I ask to talk with a supervisor, in a polite way, I have not yelled once, they hung up. I called again, this time they say that their licens must have expired from that I made the booking to the day I travelled. When I asked what date it had expired, since I booked the flight on Saturday and was going to fly on monday, the second person hang up on me. I have never ever had a worse customer service to deal with. And I still don't have my darling puppy Joy with me.

There are 65 lines at customs to enter and only three were staffed.  I spent an hour and a half clearing customs coming in.  Then I had to change terminals for my continued flight to Denver.  The Chicago shuttle bus system between terminals is a joke, slow, crowded and inadequate signage.  Clearing security to get back into the new terminal was a nightmare.

Iberia - avoid if possible,Santiago,London,International,"Three of us booked flights Santiago - London Heathrow with Iberia via Madrid. On the outbound flight from London flights were delayed to final destination by just over 21 hours. On the return flight from Santiago flights were delayed to final destination by nearly 25 hours. Hotel accommodation provided in Madrid was equivalent to 2 star and no transport provided. Accomodation was inappropriately on a shared room basis. No information was available about anything at all and to be fair none of the staff seemed to be informed about much at all. At one point the service desk staff gathered up all the paperwork and ran beyond the security barrier so they didn't have to respond to the huge number of people who wanted to know what was going on. Once on the plane both to and from Santiago, onboard flight attendance was poor. Toilet paper ran out quickly, toilets were dirty. Refreshments were not available as advertised. Food was poor quality. Flight attendants appeared more intent on reading their newspapers in deckchairs in the galley than supplying minimal service on the long journey. Advised that some form of compensation may be available for the very significant delays, we have spent many hours attempting to submit claims online via Iberia's website all of which have been inconclusive because the format does not recognise flights that have been cancelled and changed to other flights on outbound and incoming journeys. There is no other means of making contact. This airline should only continue to sell tickets to passengers who accept minimal customer service levels and don't have time to look around for the cheaper tickets that are available with other airlines who do actually provide a better service - Air France, KLM, LATAM for example.

Due to a delay at Passport control at the Madrid airport, we missed our connection to Casablanca. We spent several hours going to many desks in the  airport, and no one was willing to reticket us.

Here are some of the responses:

300 euro per ticket to change the tickets, but even when I agreed, no one was willing to take the money and print new boarding cards; 
2000 euro per ticket for a new reservation on Royal Air Maroc;
Iberia desk said the were unable to do anything since the tickets were not purchased through them;
AA Connections rep told us to leave the desk since they were only in charge of  US connections;
Another Iberia rep told us to leave the airport, then come back in;
We were asked if we would like to go to other airlines to compare prices on a new flight MAD-CMN;
I phoned AA twice while in the Madrid airport, at Iberia's insistence, and was disconnected both times. 

Finally, Pilar from American Airlines escorted us to an Iberia Air desk and put her supervisor on the phone to the rep who then printed our new boarding passes.
 
Then our luggage was left behind in Madrid. At no time, were we offered an emergency toothbrush etc. As a result of our delay, we missed our free airport transfer and had to take a cab to our hotel. We spent the next day, phoning to find out the status of our luggage, and then had to travel to and from the airport to collect the bags, when they were located.

terrible customer service,Munich,Buenos Aires,International,"We recently had 2 flights with Iberia for the first time - and it will be our last. I actually never write negative reviews but the customer service is so bad, that there is no one to contact. I hope other travellers will benefit from my review.

On BOTH 12 hour flights, beverages stopped being served a few hours into the flight. We were seated near the galley so we could see what was going on. Most of the plane was going up to the stewardess seated in the galley to ask for drinks and they either were told ""no"" or ""go sit down"" - in the rudest tone imageinable. How can you not serve drinks on a 12 hour flight? And this happened on BOTH FLIGHTS. 

On the flight back, the drinks were served only RELUCTANTLY and then 5 hours into the flight, everyone was told they were ""out"". But for breakfast, the drinks magically re-appeared the drink and food cart was FULL. And what happened next really angered me : AFTER breakfast service the stewardesses were pouring ALL the drinks down the toilet (!) to prepare for landing

Wouldn't it have more sense to have these drinks available on a 12 hour flight instead of telling people in a rude tone to ""sit down""

On our return flight we were prepared, we came with our own food and drinks. 
By the way, the food is atrocious - 
But we didn't know about this on our 1st flight and were literally dehydrated when we got to BsAs.

This is absolutely unacceptable on a 12 hour flight.

Aside from this, the steward/esses were all extremely unfriendly, the seats uncomfortable, the food was terrible, th bathrooms are tiny (oh yeah, and when the toilet paper runs out its out!), the plane was filthy...

On a positive note, the Iberia lounge at Madrid airport was very nice indeed - it was spacious, modern, airy and served a good selection of snacks and drinks.  However, the ground staff were perfunctory at best in their interactions with the awaiting passengers.  This theme continued onto the flight itself where the staff were surly and grumpy.  The captain/first officer did not speak to passengers at all during the 14.5 hour flight (not even the typical welcome on board, weather at destination, warnings about turbulence, etc. – the only time we heard him speak was to instruct crew to take seats for landing and take-off).    The food was not good at all and the movie choice was terrible for international travellers.  Except for the privilege of having more leg room and a flat seat to sleep (for which I am truly grateful on such a long flight) the service was akin to the worst you can find on a budget airline staffed by unmotivated and unhappy staff.  Thank goodness I flew home with BA – the difference between the two services was marked.  BA was five star in every respect.  Just wonderful.   Once again – another bad Iberia experience.

unprofessional and rude cabin crew,Madrid,Basel,Europe,"IBE3260 
Madrid-Basel 
4th of Feb 2019

We booked our flights thru American Airlines. This is just a part of a 3-leg trip from Panama City to Basel. Our flight from Miami to Madrid was also with Iberia, and everything went ok. The Cabin Crew were very professional and helpful. It was a long haul flight. So since they are partners with American Airlines and British Airways, we didnt doubt on Iberia. Boarding was smooth. They don't speak english. They assumed all passengers who are heading to Switzerland are spanish-speaking because they are flying from Madrid. A lot other airlines are hiring bilingual cabin crew to provide better service. Some would even put atleast one FA who speaks the local language of the country of destination- if not, atleast english. Unfortunately, they dont. So sorry for those who non-spanish speakers. Lucky if you get into a flight with a cabin crew who speaks your language. Upon boarding, they have announced that there are not much space for the hand-carry luggages and they suggested the passengers to put the small bags in under the seat in front of them. We assumed that the aircraft is small and that they have smaller compartments. It wasnt too crowded at all by the way. But when we were on board, the flight attendant advised us to remove backpacks (they are not small) from the overhead compartment and put it under the seat in front of us. Again, the backpacks were not small! The allowed size of a handcarry luggage should not exceed to 56cm X 45cm x 25cm; our bag size was 50cm x 40cm x 16cm - and full. It will definitely fit under the seat, but it wont give us even a little leg comfort. I advised the FA who kept talking to us in spanish- even if we are not spanish speaker if she could choose some other smaller bags - form other passengers. We are not first-time travelers. But it was our first time with Iberia and the way they treated us- was very shocking! I don't wonder why a lot people told us ""that's the worst!"" and we didnt listen to them. The FA called the Senior FA and the latter told us we have to put our bags under the seat in front of us. There are other jackets and bags that can be taken away from the overhead compartment, but she decided to take down our large back packs, which has cameras and other electronic devices inside. There is not even a leg room available for us at all. Out of all the passengers, they chose us- a non-spanish speaking couple. She grabbed the other bag and threw hard inside the overhead compartment. Then she grabbed a jacket from the overhead compartment, thinking it was ours, and threw it on us. I told her that is not my jacket and she said ""It doesnt matter, it has to be removed!"" Very unprofessional! We've flown with a lot other airlines- Emirates, Qatar, British Airways, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Turkish, Etihad, Garuda, Tiger, Thai, even Kuwait, and budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryan Air but we have never ever encountered an FA, a SENIOR one, with that kind of attitude. Instead of talking to me in a calm way, she raised her voice and told me ""this is the last thing I will tell you, you have to put your bags under the seat!"" We refused, because the bags are not small not because we didnt want to take it.  It's a huge size back pack. There are other passengers who stowed jackets and smaller bags-  but she decided to decide for us. I told her that there are cameras inside- she said ""Iberia will replace it"". They are just rude and unprofessional. They knew that there are not enough space for the hand carry luggages, they could have taken the huge handcarry luggages and put it in the baggage hold next to all other checked in luggages just like how other airlines are doing it if they failed to monitor and control them during check-in.",February 2019,"February 5, 2019",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,1.0
Worst total experience with an Airline in my life!!!!!!!!,Buenos Aires,Stockholm,International,"I recently travelled from Argentina to Madrid in route to Sweden on the 13th of December. Today the 3th of February and I still have not received my luggage, and finding it very difficult in getting any compensation. In this period I have spoken to over seven different agents who never seem to have the information which i had given to the agent prior having me to explain the situation over again. Imagine being from the Caribbean and getting to Sweden in winter with no luggage. There is a lack of communication between agents but still no one allows you to talk to someone in authority. They asked of me some documents which I emailed right away, and after calling back a few days later the agent mentioned that she could not have opened the file, this sounded really strange but I made different set and sent it over only to call back a few days later and the agent still could open a word document. This all sounded to strange to me asked if that was really the case, after a few minutes she was now able to open the file. The effort in making customer service in companies have been lost and this is the reason why companies like Iberia Airlines have failed me terribly. Today an agent cut me off in the middle of speaking using a horrible method of just repeating that she and other calls coming and said goodbye over me speaking and hung up. This agent named Anna made me realize that i had in deed made a horrible decision in choosing Iberia Airlines. The amount of loss and effort placed in recovering my luggage was not worth it at all, this is continuing to be an up hill battle to get compensated!!! A full detailed complaint with dates and times of events will be posted in other forums because i would hate any one to go through this headache just in travelling.

Punctual but that's all!,Buenos Aires,Madrid,International,"Very disappointing. The flights were on time, I'll give them that but unfortunately that is the only positive point I can think of. We boarded at 2 pm (local time) were fed some kind of late lunch/early dinner at around 4 pm and then nothing at all until around 4 am when they went around serving some snackish type of breakfast!! If one was hungry in the meantime(as obviously everyone was) you had to go beg for something that vaguely resembled a club sandwich. And that was only the beginning of our troubles as they lost my luggage (they just dropped it at Madrid thus never sending it off all the way to Milan (final destination) and if it hadn't been for the amazing ladies at Linate who did their best to track it down and have it sent to my hotel asap I'd still be waiting because Iberia never answered either my emails or calls. Then, given the most uncomfortable conditions we'd had to put up with (seats are rather small) on the first flight we attempted to get emergency seats for my husband (he's 6' 4'') on the way back but they wouldn't even sell them because they claimed they were already taken and suggested we should approach the flight crew instead. We did so and they promised to help but never lifted a finger so while we patiently kept waiting for the attendants to come back to us with an answer random passengers (who were not even tall or big) happily jumped onto the few emergency seats that were free! Not to mention the total chaos that took place every single time we had to board (both in Madrid and Buenos Aires) as they couldn't even be bothered to place signs for the queues so everyone jumped into the wrong line, skipped the queue and so on. All in all, a dreadful experience that I wouldn't recommend to anyone unless you had no other choice and having said this, I'd like to point up that I've flown with various different airlines and even those from the so-called ""developing"" countries have all been far superior in efficiency and way more generous than this airline that (one should think) represents a first-world country.",January 2019,"February 3, 2019",2.0,1.0,2.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,1.0

Efficient.,Birmingham,Granada,Europe,We flew with Iberia from Birmingham to Granada via Madrid. Booking the flights was easy and the chageover at Madrid was not lengthy at all. It's easy to checkin on line for the outgoing flights but the rule that one can't checkin until 24 hours before flying meant we had to ask our hotel the print off our return boarding passes.

Very good company with still margin to improve business class,Madrid,Buenos Aires,International,"Many changes were done on the Iberia business class cabin since its merge with British Airways. Some for the better and some for less costly I would say.  Three main tings count on the business class:  
1. Your seat - Iberia reduced its seat space adding more seats to the class but increased the privacy and personal space and seats are inclining to become full beds.
2. Food and drinks - frequent travelers of Iberia can see a clear down on the menus. quality of the food went slightly down with more modest presentation and no more famous Chefs on the menus. The wines level is definitely not at the level of the ticket price and the over whole feeling is that there is a money saving action taken by the company.

Terrible,Santiago,London,International,"I had flown outbound from London to Santiago with Latam in Business class which was an absolute pleasure. The return in Iberia Business class was unbelievably terrible, despite both being Oneworld members.
My seat for the first leg, Santiago to Madrid, had the worst location in the cabin, right at the front where the cabin narrows up, encroaching into the aisle, and also trafficked heavily by crew working from the galley and passengers going to the toilet. It also offered zero privacy with pretty much every passenger being able to look over each other. My seat and its surroundings were dirty, with food, hair and other residues.
The seat itself was incredibly uncomfortable. I am 6ft2, with shoulders slightly wider than average. I could not physically sit in the seat without my right shoulder overhanging into the aisle. There was literally nowhere to put my elbows either. After having my shoulder knocked too many times i sort of twisted myself into the seat which was terribly uncomfortable, which then caused pain as i have metal screws and a pin in my left leg and hip. 
The flight departed soon after 1.30pm, and almost as soon as we had reached cruising altitude we were served the ""evening"" meal, which was mediocre at best. Later on after being hungry for several hours I discovered there were some dry, measly sandwiches in the galley which we could help ourselves to. 
The entertainment system offered a few films and TV shows, but unlike other airlines whose screens you can only see from directly behind, the array of screens across the width of the cabin was quite a nuisance when the lights were turned off. Also my screen was nit very responsive as touchscreen, and the WiFi didn't work.
After a night of zero sleep, we were served a reasonable breakfast, and eventually the end came to a torturous 12+ hour flight. 
For my 2 hour layover in Madrid airport i went to one of Iberia's lounges, which had reasonable to good shower facilities, mediocre seating, and poor food options. Better than nothing but not a patch on the lounges of British Airways or Latam.
The second leg from Madrid to London was an absolute joke. On this short haul route their idea of Business class was a normal seat with no legroom or entertainment, only towards the front of the plane and with no-one sitting in the middle seat.
In summary, Iberia's Business class is not a patch on those of other airlines. I have even flown longer distances to Australia in Emirates Economy which was far more comfortable than this experience. I would rather cross the Atlantic by rowing boat than travel with Iberia again!",January 2019,"January 19, 2019",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0
"Great ground personnel, pleasant flight and a true meal",Madrid,Miami,International,"British Aiways had canceled my flight to London the night before, went early to the airport to try to obtain a new routing. American Airlines said no, they could not open the ticket (they had sold me the original later notifying me that British Airways was operating the flights). Iberia personnel bent over backwards, agreeing to fly me Madrid-Miami directly, bypassing a London connection and a need to stay in London overnight. Kudos to Noél Ávila Hernández, Iberia airport agent for understanding and helping out. Then, to my surprise, what is usually a long a tiresome flight from Europe to the USA, turned out to be a nice experience, we were given a very good meal (unavailable in american carriers) and excellent service until our arrival.",January 2019,"January 18, 2019",5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Submitted a second time requesting refund and EU legislated compensation for the rental car we had to use to drive instead, same result.  There is no phone number for customer service unless you are preferred customer (doubt there are any).  Finally got a person in sales to help, but still no compensation for rental car, just a refund for the ticket price.

ABSOLUTE SHAMBLES! RUINED MY TRIP,Milan,Ibiza,Europe,"I have already raised my issue within your organisation, but I feel that my issue is still unresolved, hence my need to involve you in helping to resolve this problem.

Here is what happened: Company name: 
Booking reference: MLHKT4 Flight number: ib3255 
 
Departure airport: Malpensa International Airport, MXP 
Scheduled departure time: Tue 22/05/18 14:00 
Arrival airport: MADRID 
Number of passengers: 2 
Other passenger names: Lorraine Sammut 
This happened on May 22nd, 2018

Based on the length of the delay and the scheduled flight length, I tried seeking the fixed compensation as specified in EC 261/2004.

Flight from Malpensa airport was delayed which resulted in us missing our connecting flight from Madrid to Ibiza.

It was meant to arrive at 22:00 and arrive in Ibiza at 23:10 but we left the following day 12:30 and arrived at 13:40 - A total delay of 14hrs!

The airline provided us with accommodation however the hotel we stayed at messed up our sleep too!!!! 
We were woken up at 4am by the receptionist on duty. When I asked if this is a mistake, they said: ""No your flight is leaving soon"". I got to the airport where I met the lovely lady who had assisted us a few hours before looking mortified to see us and it was at that point I immediately realised it was a mistake!

The VIP lounge was still closed, when it finally opened I asked for sleeping facilities and we were directed to a quiet room but it was not enough. I had a wedding to get to, the receptionist was rude and my moods destroyed because apart from the stress caused, I barely slept and had an important ceremony to attend!

Flight 3812 left on time but the whole experience of being excited to be attending a wedding was ruined, not to mention that I disappointed the happy couple and missed half of the ceremony

UNFRIENDLY STAFF LACK OF COHERENCE IN RESPECT TO CARRY ON LUGGAGE,Madrid,Tenerife,Domestic,"I faced the following uncomfortable situation: I had only a carry-on suitcase. I always make sure before I fly that  my bag respects the dimensions and the weight admitted by each airline, as publicly available on the website of the airline.
In Madrid at the boarding gate there were many people with carry-on bags, some of them with larger suitcases than mine, including other bags for the same person. I am very sure of that because one of such persons went just before me: a larger suitcase and another bag. The officer at the gate put a label on my suitcase and not on the suitcase of the other person. When entering in the plane, the flight attendant insisted to place my suitcase in the checked baggage compartment. When I argued that there was another person just in front of me having much more luggage than myself she didn't want to listen. She said in a very rude way that if I do not agree, I am not admitted on the flight. As an irony, the luggage bin above my seat remained empty during the flight, so that there was indeed place for my suitcase. I had to check the luggage. When I showed the free place to the flight attendant, she didn't even excuse herself of the abuse. To summarize, it was an abuse to ask me to check the luggage as long as there was at least one other passenger having more carry-on luggage than me. I like to respect rules, however I understand that rules must be the same for all passengers. And courtesy is mandatory for the staff.",July 2018,"January 16, 2019",2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,3.0,3.0

Never book with Iberia,New York City,Madrid,International,"On Thursday, December 27th, my fiancé and I were scheduled to fly on flight 6252 with service from JFK to Madrid at 9:05 (21:05). At 8:30, we all lined up to board and then after standing for 30 minutes with no direction, we were told that the plane had a mechanical issue and that we needed to sit down. For the following three hours, we were given vague and unhelpful updates roughly once an hour. This was stressful and the staff was not apologetic. Finally, close to 11:30, we were told the flight was cancelled in Spanish. The message was not repeated in English for another three minutes. 

We then proceeded down to baggage claim and there was no one from Iberia to direct us or tell us what was happening. We waited in complete confusion for close to 30 minutes. Finally, we were let through a door and told to write our name, phone number and email on a white sheet of printer paper and that they would be getting buses to take us to a hotel. Everyone on our flight was very confused why we were being asked to write our information down as we assumed that any airline would already have this information in their system. At this point, we took a cab and returned to our apartment in Brooklyn to attempt to get some sleep. We were told we would get a phone call or text letting us know when the plane was fixed. 

At 2:53AM, we woke up to the sound of a text saying our itinerary was changed. We were now scheduled to leave on December 28th at 18:59 to London, have a three-hour layover and then take another flight from London to Madrid. I immediately called Iberia and spoke to an incredibly rude customer service rep. She told me that Iberia already changed my ticket for free so any other change would require a fee. This is absurd. I knew there was a 5:00 (17:00) direct flight on Dec 28th and I at the very least I wanted to get on that. After a very frustrating conversation with no apology, I attempted to get more sleep. 

At 7:05AM, I got another text saying that our original flight was delayed to 15:30 and to call the airport at 12:30 to check. I immediately called Iberia to ask about that flight status and why our itinerary didn’t show that flight and the customer service representative could not explain this. They said that the 15:30 flight did not exist and/or that we didn’t have tickets on it. At this point, we were confused whether we should go back to JFK with no ticket or go for our new flight with the connection. I finally reached a customer service rep, Daniel Espina who told us there was nothing he could do. At that point, I asked to speak to his manager and suddenly he said that he could get us on the 17:00 direct flight. I’m confused why this wasn’t an option from the beginning. When we arrived at the airport and returned to our original gate from the previous night around 3:45PM, we were told that our original flight from Thursday night departed at 3:30 (15:30). I do not understand why we weren’t given the option to be on that flight. The lack of clear communication is unacceptable. 

I have submitted a formal complain to Iberia about the situation, asking for reimbursement for the cabs and hotel room we had to pay for, but did not use in Spain, and I was sent a generic apology email saying it was out of their control. Having an organized professional plan when a flight is cancelled is in your control. Not having people write their contact information on a sheet of printer paper and instead having it in an online portal is in your control. Allowing us to board our original flight and being clear about when that flight would be taking off is in your control. I cannot emphasize enough, Iberia has been the most unprofessional airline I have ever experienced and I have flown too many places to count. 

I hope to be able to update this review with better information, but I’ve been on hold with the airline for the last 35 minutes… they don’t have any number you can call to submit complaints and their online complaint portal is not user friendly. I’m sadly not optimistic.",December 2018,"January 15, 2019",1.0,,,,,,,,
Another excellent Iberia flight,Chicago,Madrid,International,"Iberia Chicago check in was quick and friendly. Security was thorough but moved right along. 
We were again directed to the American Airlines upscale Flagship lounge. We enjoyed a wide variety of self serve tasty food and quality beverages. 
On board the plane, the crew was friendly and efficiently worked through their lengthy list of pre-takeoff tasks that ended with a glass of water or orange juice (westbound they offer water, orange juice or cava). 
The crew handed out hot towels when we were over central Michigan and shortly later came through with the first of many beverage carts. We both selected one of the three quality Spanish red wines from that first cart plus their offering of mixed nuts and Spanish olives. A short time later the crew came back with another beverage round and an appetizer plate that would have made a good meal by itself. Next came the main course (we picked grilled fish) with more beverages and finally the dessert cart. Several times after the meal we were offered after dinner drinks but we simply picked a small glass of superb Spanish Sherry. Then it was convert the seat to a flat bed for hours of sleep before a simple breakfast was served. Some cold yogurt, cold juice and cold fresh fruit with the breakfast proved to be refreshing in the too warm cabin. 
Madrid airport is huge but the long walks felt good after sitting or sleeping in a hot plane cabin for hours.
We always take the three euro +/- express train straight in to Madrid which is so convenient when you arrive with your luggage and jet lag.
Our return trip a little over three weeks later went just as smoothly. The Iberia lounge at Barajas airport provides complete breakfast choices so we skipped eating at our hotel, took the express train back to the airport and enjoyed a relaxing breakfast before take off. Once again the food was excellent, inflight entertainment was more than adequate and the flat beds allowed for napping before arrival.

Avoid if at all possible,London,Madrid,Europe,"Flew Iberia from LHR-MAD on a one day trip because the scheduling was easier as opposed to flying BA. I sat in 10A on an A319 which was an exit row and window seat. An FA did approach me to remind me of the requirements of sitting in the exit row. After eventually working out that I didn't speak Spanish, the FA raced through the clearly scripted English version of the text, so quickly that most of the words were jumbled up and nearly incomprehensible. Apart from that, there was absolutely no interaction with the crew throughout the entire flight. They did the absolute bare minimum required and that was it. With rather scared looks on their faces, they wandered down the plane with their food options (all of which one had to pay for), almost seemingly hoping that they wouldn't have to sell anything or interact with anyone. After they retreated to the back galley they were not sighted for the remainder of the two hour flight. Most travellers had their armrest up for landing, and there were a few window shades that were kept down despite an announcement made from the back. The physical seat is also terrible. It was so thin that it felt like I could've torn through it with a fingernail and a piece of crispy bacon. The armrest was also so short that it was virtually useless, we might not as well have had it. The legroom in the exit row was sufficient, however, if an emergency did happen, I would not want to be a person of great width trying to escape using the exit row as opposed to the front or back doors, as I sense that would be difficult. The interior of the cabin felt very plain, boring and uninviting. It was almost like a Ryanair jet but without the advertising or colour. To make thighs worse for IB, I flew back that evening on British Airways, and had an amazing crew. I would literally say that the BA crew belt the living daylight out of the effort (or lack thereof), of the IB crew, and then some. Based on this singular experience, I would avoid IB at all costs, and fly BA wherever possible instead.",January 2019,"January 13, 2019",2.0,,,,,,,,

I had to check in my cabin baggage, although correct size, check in clerk said possibly insufficient room on plane but they would check it in for free. I padlocked it. When I finally got to Santiago, the lock had been ripped off and thrown back inside the case, the gifts I had had been broken into and a mans watch had been stolen. The flight left one hour late and as a result I missed my connecting flight at Madrid and was put in a substandard hotel near Madrid and told they couldn’t get me on a flight for 2 days. They wouldn’t let me have my cabin luggage because by the time they got around to dealing with me they said the baggage place was closed, so I had no overnight things, clothes, toiletries etc. I arrived at my destination 44 hours later than scheduled. That was 2 days I lost with my young grandson who I had not seen for 2 years. When I submitted a complaint and in particular a request for EU flight compensation, I asked for the reason for the delay and got a stupid response that the delay was beyond their control, but still no actual reason or explanation. I submitted the complaint again and took advice from the consumer advice service which provided the correctly worded letter template for EU flight delay compensation and they replied that I was inconvenienced because of something beyond their control and no explanation. They closed down my complaint references without any explanation or apology.  The return flight on 09/01/2019 was shambolic!  The steward was rude when I got up and asked for water having been seated for several hours and I was thirsty and becoming dehydrated.  The steward was sitting in the galley reading a newspaper.  He sent me back to my seat.  When I brought the water I asked him where the call button was and he told me that it was only for emergencies and asking for water was not an emergency.  So there is no proper “in service” because the crew are too busy faffing in business class or sitting on their backsides reading newspapers.   When I arrived at Madrid the information board didn’t provide connecting flight info. It just said to contact the company!  How?  Why?  No idea!  Had to go to the VIP lounge to ask where passengers were meant to go and the information provided contradicted with the boarding card.  Even asked an airport policeman and he said the boarding card information was wrong.  The whole experience with Iberia was shambolic!  Added to this was that you now have to pay for alcohol on long haul trips, other than wine with dinner ( which I don’t drink). It costs 5 euros for a tot of whisky.  Staff are rude and surly.  If they think they are special because they work on a plane they need to remember that passengers pay their wages.  If I can avoid flying Iberia I definitely will look at the alternatives even if it means paying a little more.  Shocking service, shocking manners.

Desaster,Quito,Madrid,International,"Just left the Iberia plane from our flight Quito-Madrid.

The whole family (4 persons) was booked on Premium Economy.

Summary: worst flight experience ever.

- unbelievable unfriendly personnel (no hello, no please, no sorry, not one single smile during 10 hours)

- personnel was not capable to speak (any kind of) English (was easier for us to understand their Spanish)

- no introduction, no hallo from the captain, no welcome from the arrogant flight personnel

- 1,5 hours delay: no sorry, no thanx for the patience

- food was worse than dog food (at least the portions were extremely small)

- food was exactly the same as in standard economy (but yes: on a ceramic plate)

The only great thing: seats and space. But this point goes to Airbus Industries, not to Iberia.

The flight spoiled the otherwise amazing trip,Munich,Havana,International,"- the stuff is rude and does not appear to pay attention to or consider any customer input (as a Macedonian citizen, I explained I did not need Visa to travel to Cuba. Nevertheless, I had to run around the airoprt and buy one, or risk not being admitted to the flight).

- I arrived on time, my luggage followed after 24 hours (had no toothbrush, as in Cuba is hard to find and buy one; paied 70 EUR for a cab to go back to the airport to pick up my luggage the day after).

- On the way back I was moved to the flight on the following day. I absolutely had to fly on the day and be in office within 24hrs. Only after crying, arguing, and cashing out 200 EUR, I was allowed to take the return flight I originally booked.

- The ONLY positive aspect was one nice stewardess who took the time to cheer me up. Her other colleagues were rude and showed no politeness toward the passengers.

"poor service, lack of communication",London,Punta Arenas,International,"Iberia seems to be doing its best to build up a catalogue of poor service records. First, a month ago, I flew from London to Madrid and then Santiago de Compostella. The first flight was two hours late, not Iberia's fault entirely, as weather played a hand. The second arrived four hours late, so late I missed the lecture I was due to give. Iberia's commercial tactic used to avoid the claims passengers affected by such delays can correctly submit is simply not to inform those passengers of their rights, or reply to them or their legal representatives when they do complain and claim.

Second, I am due to fly with Iberia (that was a mistake!) tomorrow from London to Chile. Despite all the encouragement to do so, when you try and check in online, nothing happens. When you eventually find a number to contact to find out what is going on, you discover that part of the website is down and will be for the foreseeable future (day at least). Simple common sense says they should put a notice saying this on their main website, but do they, NO!! And the person you speak to seems to have no comprehension that this is pretty dismal service worthy of an apology. However I wonder if this is because there is actually a customs/baggage strike at Madrid airport that I suspect Iberia don't want you to know about, and when you do follow the instructions and try and check in at the airport itself you will discover that your flight has actually been cancelled at which point you are captive to their incpompetence.",January 2019,"January 7, 2019",1.0,,,,,,,,
Terrible service,Santiago,Madrid,International,"Problems could happen but...
For some reason that I don’t know yet the flight was cancelled... or deleted for more than 14 hours. The informations to go to the bus was not clear, the girl at the bus station told me to wait in a line but let the all the other people go and pass me without a reason. Ok the hotel was just ok but I don’t know about the lunch because I wanted to eat something but for dinner we have only two choices César salad or beef with rice. The bus driver suppose to bring us to the airport at 11pm but he pretended to wait for every single late person. We left at 11:45 from the hotel we arrived about 00:00 great! More than 2 hours on the lane for the check in, no water, no explanation on for the correct lane (we was in the wrong lane for 25 mins). When finally we arrived close to the check in, they move 3 check in for the business and 2 for the economy. So, this plane could have about 450/500 people, and I was one of the last!!! I suppose to have a connection to Milan but surprise! No seat available for the day we arrive, we will leave next day, after 17 more hours. We will stay in new hotel without our baggage.

Though I’m a One World Sapphire member.

But she never gave us the accurate answer and refuse to answer my question, finally with laughing and starting to talk to her colleague in Spanish.
I clearly felt her discrimination against me, and was very disappointed.
Actually there is no problem from Tokyo to Barcelona on British Airways.

And one of staffs boarded on a same flight as a customer stting next to my wife. It's OK, but some their cabin crew always keep chatting with this customer even while taking off and landing. I'm very surprised at and it's first time to see such a thing on board.

I usually go to Spain on my busiess trip once or twice in a year, but I decide never to choose Iberia Airline again. Their service is so bad and I will never forget their prejudice against my family.

Shady business.

Check-in process: The airline does not have a contract with TSA pre-check?!!! You can’t choose seats online, you have to call to select a seat in advance and there’s no map available online to refer to, so you have to rely on the description from the representative on the phone and  just in your brain imagine where your seat will be. When the beverage cart comes around they don’t make eye contact, they just stroll and wait for you to tell them what you want. They passed right by me and did not ask if I wanted anything, actually they avoided eye contact. Later when I asked for a glass of wine they told me I had to wait for the cart to come back around. They proceeded to mansplain to me that they don’t disturb passengers when they’re watching movies. I told them that I was not watching the movie when the attendant was passing by and that she did not ask for my order. Next thing I know two man are in my face arguing that I must have been watching a movie and they don’t disturb passengers when they have their screen on. Food was never offered as well and there was no call light for the attendant. I was in seat 7A. No pillows, no blankets sure makes an 11 hr flight less than comfortable. They charge you for everything, the seat, food, the coffee in the morning €3.50 and it was disgusting. Not worth it, just pay the extra few dollars on a more professional and reputable airline that treats humans with respect and courtesy.

Iberia Check-in desk at JFK,New York City,Madrid,International,"This place is well hidden, and, obviously, for a good reason. It is toward the back, around a corner of the right side of Terminal 7. The area is tiny, just a few seats, 7, actually. Can you imagine waiting to check in with family to a take a flight to Madrdid, and all 300 people are crammed into the tiny area at once? Hi... my name is Mr Sadine, and ... what do you know... I luv, luv, luv cans!

It is sort of throw back to the late 1960's, early 1970's era of flying. No comforts afforded, not even an electronic check in. And, of course, since Spanish don't like arguing and conversing at all... the lines at the check-in counters, only 7 counters, with 2 reserved for biz and 1st classes, move at just about the speed of a race between two slugs on valium. In fact, the later might be even faster.

Kidding aside, I am surprised they do not use abbaccus instead of computers behind the counter. Such would give it that ""je ne quois"" authenticity to the caveman's check-in counter.

Oh, yeah... their app. LOL!!! Yep, it has graphics, and links you can tap. The only problem is that it is very X-gen/Millennial... works whenever it feels like it. Actually, in 5 years of travelling (yeah, I booked AA, but somehow IB shows up...) it hasn't worked once!

BTW, if you booked your flight to MAD with AA, and you end up with IB, attempt to Check-In via AA app... it sends you to IB's app, which, when it decides to work, says that you are being sent back to the AA app, since you booked the ticket with AA. 

So, if you want to find out the answer to the eternal question - who was first, the egg, or the chicken? Go play musical apps merry go around between AA and IB... In the very least, it will help you kill time doing the incredibly long check-in lines.

They could however not tell me how I can buy the most necessary stuff for this lousy amount of money. It will just be enough to buy some sun cream and a pair of havaianas...

Safety didn’t seem to be a priority as far as pre-take off and landing checks were concerned. Very cursory cabin checks were undertaken and large carry on bags were allowed to remain on seats for both take off and landing. The crew seemed totally disinterested in the safety implications.

Food and beverage service seemed to be a chore. On one occasion I went to the galley to request a drink, two staff were idly chatting to each other. Despite one of them certainly being aware of my presence they totally ignored me and disappeared in the other direction!

The toilet was a disgrace and didn’t appear to have been cleaned throughout the 11 hour flight.

Below are details of our interactions with this airline - which has been generally pathetic, unhelpful and insulting. Would strongl suggest avoiding this airline.

12/21 - was told at the luggage desk our luggage had been left in London but that one bag would be delivered that evening.

Later called multiple times, lost luggage line is always a busy signal. Finally when contacting the reservation line was transferred to lost luggage who reiterated that the luggage would be delivered asap. Unhelpfully, we needed o take an onward journey, but Iberia was not able to tell us what the process wig our lugage would be.

12/22 - called, lost luggage line was busy. After waiting on hold for an hour was told lost luggage was not in operation over the weekend so we had no means of receiving updates except via the website.

12/24 - called at 12:03, spoke to Noel Vin, was told they could not transfer us to lost luggage. When trying to contact lost luggage via her direction, the line did not work (as before, continuous busy signal).

On calling a second time was told we could not be transferred to lost luggage because the operator did not have that ability. We were given a non-functional Spanish number to call about our lost luggage.

12/26, 12/27, 12/28

Multiple calls with no help at all from the airline. Expect to begin dispute resolution procedures when we return to London given the poor treatment we have received and the impact on our travels.",December 2018,"December 27, 2018",1.0,,,,,,,1.0,
Lost baggage and didn't serve me my meal on an 8 hour flight,Barcelona,Boston,International,"My experience with Iberia could not have been worse. 
First, they wouldn't let me check in online or pay for my extra baggage in advance, causing me to pay double for the bag at the airport.
I was supposed to receive a meal on an 8 hour flight, but the flight attendants said I was not on their list and provided all the other passengers around me with their meals. After speaking with a representative after my flight, I received a confirmation that I was was supposed to receive a meal. 
You cannot complain to any person, but only file a complaint online. When I tried to speak with a supervisor, they claimed there isn't one. 
Lastly, they lost my luggage and once again, there was no one to speak with.

"Lost bags, impossible customer service",Tenerife,Philadelphia,International,"Fortunately they lost our bags coming home, but from the information we were able to acquire our bags never made it past the check in counter. The only time our bags were scanned was after we checked them, past that no one knew where they were. Even more frustrating is the loops you go through trying to get any information.  Obviously philly doesn’t have any Iberia customer service department so we mostly went through American Airlines who were surprisingly helpful.  
When we tried calling Iberia, we only got a voice prompt and when you ask for baggage department you seem to have a 50/50 shot of going to a person who can’t tell you anything and cannot transfer you to a department that can and they just tell you to call back and say “baggage reclaim. “ the other times you get a recorded voice message that tells you to look for your bags online.

The window corridors are best for people travelling alone because the seats are in a row, so one passenger cannot see or talk to the one in front or behind.

Worst customer experience I’ve ever had ever.,San Francisco,Casablanca,International,"Iberia is absolutely terrible. Truly beyond the worst. I’ve never seen anything like it. We booked an Iberian flight from SFO to Casablanca. They ended up using partner airliners British Airways and Royal Air Maroc. Our bags got lost on the long  trek from SFO-LON-MAD-CMN. The handoff between BA and Royal Air was in Madrid, which luggage in Madrid is handled by Iberia. We believe the bags were lost there. When we arrived off our flight from Casablanca, the bags never arrived. Air Maroc refused to file a lost luggage claim, because our luggage was not in there system, but when we called BA and also Iberia, they both told us they can’t do it because international policy states that the last leg were the bag was lost is responsible, and hence it’s Royal Air Maroc, as that was the last leg. We called Iberia begging for assistance since we purchased the flights through them, and neither BA or Royal Air Maroc  were “able” to file the claim. We called two separate times, my partrner called once, and I a separate time, both times they said there was nothing that they could do, and hung up, Anna, the woman I was speaking with, said there was no manager and nothing they could to, click. I was so shocked! We purchased the ticket though Iberia and they linked the flights  through  BA and Royal Air. If neither BA or Royal Maroc claim responsibility, then who? Iberia is the company whom we purchased and Iberia is also the company that handles baggage in Madrid for BA and Air Maroc. It’s incredibly offensive to have neither airline take responsibility and literally leave you in an impossible  position. We need to file a claim to get our bags, but no one will left us file the claim! Iberia’s customer service is really bottom of the barrel. I have never experienced anything quite so low.

I will not travell with Iberia again,Panama City,Florence,International,"The company just doesn’t work on the ground.

Ground Employees are extremely rude and arrogant.
The conection at Barajas is the worst nightmare you can imagine, Iberia employees are just not able to send you to the right gate. And distances are just huge! Not to mention the unpleasant underground train.

What’s the problem of Barajas and air conditioning?

I heard from an Iberia employee, actually the one who sent me to the wrong connecting gate, that “she was trying to help me”. Actually I though she was working, and in the worst possible mood.

Onboard Wi-Fi didn’t work on one of the long flights.
And the A330 toilet appearance reveals the airplane age!

Intra-European flights were made on extremely old A319 with the infamous 3 seat configuration, not selling the middle one, and for sure meal option is just a rethoric figure.
Whenever you book your intra-European flights throughout the web, they let you think the configuration is 2X2.  That is just disrespectful,

The bussines configuration on their A330 is just claustrophobic and on the way to Madrid out of Panama City the airplane was as hot as a “sudatorium”.

Bussines lounge at Barajas was nice, as well as the onboard service and the Inflight entertainment system. When operating WI-Fi is also cool, though expensive.

be careful with special luggage,Athens,Madrid,Europe,"Hello all! 
I would like to give my opinion for those who travel with special luggage through Iberia. I had to bring two snowboards on different flights and on both ... something happened.

As you know, you have to call another cost number to hire special staff... so since the beginning something does not like so good... not once but two calls to confirm.

After that, at the airport, you never know if your luggage has been confirm or not. And if yes... how much. Despite the fact you might have agreed 45 euro... you need to cross your fingers at the airport during the check in because they might have forgotten it.

The first time, we were waiting a long time but the second was catastrophic. The lady attending us did not understand nothing at all ( talking in her language) because without our will, she charged automatically 60 euros for snowboard ( WITHOUT PIN CODE REQUEST) we said that we pay 45 which is the price agreed by phone. After talking to manager, ok anyone can make mistakes so they will return our 60euros... after paying 45 euros in additio!!n ( those agreed) Ok it is Iberia not another low cost company. They told us they will be returned back. 

After a week, still my bank account has 60 euros less so let’s discuss  again upon arrival again in Athens.

To sum up, personal at the airport told us to call Iberia by phone because they can not do anything even Acknowing the problem!

Ok call Iberia, by phone they can do nothing just though customer service website.

Ok kindly contact to customer service,  explained all facts ( I think it is something which usually happens in any shop and they simply  return your money to the same credit card). However they communicated me that this is the price for hand luggage which they asked me to bring down instead at the cabin because of lack of space for free!!!

This is not posible because at the airport they knew and know  about their mistake charging 60 euros in addition. So another message with the same result and 60 euros donation to Iberia by themselves.

I just can not believe that such “good company” which all of us trust to travel and move important things, acts like this. If you must move special luggage like me please CHOOSE ANOTHER  because they have lost the reputation they had for 60 euros.

I hope my experience is useful for someone else. I don’t know how this procedure is on others but once you have to call  to a cost number.... bad feeling...

4. When informing them of the above, and requesting at least some sort of lounge access, I was told to SLEEP ON THE FLOOR IN THE TERMINAL.

My flight should leave at 1:00PM and there would be a second flight to Brazil at 4:30PM but Iberia canceled my flight to join the passengers of the two flights on the 4:30PM flight. Iberia did not provide any kind of explanation to the passengers and also did not give any type of support until the moment of shipment. Neither water.
At flight 4:30PM boarding procedure was a total mess because there were duplicate seats marked and Iberia to refrain from solving the problem simply informed that the seats marked was canceled and would be worth the order of arrival on the plane.
After everyone boarded and the passengers themselves solved the seating problems (the crew just stay seeing and did nothing) the plane began to tax and there could be a noise as if there was a problem in the landing gear. The plane returned to the finger and disembarked of the aircraft for an evaluation.
After an hour of waiting, new boarding and when we began to tax we heard the same noise.
The scareds passengers asked that the plane return to the finger to leave tha aircraft and but they was ignored by the crew. Many desperate passengers stood up as the plane headed for the takeoff place, but the crew simply asked to be seated and the take-off procedure continued.
It was the first time I saw dozens of passengers standing (that's right, standing) during a takeoff.

Makes it harder for its customers,Lisbon,Madrid,Europe,"I had an issue checking in online. Despite the fact that I had flown Iberia Air on the way to my destination, on the way back, the website kept saying that there was an issue with the country of issue for my documents. Of course this was all after getting notations that passenger information was all correct. Only after hitting the final button would it bounce me back to the initial screen citing wrong country of issuance. Incredibly frustrating. 

In Lisbon, they open the counters two hours before the flight even though Lisbon is known as a slow airport. I'm not sure how people waiting in the long lines get through security and then customs. 

In Madrid, we had long delays because of a maintenence issue. They were not very good explaining what the delay was. When we got on board did we know that it was a brake issue and that they were replacing a part.

The service on the plane leaves a lot to be desired. In other international flights I have taken (about 4 a year), you get a hot towel and at some point a bottle water. You got neither on Iberia. Food was mediocre even based on economy standards. I did find the crew to be nice though. 

Lastly, the priority bags didn't come out first. A priority bag didn't come out until about the 30th bag. And then they were intermittent; no different than a non-priority bag. I didn't get my bag for about 75 minutes after my plane had landed.",,"December 17, 2018",2.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,,,

The app is poorly designed, making check-in a bit more of a hassle than normal, but it worked in the end. The gate agents seemed confused by our electronic tickets and sent us to the counter to get paper ones when we tried to board - again, no big deal, just a bit annoying. The flight itself was fine - left on time, plane seemed sufficiently clean (can't say about the bathrooms, as I didn't use them). Since we bought the cheapest tickets, it didn't include meal or beverage services. Those were supposedly available for purchase using the seatback tablet, but the Store option never seemed functional. Wasn't a big deal for us - we'd had a huge dinner earlier that evening and were in a turkey-induced-coma by takeoff. Crew seemed friendly enough. Comfort was mediocre - minimal legroom, hard seats, the usual. My recommendation - it's a decent airline for budget travelers (I can hardly fly to the West coast for such a cheap price).

Their website is a disaster and finding information about that type of booking is impossible.  After speaking with a rep (average per call was 45 minutes), we joined Avios (their frequent flier program) as instructed and transferred the necessary miles in from Amex. I then called (months before our flight) and with the help of the rep found flights that had tickets-for-mileage available and booked. However, I did not receive a confirmation.  So, after a couple of weeks, I tried again to log in (more torture; change password; involuntarily logged off; try again) and then see only my reservation, not my wife’s which was put under a separate booking number; and mine is for coach going to Madrid. After nearly an hour on the phone, I get to a rep who tells me that I am booked in coach going and first class coming home, while my wife is booked in business going and coach coming home.  And there are no seats available to change that. He then told me that I had selected that booking online - even though you cannot book seats with mileage online!

We were told that they could not place us on the next plane though there were available seats.  The reason cited was that they could put us up in a hotel in Madrid but not Miami (no connecting flights from Miami to our final destination that day).  I told them that I would pay for a hotel in Miami and we could take the first flight out of Miami to Jamaica the following day.  They refused and we were stranded in Madrid for 24 hours rather than in Miami.  We had to practically beg for a lunch voucher at the airport and our bags for the unexpected overnight stay.    One of the representatives continued to speak to us in Spanish though she knew we didn't speak Spanish.  It was by far the worst customer service that I have ever experienced.

Mixed service,New York City,Marrakech,International,"I traveled with Iberian on 3 legs of an international trip. I took them from Madrid to Casablanca, Marrakech to Madrid, and Madrid to New York (JFK).

My flight from Madrid to Casablanca was late by about 45 min. They never posted a boarding gate on any of the boards even when the plane was boarding which was very confusing. The flight attendants were nice but they provided absolutely nothing for cabin service. If you want water be prepared to pay for it.

My flight from Marrakech to Madrid was the first time I checked luggage with them. They were an absolute nightmare for luggage. I stood in line 50min to drop and bag. They had lots of staff just standing around - not helping. They only had 2 lanes open - the guys for business class and this lady in training. She was also eating lunch while having 70+ passengers in line. The flight from Marrakech to Casablanca was fine. The on board service was pleasant. When I got to Madrid - it took Iberian just shy of an hour to get bags onto the belt - which was a long time compared to other carriers.

On contrast my flight to JFK was quite pleasant. A little challenging to locate the right check in place but once I found the US departures desks - everything was smooth.

Refusal to check luggage through,Barcelona,Chicago,International,"Travelling from Barcelona overseas with Iberia is a nightmare. You have to fly via Madrid which would otherwise be ok, but unless you pay a massive upcharge for having the connections on the same booking they won't let you check your luggage through. My ticket would have cost some 1500€ more had I bought a Barcelona-America-Barcelona ticket compared to Madrid-America-Madrid. So obviously one takes a separate ticket BCN-MAD-BCN to save way over 1000€. So what does Iberia do? They refuse to check your luggage through - only airline I know IN the whole world that won't allow you to check your bag through so despite having two tickets both on the same airline. As a result of the slow luggage delivery in Madrid and long queue to recheck my bag I was sure I would miss my flight. Luckily I did not but the whole debacle was completely avoidable if Iberia had even a modicum of common sense in its customer service policies. They seem to think they are a low cost airline that should try to trick clients in any way possible to charge more and if the clients find a way past their upcharges then they should be punished.
Do they think I will book with then again and next time and pay the higher price or are they just happy to lose another customer? Must say though, BA has become so awful too lately that this whole mess may just be an IAG issue, not Iberia specific.",,"December 17, 2018",1.0,,,,,,,,

WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE,Nice,Madrid,Europe,"I am in the hospitality industry and really don't like writing bad reviews, but I can not go on another day without telling everyone how bad Iberia airlines is! Let me start of by saying the story gets worse and worse. I had a flight from Nice, France to Madrid and checked 4 bags, arrived in Madrid to find NONE of my bags got on the flight nor did half the plane's bags. The customer service in the airport in Madrid was non-existent, each member simply did not care and sounded like robot when I expressed my concerns. I was only in Madrid for 48hrs with NOTHING. Bags came more than 24hrs later and ruin my whole experience to a country/area that i have never been too. Now, here is where the story gets worse. I fly from Madrid back home (Boston) and the same thing happens AGAIN to my boyfriends bag, never shows up. This is since 12/9/18. He has been on the phone with them daily and no one can locate his bag ANYWHERE even with a baggage number and bar-code.

Very Good Airline,Frankfurt,Madrid,Europe,"Generaly, business class is not recommended within Europe as the distances are very short, so why bother paying extra, but depending on the flight time, Iberia business is class is a pretty good deal between FRA and MAD. We had no choice as the price for coach and business was about the same, so took the extra amenity of flying business. Dinner on late evening flights are very good, as are the wines and after dinner sherries.Iberia needs to improve: the food in the business class lounges. it used to be fabulous, but now the lounge received a fabulous physical upgrade, but the food was left behind. Their beverages and wines are still a good quality, but were better before the upgrade.  Their on-time rate for us has always been 100%. Very punctual. Service at the counter in FRA can be spotty as they only open 2 hours before departure and sometimes can be late arriving at the counter.

"Surprisingly good, long overnight flight after the chaos at the airport",Johannesburg,Madrid,International,"After finally discovering where the check in counters were at Johannesburg International Airport I found myself waiting for ever in the Business Class check in queue behind several groups of families with small children They all seemed to have problems in checking in with their assorted baggage, prams etc. When I finally got to the check in the lady she was super friendly, apologetic and had my check in processed within a couple of minutes. Apparently they were having problems with their systems. 

At the gate there was no special recognition of business class passengers and we were all herded onto a crowded bus. Awful. Felling pretty disgruntled and fed up, I climbed the steps to the plane but once inside things started to look up. I had Seat 1C in business class. The configuration is 1/2/1. Actually I thought that the seats were similar to those in the excellent Emirates business class on their A380. This plane was, however, an A 330-200. 

Service started with a small hot towel delivered on a little white tray and a choice of cava, orange juice or water before take off. Once in the air we were served dinner. The starters was a full tray of delicacies such as tuna carpacchio, cheddar cheese (!), chicken consomme and a small salad. For the main course I had the wild mushroom and artichoke ravioli. Noticing Pacharan on the drinks list I had a glass as an apertitif. Afterwards I focused on the red wine which was Luis Cana Reserva Seleccion de Familia 2012. After the pistachio ice cream with flaked almonds as a dessert I couldn't resist a glass or two of Gran Duque de Alba brandy. To top off an excellent evenings meal I tried the very sweet Cardenal Cisneros sherry from Jerez de la Frontera. The service was impeccable was throughout. 

After a comfortable night, getting some good sleep on the 180° flat bed I awoke in time to enjoy the breakfast. In fact breakfast served about 90 minutes before arrival. It comprised omelette with meat cuts, a flat, squashed, croissant fresh fruit, a tub of yoghourt, orange juice and coffee.

Never Again,New York City,Tenerife,International,"This airline seeks out the most incompetent people and hires them! From the word go, this airline was terrible.  Their check in attendants rude and not helpful at all. They state in their flight magazine that all flights land and takeoff from the same terminal in Madrid. This is not the case. It took over 30 minutes of traveling the airport to get to our gates coming and going. And this was quite a challenge because we had about 30 minutes to get to our gate due to a late departure from Tenerife caused by the most disorganized boarding process I have ever witnessed.  

On the first half of our trip - They lost our bags in Madrid and would not deliver to our villa. Told us to check online for the bags arrival and come to the airport to pick up which we did. When we arrived for our bags, they said we couldnt have them until 8:30pm which was hours away so we incurred more transit fees to go back at 8:30 for our bags.  When we arrived to Miami on the return flight our connections were all canceled due to weather. Only one bag of seven made it to Miami. We were told a bag was in JFK, one wasn’t scanned at all and the rest were in Madrid. Long story short on the baggage we finally picked up several missing bags in Charlotte our original final destination and one bag was delivered to my daughter’s home.  

The flight attendants were rude and heaven forbid if you asked for something to drink! But when you declined coffee during meal service they continued to ask you if you wanted coffee. No, I don’t want coffee - I want some dang water.  If they have you water, it was a mere 3-4 oz with no offer to refill. We were dehydrated after our 9 hour flight.  

The staff at the airports and on phone were of no help. All they would do is deflect your questions and tell to go to someone else for help. The Iberia customer service person in Miami at baggage was barely a live human being.  He was so old and couldn’t work his computer or flip phone. He told us to go to American Airlines for help since our US flights were on American Airlines which didn’t make sense as Iberia is the airline that had our luggage. This man literally took about 30-34 minutes per
Customer to basically tell them he couldn’t help them and they needed to go elsewhere.

Mistake and misinformation caused major stress,Alicante,Madrid,Domestic,"I flew with Iberia for the 1st leg of my journey (Alicante-Madrid-Toronto-Ottawa) and though it was the smallest, it caused me the most stress! When checking in, it was very unclear regarding how much luggage I was allowed. Usually when it's long-haul, it's assumed you get a checked bag or at least asked when purchasing if you'd like to pre-pay for one. When I printed my boarding pass, it said right on in that luggage was not included. Not sure if I was going to be caught having to pay more at the baggage drop, I called their help line and they confirmed that I did in fact have luggage included- their boarding passes just say that it's not.... how nice! Not the end of the world but can cause unnecessary confusion. THEN, when I was traveling, the agent who checked my luggage failed to notice my full flight itinerary and labelled Madrid as the final destination for my luggage. Though I wish I had noticed sooner, I luckily thought to ask about it when I arrived in Madrid. Sure enough, I had to run around on shuttle buses to claim my luggage, re-check it, and go through security again all because of this... thank god it was a 5 hour layover!!

You have to reserve meals online, otherwise you have to pay out of pocket (but their website wasn't clear about this when I booked my ticket.)

They don't have a free beverage service, so you can't even get a Diet Coke without paying several euros for it, and they don't offer water.  You have to ask for it, and then you get a small, half-filled cup.

When I did ask for water, the flight attendants rolled their eyes and acted like it was an imposition.

Iberia flights a mixed bag,Miami,Rome,International,"Let me start off by saying that their website is a bit sketchy. I had a difficult time keeping the website in English; it kept switching over to Spanish. I finally went to FinnAir (they're part of the OneWorld network) and used their website to update passport data, emergency contact info, and get boarding passes. 

We had a mix of seats on the flight going over and coming home. Going over to Madrid from Miami we upgraded to Business Plus and that was fine, not exceptional, but okay. Nice seat to sleep in since it pushed out. Large TV screen and food/meals were good, especially the wine. The flight from Madrid to Rome was more tight with the seat back of the previous row in your face. This was only a 2 1/2 hour flight so we could live with that. Let me say that Iberia appears to fly their international flights in and out of Madrid from a satellite terminal, 4S, which is way off from the main terminal. It took about 25-30 minutes to get to the main terminal where we had to catch the next leg to Rome. To get there was a combination of elevators, escalators, tram, and walking. Plan accordingly if you're connecting through the satellite terminal. 

Coming back was a really short light from Barcelona to Madrid, no big deal. But, we arrived in the main terminal and then had to get to the Madrid satellite terminal, check in with passport control, and then a second passport control by the US agents in terminal 4S. We just made our flight and we had over an hour between flights, which was not enough time. BTW, early on, Iberia had changed the time of the first leg of our trip from Miami to Madrid and never looked at the connecting leg. We would have completely missed our connecting flight. Who in the heck does that? I noticed it and called to have them change our flight from Madrid to Rome.

I was appalled by the lack of instruction from the flight attendants when landing in Miami. We were still on the runway and taxiing to the gate when people began standing up and moving down the aisle to get in line. People were also opening up the overhead compartments while the plane was moving. A real safety hazard, especially if a bag came out of the overhead. No one in charge said anything. 

I probably won't fly them again even though their pricing was the most competitive.",November 2018,"December 6, 2018",3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0
Average Business Class,Chicago,Madrid,International,"Had purchased premium economy and received an email about a week in advance to buy-up to business for around $200 - so I accepted the offer.  

Pros:
- lie flat seats
- large monitor if you want to watch the entertainment
- 1-2-1 configuration so I was able to get on the one seat side and have a window and an aisle
- friendly flight attendants
- arrivals lounge in Madrid (kind of hidden and unknown) so you can shower at the end of your journey/start of your day - open to business class customers

Cons:
- was difficult to sleep because there is no barrier to the aisle - so every time someone walked but they may accidentally brush against me
- cannot use TSA Pre-Check - Iberia is not part of the program
- cannot print boarding passes at home or use mobile boarding passes - need to see an agent to get a boarding pass
- limited menu choice and the taste of the food wasn't there - I expected Spanish food but instead got cafeteria food

Sometimes I like to order a kosher or vegetarian meal so I eat first and can go to sleep.  When they brought my kosher food it was frozen, so I asked if I could have it later once it was defrosted. The answer was now or I throw it away. I explained I could not eat it because it was frozen, so the flight attendant proceeded to put it in the garbage, in front of my eyes.

Last Name Doesn't Mean Last Name and It's The Costumers Fault.,London,Bogota,International,"I bought tickets to Colombia back in September, and I have just realised that both my name and the second traveler surnames are in the incorrect order. 

This didn't sound like a mistake I would do, so I went through the process of buying another flight to check how Iberia asks for their passenger details. I have noticed that their contact detail box says: Name, Surname/Last Name, Second Last name. (screenshot attached).

My full name: Andre Manuel Leite Fonseca. When I had to fill the below form, I wrote that my last name was: Fonseca. I understand that Spanish surnames work in a different way but my last (ULTIMO) name IS Fonseca, indeed. 

I thought that I would quickly solve this over a phone call. I was wrong. Called the costumer service, and after wasting a few hours of my evening, I was told over and over that I had to pay a fee of 30 pounds for each ticket to change the names. I am shocked. 

I understand that in Spain surnames don't work quite in the same way. However, last name, is last name.(""último"" in spanish) And my last name is Fonseca. I do have another surname, which is Leite, and that is what I thought I had to write on the second box.

I refuse to pay for a mistake I didn't make.

Disappointing flight from start to finish. Think twice before booking.,Madrid,Lima,International,"We booked to fly to Lima, Peru through British Airways (BA) and they routed us on Iberia (IB) going via Madrid as they done do Lima direct. I felt comfortable selecting the Iberia flight knowing that the two airlines merged several years ago , and I assumed they would be quite similar in standard. Unfortunately that was not the case, Iberia is a vastly inferior service with lazy staff who treat passengers with disdain.
We flew in Premium Economy(PE), something that IB has added to their aircraft around 18 months ago; we traveled on a Airbus 340-600. 
Boarding: the gate was absolute chaos- no signage to indicate where each class of travel should queue, and only 2 staff members to manage a crowd of 350 passengers. No priority given to people in wheelchairs or families traveling with push buggies etc. 
Onboard: the PE hard product looked good; Seats were standard premium economy and the bulkhead seat was spacious. The tv screens were modern- large with sharp picture quality. Unfortunately there were several coffee stains on the cabin walls and my footrest was broken. 
The crew: they were very lax. No cabin crew pointing out emergency exit, or any form of demo - just a pre recorded met. Throughout the 12 hour flight when ever the captain turned on the fasten seatbelt sign (5-6 times) , the crew only made verbal announcements but no crew member actually came round to check that passengers were safely buckled up. When there was turbulence during meal service the crew would just carry on - even walking around with a hot pot of coffee serving passengers! The toilets were dirty all three times I used the facilities- no crew went in to tidy it at any point during the flight. The crew were literally just doing the bare essentials- well, not even. They were not particularly friendly either, no smiles no banter, just dropped the food on your tray table and moved to the next seat. Between meal service there were no crew to be seen. 
The food and beverages: the food in PE was economy food, as were the beverages (wine choice was “red or white”) and no spirits were served. No pre meal drinks service either. The food menu listed did not match the food being served. 
Summary: Iberia as a whole were extremely disappointing. The crews lack of adherence to standard air safety protocol is concerning. Iberia’s premium economy product was well below par and not worth what you pay for it.

I wish i stayed in San Jose,San Jose,Madrid,International,"With the annoying news that my Avianca flight was delayed by about ten hours and I would miss my connecting flight from Bogota to Heathrow I agreed to going on an Iberia flight to Madrid instead of spending another night in Costa Rica. I wish I had took longer to think about the choices. 

i explained that I had a vegan meal booked with Aviance. I was told there would be nothing available on the flight so was given vouchers to use in the airport. So i could by some food that would go soggy by the time I ate it. On the plane I was crammed into a tiony space in between elbows McGee and fidget mcfidget face, whilst little miss i want to be horizontal in front of me was insisting on sitting on my lap. 

The staff looked as if they had worked for 24 hours, lifeless and knackered. I was still offered food even though there was nothing available. I found the staff inattentive, awake grouch and dying for a drink i called for assistance which came about fifteen minutes later. The air hostess was nice enough to give me a tea spoon of water. 

More food came later in the flight. Ham and cheese sandwiches! Perfect for a vegan. I did eat the little fruit salad that came with it.

How does this even happen?,Boston,Marrakech,International,"Travel: from Boston to Marrakech via Madrid
Dates/times: departed Boston November 15 @5:30pm
Online Check-in: unavailable

We arrived at Boston airport around 3pm for a 5:30 flight.  After a half hour wait in line, we got to the check in desk.  I have our names, passports, and confirmation number to the 2 agents working at the station.  However, in their computer system my tickets came up as ""exchange"" and they couldn't let us board because they couldn't see that I paid for the tickets.  As I had booked on iberia.com, I found this rather odd and asked if they needed to see my receipt/confirmation - they said no, and that I needed to call customer support and get the ticket numbers.
Call 1 - I called customer service, and after the 5 min auto message and another few minutes on hold, I got an agent. I explained the situation and they gave me the numbers and we ended the call.  I then handed the numbers  to the desk agents, who typed it in and told me the number was still not correct, and I needed to call again.  At this point I really didn't know what was wrong, so I ask if one of the 2 desk agents can call and explain the issue to Iberia support.  They tell me that I have to call, so...
Call 2 - I called customer service, and after the 5 min auto message and another few minutes on hold, I got an agent.  I explained the situation and I asked for all the ticket numbers (both passengers, both legs of the journey).  The agent gives me the numbers - I ask them to stay on the line, but was hung up on.  So, I gave all the numbers to the desk agents (again) only to be told (again) that the numbers are not correct.  I ask (again) if they could please call for me to explain and resolve they issue.  They refuse (again).  So. .
Call 3 - I called customer service, and after the 5 min auto message and another few minutes on hold, I got an agent.  I explained the situation, and was put on hold for about 15 min.  At this point the desk is closing down (the flight was set to leave in 30 min), so a supervisor came by.  She called Iberia support and after about 2 min we have our passes and are making our way to the plane.

"Really bad handling of cancelled flight, systemic errors",Madrid,London,Europe,"My connecting flight was called in Madrid, and - despite being automatically rebooked for a next flight - everyone needed to que to check in, as check in via app wasn't available. 
They have a queuing system - so you need to get a ticket in order to beeing seen. There are multiple option to select from - business class, flying with children, disturbed flight etc. If your are honest, and select the right option - disturbed / cancelled flight - they do not call you number. All the desks take Business class as priority (A + number from queuing system). No other letters + numbers are being called AT ALL. 
Me and a few other honest people waited until everyone else was served, and gone, and still no D numbers were being called. 

I enquired a couple of times about it - saying that I'm waiting 1.5h and not being called, just to be told to wait, that it was ok. 
Eventually the last few of us HAD to take new tickets, saying that we are in business class (A+number) to be served! 

Being asked / challened about why that is, they said they don't have to serve me, because I'm not business class, and it all other passengers fault (?!). There was none else left, as they still didn't call my original D ticket. 

It was like being in the world of Monthy Phyton absurd reality. 

Quite shocking - being punished for being honest, and made to be nearly later for another flight (they only checked me in eventually, after I agrued)

Worst Airline!,Madrid,Los Angeles,International,"I took a trip to Spain & flew Iberia round trip. The flight to Spain went well, however the seats were extremely uncomfortable & barely padded. I have flown on an economy airline with more comfortable seats. The in flight service also was so-so, with such a long 10+ hour flight, I typically get multiple offers of water or beverages, with Iberia I did not. 
However this is not the sole important reason I would not recommend this airline nor EVER fly with them again. Upon my flight home, Iberia booked me with a 55 minute layover at a different city in Spain. My flight to the USA ended up being almost an hour delayed due to inspections by the pilot. The flight home was similar to the flight there as far as the comfort & in flight service. However spoon arriving at my destination, I was told that my luggage did not make it on the plane due to the “quick” layover that Iberia scheduled for me. I ended up getting 
my luggage back 2 days later. 
I have been in contact with the airline regarding compensation (EU law has passenger rights in that airlines must compensate passengers) to which the airline is responding in circles stating I have to upload documents that were already sent. All I asked was to be refunded the money I paid to check my luggage, a request they denied. 
I will NEVER fly Iberia again & will not advise any of my friends or family to fly with them or their partners. If you’re flying to Europe stick with reliable airlines such as KLM, United or Delta. You don’t want to lose your luggage or sit in an uncomfortable plane, it’s not worth it!!",October 2018,"November 19, 2018",1.0,,,,,,,,
First and last time,Madrid,Santiago,International,"This was my first time flying with Iberia in a transatlantic flight. After my experience, I don't think I would repeat it. The following are my impressions:
Check-in & Boarding: I was not able to do the check-in online, so this means that as I needed to buy and extra baggage, I had to pay the overrun for do it in the airport. Boarding was so disorganised, with a lady shouting out at the gate to queue according to the group in our boarding pas, which in mine was not shown, a complete mess. Due to the boarding disorganisation, when I reached my seat, all the upward compartments were occupied, at the point that cabin crew allowed me to put my stuff in one of their compartments.
Food and Beverage: very poor and not the best quality, also limited in variety. Nothing was offered out from the established meals, say, snacks, drinks, etc. 
Customer Service: the crew attitude was not the best, being not friendly and showing no care about the customer service. The feeling was that they just wanted to finish the flight as soon as possible.
Cleanliness: I only used one toilet and it was not in good conditions. Also, any type of hand lotion and/or refreshment towels were provided.",November 2018,"November 19, 2018",2.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0

Why I will never fly with Iberia again,Buenos Aires,Tel Aviv,International,"I was flying from Buenos Aires to Tel Aviv with a connection in Madrid, having a little less than two hours between flights (both of which by Iberia). As the plane was getting ready to take off from BsAs, we were informed that a technical problem is going to delay the flight ('poquito'). Turned out that poquito was a little over 1.5 hours. Ok, I thought, better hurry up when the flight lands, and I should still make it - Iberia will probably delay the following flight by a few minutes, right? None of the stewardesses informed or inquired about passengers with connections, but I was still optimistic. I hurried to the connection as soon as the plane landed, along with a few others in the same situation. We made it, just minutes before the flight was scheduled to leave, plane and crew still at the gate. Needless to say we weren't allowed on. I would expect the airline to delay the second flight on their own volition (and indeed I've seen it happen before), even 5 minutes would have been enough for us to make it (without the baggage, obviously, but that's still better than missing the flight).
Off to customer service. After doing some checking to see which flights are available, the Iberia rep issued me and a few friends alternative tickets to TLV via Zürich, by the airline Swiss. Ok, we head off to collect the bags and later to check in for the next flight. My bag is there, my friend's bag is not. We wait for a bit. Mind you, this was already more than two hours after our flight landed. Waited some more, still no luggage. Unhelpful Iberia representative only says ""it should arrive soon"". As it was getting high time to check in for the next flight to Zürich, he had to leave without the bag.
And now for the pinnacle. When I arrived at the check in, the clerk informed me that the connection flight Iberia put us on, from Zürich to Tel Aviv, is in fact overbooked, and I don't actually have a seat! I would have to fly to Zürich, and seek out the transfer desk to be issued a different flight yet again, leaving me in no better position that I was in Madrid. Of course, the Iberia representative mentioned none of this - she plainly said I have the tickets. To say I was shocked and pissed off is an understatement. It's almost as if Iberia simply wanted to pass the responsibility to another airline, at the expense of my time. (by the way, as it turned out, by a bizzare case of bad luck the flight to Zurich was _also_ delayed and I missed the connection regardless of the seat issue. The the Swiss costumer service was top notch.)
I should also mention another separate incident which occurred before the flight itself, but since this is already fairly long I will just say briefly - I was charged 260$ for changing the flight date, despite the fact that the website clearly says the fee is 100 euros. No one at the Iberia desk could explain to me why that is the case.",,"November 18, 2018",1.0,,,,,,,,

They also gave us a faulty incomplete passengers rights, which omitted our right to receive back part of the money of the flight. This is incredible!

I will make every effort not to fly this airline again.    I did try to purchase more leg room, I am one of those travellers over 6 foot, however the much-vaunted linkage with BA/Iberia/American Airlines does not actually exist - and it was not for not trying on my side.

Going more like low-cost at high price,Canton of Geneva,Madrid,Europe,"Lately I was taking quite often flights with Iberia, but this time it was total disappointment. First of all, the flight was in economy at the price of business - over 500 euros. And separately I was obliged to pay luggage. And you understand, when you fly within Europe at this rate you are not expecting them to be so miserable. Now, the seats in the aircraft are not changing position anymore. Actually, new seats are couple of cm thick to earn space and money. Food and water can only be purchased - total low-cost concept. But the worse was at check-in. First time in my life I was first person to check-in on this flight. And Iberia ground personnel was obliging us ( with my wife) to check in hand luggage ( with computer and fragile articles). She was very rough, almost angry with us. I didn’t understand her as we paid two suitcases and used only one. We were the first to check-in, but she behaved as we were the last passengers and it was her last chance. So, quite bad experience this time.",November 2018,"November 11, 2018",2.0,,,,,,,,
Great Iberia Flight,Rome,Chicago,International,"We flew 2 legs on Iberia, 1st leg was Rome to Madrid. It was an early flight at 7:40, we took at 170 kph taxi ride from central Rome to the Airport at 5:00 am. The line for Iberia was quite long. Luckily we had Business class and there was a check in for Business Class that had no line. We hit the lounge for an hour before departure. 

Upon arrival in Madrid we had to go through a mini immigration when we changed buildings. The airport in Madrid is very modern and clean. We had almost 2 hours between flights but by the time we went through the mini immigration line we only had time for a 1/2 hour in the Business Class lounge.

The flight to Chicago was on an Airbus 330. Our seats were in business class and very nice. The service in the business class cabin was outstanding. The flight left Madrid around noon and it was 9.5 hours to Chicago. The wine really flowed on this flight and we had 2 meals. The food was only ""ok"" but the service was outstanding. 

After the first meal everyone settled down for a nap and the cabin stewards asked for the window shades to be pulled so that you can watch movies or sleep. About 2 hours prior to landing a lady next to me decided that she would be the only one on the plane to open her window shade and the sun was scorching me through the window and it really was an irritation because we were dead tired from getting up at 3:30 am.",October 2018,"November 11, 2018",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

The worst vegetarian meals ever....,Guatemala City,Madrid,International,"Off to a bad start, I booked online and paid for a expensive economy seat in order to ensure the special meal option.  No facilities online to order the meal, had to phone the Spanish Customer Service number, operator listened to the fact that I still ate seafood and was ovo-lacto.  He recommended the Hindu Meal.  It was the most unapetttising meal I have ever been offered on an international airline.  No salt or pepper, apparently Hindus don't season their food, no cup for tea or coffee, no bread and the list goes one. The best part was the grey lump of fish and the huge pile of white rice that was to have been my main meal.  Iberia and many other airlines need to start taking us non meat/chicken more seriously.

Worst Veggie Meal Ever,Madrid,Quito,International,"I thought I had gotten the golden ticket, when I was allowed to book premium economy for my flight from Madrid to Quito (for work). This was my second time on an Iberia flight, and god, it was awful.
First the good points: I am quite tall (1.80m) and I have very long legs, and the legroom in premium economy was perfectly allright. However, that's about it.
The service was rude and unfriendly. I asked for headphones and was lectured by the flight attendant that I had to wait my turn, but not in a nice, but extremely rude way. 
The veggie meal was HORRIBLE. As usual, the ""ovo lacto"" vegetarian option was actually the vegan option, but the vegan option that is also the diet version. If you are anorexic, go for it. I got rice with no sauce, and some vegetables, no bread, just crackers, and some transfatty margerine, the fruits were nice, surprisingly enough. then, at some point, I got a salad with nothing else (whilst meat eaters were fed properly), the salad was tiny, the dressing extremely bland (but greasy), and again, nothing to accompany it. Later on, I got a sandwich, with - you'll probably work it out - salad inside, white bread with salad. So 0 protein in 10 hours. Luckily enough I was aware of the fact that this might happen, and had 2 cheese sandwiches with me, which saved me.
I mean, I am absolutely happy to have a vegan meal, but give me some protein, allright? The amount of food you get for 1.500€ is ridiculous, and outright bad. 
Other companies have learned and now offer protein (hummus, stuff like that) for vegans, so taking a vegan meal on airlines that seriously care about their customers can be a positive surprise, because very often they really go for the healthier options.
Seriously, if I can avoid it, I'll never fly Iberia again. The combination of having rude flight attendants (did I tell you that they rolled their eyes when I asked for orange juice, coke, AND water, in order to at least make the tiny meal become bigger in my stomach) plus being hungry, and being stuck there for 10 hours was simply horrible.
At least they had a few films to watch.

His putting the seat back resulted in a domino effect along the plane leaving us with absolutely no back support for the whole overnight trip.
Service was awful. Rude and very unhelpful staff who disappeared for 5 hours leaving no opportunity to ask for water. All help requests were ignored and call lights switched off without answer.

Worst customer service of any airline ever traveled.,Oakland,Barcelona,International,"Worst customer service of any airline ever traveled.  Extremely uncomfortable seat.

They will tell you “ we do not have any “. Instead of saying “you did not pay enough for your seat in order to get the services.”  Completely disorganized when loading their airplane as well. Had to bus us over to the airplane and then let all of the buses go at the same time. Everybody went in different entrances. Some people sitting in the back of the airplane loaded in the front and people sitting in the front loaded in the back which created huge chaos.  When I turned my light on for the tenant come over to ask if I could purchase a water, she walked by and shut off my light  without a word . This happened three times before I got up and asked to buy a water when they told me I can only have a paper cup full of water.  They wouldn’t even let me purchase it. You couldn’t hear them speak on the intercom either. They said everything in English and Spanish but it was almost a whisper.

Outrageous seat selection fees not disclosed until AFTER booking. Nonexistent customer service!,Cincinnati,Amman,International,"I was routed to the airline to book after a Skyskanner search turned up the Iberia flights from CVG to Jordan and back from Morocco with overnight layover in Madrid for return flight. Not exactly a bargain fare, but better than alternatives on other airlines.  However, another airline would have been cheaper had the seat selection fees been added onto the fare!  So the flights were sold to me under false pretenses when comparing my options! Also, in choosing which economy fare to book, I chose regular vs basic economy for the outflight, as the comparison of the two did say seat selection would be extra for basic economy (that was the only advantage) and the price difference seemed worth it since seat selection was ""up to $40"" (though that was implied to be FOR THE ENTIRE FLIGHT EACH WAY, NOT PER LEG OF THE 3-LEGGED TRIP!).  I did choose basic economy for the return trip as the price difference was greater, so I was willing to pay an extra $40 for each ticket for seat selecton.  Much to my surprise, in managing my booking, a fee of $18-$37 was being charged for EACH LEG of the trip, on both the outgoing and incoming flights, for regular seats (exit rows are even higher)!  The only seats I was able to reserve for free are for the short ORD-CVG flight on AA, but NOT the AA flight out, from CVG-MIA.  Seat selection is not even available at a price for that flight.  I called Iberia to complain, in hopes they would assign seats for me.  When the agent tried to do that for the MIA-MAD flight, the charge was $37 and she apparently couldn't waive the charge though she admitted I had booked an economy flight, not basic economy, and that the only difference between the two is (supposedly) seat selection, which I was being denied!  I asked for a supervisor to call me back last night, which of course never happened, I have now been on hold with them for 20 minutes, no msgs stating how long the hold time is, or anything.  Now, in going to Manage My Booking, I see that the entire trip, all 3 legs, outgoing (the one I paid more for, for Economy rather than Basic Economy) now mysteriously says ""seat selection unavailable""!! That happened since last night, so now there isn't even an option to pay for them!  For the return trip (which I'd booked at Basic Economy, so DID expect to pay for seat selection, but only up to $40 for the entire trip, not 3 separate fees--well, for some reason the short AA flight was reservable for no fee, so it is the 2 Iberia flights now--of up to $37 each!!).  There seems to be no resolution to my complaint, I would have booked the Basic Economy flights the entire way, rather than a higher fare that was described as including seat selection, had I known.  Or chosen a different airline, entirely, at a somewhat higher fare!!  Presenting these fares side by side in search engines for comparison with higher fares that include seat selection, without an upfront disclosure, is highly deceptive!  Does anyone here have any suggestions for possible recourse?  And I am STILL on hold, wondering  now whether my number has been  coded to never get a response!

A hellish trip,Paris,Newark,International,"We booked on Expedia 2 tickets on Iberia from Paris Orly to NYC-Newark airport. less than 3 weeks later, Expedia sent us email: our Iberia flight would be operated by Open Skies. THe flight to Newark became IB2689. No further changes. However at Orly, where we had been ""told"" to get to check-in 4 hours early, we learnt Open Skies did not exist any longer or had transferred our flights to a company called LEVEL. Noboby had heard of them. Its checking counters were in a total chaos. No employee at LEVEL had any idea about how to check-in people. My husband and I finally were able to check-in and were given 3 cheats for 3 pieces of luggage going to Newark. The chaos continued at boarding, including for the pilot. I shall keep this incident for another day.
Now we got to Newark on time, nothing to report about the flight... But one piece of luggage was missing. 3 other people's luggage were missing too: one had come from Madrid through Paris to Newark, the other from Barcelona, the last I do not know but they were missing their car baby bassinet. Tima, an employee of LEVEL she said, refused to give me a complaint number. She did not give one to the other two passengers (I have their name and we plan to pursue the matter together). She said she did not know what to do except take our names and the  ticket for the luggage and gave us a phone number for IBERIA. . She became aggressive when I insisted we needed a tracking number. LEVEL does not have any organisation: we learn they subcontract to a Manhandling co. the opening of their check-in counters at Newark (7pm to 9pm) to coincide with the flight back to Paris, and ditto for boarding the flight later. in the next week, IBERIA kept insisting they needed a PIR number to track the whereabouts of the luggage (the code bar on the cheats could have told them... but no IBERIA at Newark and no LEVEL either. . My sister in Paris went to Orly and found my luggae had gone to Pointe a Pitre and would some day return to Paris!!!! to be redirected on a LEVEL flight to Newark. But no when.  we kept going to Newark every day for 6 days. Finally the person in charge of this Manhandling firm for LEVEL at 6pm when I located her in Newark showed me a picture of my luggage. At no time had we been contacted by LEVEL or IBERIA. No compensation offer of any kind. No apologies from them. No compensation for clothing we all had to buy, time lost, aggravation, meetings missed etc... NEVER FLY LEVEL.
oh yes... and no operating WIFI on board, even against payment... neither going nor coming back.... though we booked a ticket that was supposed to offer the service for a fee.

Never again any host came back during the flight to offer us another drink, not even water. Our calls were completely ignored. In the morning before the landing we were not served any breakfast. When we asked for it the hostess refused and reasoned that they had no obligation to be in that flight since it was so late in leaving.

Upon arrival in Munich, I found out, to my horror, in my cabin luggage, that the thick nylon thread in three of my unfinished necklaces which I was in the process of making was cut in the middle, and a finished pair of earrings was completely destroyed, its red stone torn off (Pictures were sent to Iberia). It was obvious that those pieces of jewelry were unfinished, so I cannot understand why they were slashed and made useless. I had an event to attend as soon as I arrived in Munich, so I had to finish some of them. Apparently, nothing  seemed to have been stolen, just destroyed.

Mixed Review,Los Angeles,Madrid,International,"LAX to Madrid round trip.  Long flight.  I had requested seats when I booked the flight and paid extra, but the airlines did not have record of them when we checked in.  Going was not too bad … left the gate on time, food was acceptable (not good), many in-flight movies and games to choose from, arrived in Madrid on time.  A reasonable experience for the flight.  My travel companion had asked for special assistance, but was left sitting in Madrid for an hour, maybe more.  She finally walked through the airport - who knows how much longer she would have sat there waiting for someone.  We found Europe wasn't much on accommodating special needs. 

The return flight was not nearly as reasonable.  The plane boarded 45 minutes late and left the gate about 30 minutes late.  We were seated 2 rows away from the toilets (again, requested seats not available) and the human and chemical smell was overwhelming about 2 hours into the flight.

many basic soft product issues,Los Angeles,Madrid,International,"We took a flight from Los Angeles to Madrid and from Barcelona to Los Angeles. The first flight was ok, I was not expecting much, but the return flight was so bad. The return flight is sold by Iberia, but it is operated by LEVEL. You can read the comments, which almost all of them are negative all over the internet. 

As for the Iberia flight from Los Angeles to Madrid, I would say the legroom was ok, the seat comfort was ok, the food was good, but could be a lot better with the proper choices. The cheesecake dessert was best among the other items of the meal. in-flight entertainment was good, there were enough movies, games, and music. We received free headphones and blanket and a cushion for the back.

The only and the most bothering problem was the service. I saw many itty bitty and sometimes very basic shortcomings that brought my satisfaction down. Just in 2 flights this is what I noticed that cannot be just accidental:

- one of the hostesses hit me almost everytime she was passing by my seat. 

- time to time the hit the cart to the back of the seat where the seats in the middle turns to 4 instead of 3

- the hostess pour coffee on my wife's hand

- I saw they dropped a coca cola can, yes, it was open

- On the return flight, while embarking a family with many members cut the entire line and once a senior hostess questioned them, they started to make a scene and there was a big miscommunication among the crew and then they started to pin the fault on each other etc, they could not stop the family and everyone was really pissed about the inability of the crew doing their job

- there were a couple of crew, a guy and a girl that were serving passenger in different aisles, they were making eye contacts and showing face gestures etc that looked so unprofessional and that was kind of the reason they were making mistakes, like hitting the seats, dropping things etc

- a passenger while asleep drop her chips can and people were walking and it was big mess, the crew did not try to pick it up and clean the mess a bit at all

-WORST OF ALL: on a 13-hour flight, people sleep and they cannot get out and disturb the adjacent passenger because they get thirsty. The cabin air is always dry and one needs to hydrate constantly. The cabin crew did not even badge to pass waters quietly during the sleeping time. I have flown many times and I have not seen any airline NOT do this. instead, every time I went to the galley at the back of the flight, they were chit-chatting and you needed to ask them for water. IBERIA NEEDS TO seriously consider some quality service training

Worst flight experience of my life,Granada,London,Europe,"Everytime I've flown with Iberia there have been issues with the flights. This experience has been by far the worst on flights to and from London. From Granada to London, I had flights booked in advance, with confirmation however I chose not to specifically reserve a seat. On getting to the check in, I was told I was on a standby list as the flight was overbooked and I would have to wait till the end of check in to see if I would be allowed on the flight. At the gate I was refused entry to the flight and told to wait while a member of staff ""sorted the issue"". I had to wait nearly an hour for them to arrange me new transit flights to Madrid and then onto London, but with a 3hr wait in Granada airport. This meant I had to cancel train tickets I had pre-booked. I was given a ticket to compensate for only €125 which does not cover the inconvenience and stress caused. Now 1 day before my return flight to Granada, having confirmed my 2nd flight I receive an email to say that my flight has been cancelled with no explanation given and no offer of compensation. Their website too, is completely useless as well as the staff on the phone seeming to have no clue what is going on. Will never be flying with them again and strongly recommend that no one else does either.",October 2018,"October 22, 2018",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
An absolute disgrace,Buenos Aires,Canton of Geneva,International,"I booked on the same day of my flight (but 12h prior to it) a ticket on-line. The system validated it but for no reason asked me to show up in an Iberia office with a form of ID and my credit card and this before midnight Madrid time. 
Being Sunday the downtown office was closed and the airport office did not answer for more than 3h (I was calling 5 different numbers). 
When I showed up, I had to wait another 2 and finally someone nice and friendly came and was able to issue a new ticket because the previous booking... had been cancelled when it was only supposed to be at midnight Madrid time. No explanation given.
In several occasions I called a (US?) number and the people there can only tell you what the system shows. They are polite but absolutely of no use what so ever.
So after wasting my last day of holiday trying to be sure that I would fly, I finally got to the gate. Never seen a circus like that in my life. Someone with me was flying business (I was flying eco) and he gave up even trying to see if there was a line for him. 
The plane to Madrid in eco was dirty almost from after take off and the crew not pleasant at all.

AWFUL - TO AVOID,Cusco,Venice,International,"Family of 4 adults, flying from Cuzco to Lima (with LATAM), Lima-Madrid and Madrid-Venice (with Iberia).

Flight MAD-LIM (IB6651) and LIM-MAD (IB6650): aircraft and bathrooms very dirty, on board service inadequate, terrible food.

Lima Airport: on-ground services inappropriate, rude personnel, difficult to communicate with because some of them spoke only Spanish. 
At Cuzco our luggages were boarded and we were told that we would have to pick them up at Venice. At Lima’s gate, Iberia staff told us that we should have collected the baggages at Lima (we did not of course), and that we did not understand what we were told in Cuzco, so it was our fault. At our final destination (Venice) the reclaim staff confirmed that the information given in Cuzco was right and Lima did wrong.

Final result: our luggages are still in Lima because of lack of communication between Cuzco and Lima airports and we were treated badly by personnel in Lima. I will avoid flying with Iberia again and advise against choosing it.",October 2018,"October 21, 2018",1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

You can make the bags in an hour.  I did not receive my bag for two days and they gave it to a courrier but did not advise me of that.  I had to spend hours trying to find it. On the way home we were told that our exit rows that we had paid for well in advance were no longer available and we were given two seats in the middle of four.  My husband is 6'6"".  He doesn't fit in the seat,which is why we paid extra.  They gave us the runaround and in the end no one did anything to help us.  Not only was his 9.5 hour flight miserable, but the woman in front of him could not recline her chair as his knees were jammed into her seat.  He had to put a magazine in between because the metal was digging into his knees.  There was an aircraft change.  They should have AT LEAST given us one aisle seat.

American tried to help me but couldn't because Iberia had to correct it 1st. When I spoke to Iberia, they would Not help me.

as long as nothing goes wrong,Santiago,Madrid,International,"The flight departured from Santiago to Madrid with about 1 hour delay, due to some wrong freight that needed to be unloaded: ok, that happens.
one of the offered meals was no longer available (I was sitting in one of the first 4 rows...); no Problem, can happen
breakfast could not be served, due to turbulences: ok, can happen
afte arriving late in Madrid and having to hurry to ge the Connection to Munich, I was almost sure that my luggage will not make it to Munich: can happen
arriving in MUC, the luggage was not there and baggage claim told me that they will deliver it to my place the next day
The next day, I did not get any Information, neither my luggage. Trying to reach the company that should transfer my luggage (found their contact on the Iberia web page) I had to find out that the phone number (only possibility to contact this company) does not exist...can happen and is normally no good sign.
Trying to contact Iberia (the typical game: if you want to purchase tickets, press one, if you want to...press two...) I had to find out that the service (baggage claim) is not 24/7. The next day (two days after arrival), I still got no Information from Iberia and I send them an email asking to take care that my stuff arrives until 16:00. The answer was that I should contact baggage Claim...very funny.
The bags have been at my place when I came home.
I am dissapointed about Iberias behavior (claim management) if somthing goes wrong. As long as nothing goes wrong, Iberia is ok but the Claim Management is substandard. And no, that was a low cost cheap flight.

"No customer service so no support if anything goes wrong - and it did, both coming&going",Palma de Mallorca,Madrid,Domestic,"In a 1-1/2 hour flight, Iberia let people stand and socialize in the aisle, and let kids run up and down the aisles all the way up until landing process started. While our bags were delayed getting to Mallorca due to missed connection, the bags made it to the Mallorcan airport 17 hours after we arrived yet Iberia didn’t deliver to us until 49 hours after we arrived. Both the hotel manager and I tried calling Iberia numerous times , dialing numerous numbers - all either discontinued or with looping auto message, no people to speak to. Ridiculous. Then on trip home, started boarding process then they stopped for over one hour with no information. Apparently Spanish government closed Madrid airport for some fancy air show to celebrate a national holiday. Okay, while not Iberia’s fault, they then lost my luggage. Twice in one trip. It went to Madrid with us but they failed to scan it so there was no record of it anywhere. With the flight arriving in Madrid so late, it never made it on our American Airlines connection and it was not on anyone’s radar. I had to ask American to send luggage information 4 times to Madrid before it was found, and I had to be my own advocate. American won’t “escalate” until it’s 5 days late.

Iberian Airlines puts employees before paying passengers,Malaga,New York City,International,"The first leg was Malaga to Madrid.  No one showed up at the gate to check in passengers until 5 minutes after the plane was supposed to take off.  After another 10 minutes they ushered us to a bus, which wasn't big enough to take all passengers.  The plane seated about 140 people, and we boarded from the tarmac.  When all of the seats were filled, the last two passengers, who had been brought over on a second bus, did not have seats.  They had tickets, but their seats were occupied by 2 Iberian pilots, who, we learned later, were flying home.  4 Iberian flight attendants were also seated on the plane. The 2 passengers had to make a connection to Miami and then a connection to Vegas.  All of the 6 Iberian employees refused to yield their seats.  After 30 minutes, the passengers were forced to leave the plane.  We were now an hour behind schedule.  Not once did the flight attendant ask if anyone had to make connections in Madrid.  When we asked about our connection, one flight attendant responded, ""we have to have faith"".  Needless to say, everyone on the flight missed their connection. There were no more flights to NY that day. We spent 2 hours waiting at a service desk, for our turn to get booked on a flight the next day.  When we left,  there were at least 20 people still waiting and there was a line of people at a second service desk.  Iberian filled a hotel in Madrid with passengers, paid for meals and transportation and made everyone angry.  Some people had business meetings and other work commitments the next day that couldn't be met.  One doctor had to cancel a day of office appts.  The person at the service desk was pleasant and helpful, but there was absolutely no excuse the what happened on the flight from Malaga.

Never take Iberia: they'll cancel your flight without telling you,Granada,Madrid,Domestic,"I saved the email from Iberia stating I correctly booked 2 flights: from Granada to Madrid, and a few days later, from Madrid to Barcelona. I went to the airport to take the first flight and was told the airline didn't charge me, so they canceled my flight. I received no notification of the cancellation.

The customer service rep could do nothing for me, other than reiterate what I'd already been told. When I told her I had to catch the flight, she charged me double the online price I'd received when booking in advance. When I arrived at my destination, I checked my second flight, only to find that had been canceled, too. When I called customer service, they played the strategy of ""we'll transfer her around enough, and make her wait long enough that she'll hang up."" When I tried to leave a complaint via the airline's official complaint you, I learned you can't complain unless you have a ticket number.

So the lesson is, if Iberia cancels your flight without telling you, you can't complain or ask for them to right the wrong.

Over 2 weeks problem was not fixed, so I requested an email address, they gave me one, to which I received a reply saying this email is only for medical matters, so called (again) and they told me to call luggage services, to which obviously they said it has nothing to do with them, was told to go to an Iberia desk, or in case of not having one close, an American Airlines or British Airways desk, I went there and I was told that they can't do anything, is all through the system and I had to call... Finally I got a 2nd email address, waited the 21 working days and called to get an update, and imagine my surprise, lady over the phone tells me that email address is no longer in use and I need to do the claim on the website... 
This situation is SO FRUSTRATING, I emailed the CEO and still no answer, I don't know what else to do to claim something that it is my right. They don't seem to care about the customers, don't show any empathy and I'm just very upset with the whole situation.",August 2018,"October 15, 2018",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
"No, no, no",Madrid,Johannesburg,International,"The service was so-so, but not worse than could be expected on a budget airline. However, the monitor in my seat was locked on the (very bright red) logo of the airline, and despite asking repeatedly, the flight stewardess and the flight steward did not address the problem. Never mind that I could not watch movies or anything else, the light from the logo was shining directly into my eyes from a very short distance.  Yet another flight steward did finally attempt to re-set the monitor, without luck, and since the flight was fully booked, moving to another seat was not an option.

I has to use my blanket to cover the monitor and sleep in the cold as impossible. Repeated requests for another blanket was ignored. 

To add insult to injury, on another flight, despite our having paid EXTRA to be able to choose our seats prior to online check-in, we found ourselves placed RIGHT AT THE BACK of the aircraft, and despite protests to the purser, we had to stay in those seats (our paid for - chosen seats occupied by someone else, and all other seats occupied) next to the aft galley, with flight stewardesses bumping into the aisle seat all night, with all the concomitant noise making sleep impossible.

A disaster in their own terms,Edinburgh,Madrid,Europe,"I travel by Iberia and had the worst experience from check in to on board service.

This was a 3hours flight and pilot just spoke once tosay we will be arriving 25 minutes late and he blame the ground services at Edinburg. He said it was a disaster

Worst Airline In The World,Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,Split,Europe,on 28 August my friend and I boarded a flight from Gran Canaria to Split with a transit stop in Madrid flying Iberia. The flight from Las Palmas to Madrid was fine but the nightmare started when we arrived at Madrid Airport. We followed the rule of always checking the boarding gate for updated details and the board indicated that we had to go to the Sattelite terminal to catch the connection to Split. We asked several people including people who worked there that we had to go to Sattelite terminal as indicated by the board. We then had to go through Immigration which seemed strange to ke as we were transit passengers. There were massive queues trying to be processed and airport attendants who were just rude and totally usless and who couod not even answer basic questions. After finally getting through to the boarding gate which clearly had a sign indicating SPLIT (Croatia) there was no one there. We then went to the Iberia desk and instead of trying to assist us they did not want to know about our problem instead blaming us and one staff member even swore at us. At this stage there was a group of young Americans who were also caught in this situation having seen the same boarding gate details as we did. We were then directed to other Iberia counters and were sent from counter to another and finally after some pleading we were put on the next day flight but we now had to stay overnight in Madrid at our own expense and we were told our luggage had gone to Croatia which was incorrect but this was conveyed to us by airline staff. Suffice to say this was a very stressful situation and it was made even worse by the rudeness and unprofessional attitude of Iberia Airlnes staff. I am still in shock at the treatment that we received. And Madrid airport needs to be held accountable for the service to clients.

Horrible Experience,Marrakech,New York City,International,"My experience with Iberia was horrible. Their customer service is extremely lackluster. My mother and I were returning from Marrakech and she was in a wheelchair and we had to get to a connecting flight, I asked the flight attendants to please contact ahead at the gate for the next flight and they did not and that started the whole problems as we arrived at the next gate we were told gruffly that the flight was closed and there was nothing that could be done. We had to go to the customer service desk for assistance and I expressed my concern for suitcases and was told it will be okay, again this was false as when we finally got back to NYC the next day our luggage was missing and when I finally got mine back it was opened and missing some cash and other items. I do not normally put cash in my luggage but it ended in it as it was in a bag that I fitted in my suitcase. I paid for premium economy and when they gave me the other flight to return to NYC they placed my mother and I in economy even though there were empty seats in premium economy another oversight on their part. I contacted the airline about the situation and they never responded just another negative in my book. I know that they do not really care about this but I decided to share this experience with the good folks here at TripAdvisor as a warning because being forewarned is to be forearmed. Be prepared for disappointment , they should be better as they are part of the One World Alliance and they were also supposed to forward my award points to American Airlines for the trip but did not even do that so another failure in my eyes.

Worst Duty of Care /service,Guatemala City,Madrid,International,"This was the worst flight and potential day of our lives . We boarded the plane in Guatemala and made a short stop in San Salvador where we went to the lounge and had a snack provided by the airline on way to Madrid . Shortly after takeoff my pregnant wife started vomiting from food poisoning and I followed about an hour or so later with frequent visits to the toilet . It was a red eye flight and we couldn’t sleep at all , my poor pregnant wife couldn’t even stomach water for the whole 10+ hours which was extremely worrying ! The staff gave us little to no help and we asked for a doctor and escort when we landed because we were both too weak to carry ourselves ,The best we got from them was an airport map . What a failure in Duty of Care ! 

We had to struggle ourselves to the information desk where they quickly got the airport medic and a wheelchair for my wife , they than helped us through customs and barge claim as we were too weak to do it ourselves . 

I was told to write a complaint to the airline which I did asking for compensation for the medical costs and flight expenses and this response was the best they could do ! ( pictured below ) .

We are both emerald One world flyers and Gold with Qantas so this is the reason we booked this partner airline because we expected a similar service .

One person in our group required a wheelchair which we had arranged but because our flight was late coming in, the wheelchair was not delivered and it took us a very long time to find our way through the Madrid airport to the gate for departure.  It's very difficult to get through the Madrid airport quickly because you need to take a train from the ""arrival"" building to the ""departure"" building.  No one spoke English, employees were rude and unwilling to help us.  Ample time should have been given between flights and it wasn't.

Never again,Madrid,Casablanca,International,"I have never flow this airline so I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was the polar opposite of what I am used to. 
Boarding was terrible. Just finding out where I needed to go was impossible. I was told you cant know any information until maybe an hour prior to your flight so we were stuck in an overcrowded airport , in the dark about everything.
Once we got to the boarding area, it was a nightmare. Another hellish time trying to get to the horrible overcrowded bus then climbing up the steps to the airplane, which was the worst. The steps were very steep, wide open-easy to slip through- and overall nearly impossible with carry ons. I had my taken my mom's cane so she wouldnt have to hold it trying to climb up and no one gave a damn about forcing a handicap senior to risk it all thanks to protocol. 
The landing was so BAD, we all thought we were going to crash. We barely made it safely, forced into the seats in front of us (with seatbelts fastened) and objects under the seat flying up several rows. I found electronics at my feet that belonged to people much further back. It was not only a terrible situation, but a scary one at that. 
The seats were so small and cramped together. You had no choice in seats and even when booking on the same receipt you had no choice and were separated which makes no sense. For a 2 hour flight not once did anyone come around and offer you even one drink. The aisle was so tiny you could barely walk down without hitting everyone in their seats. There was just no way to avoid it (and a I am very skinny). Even so, i took up the entire seat with no room leftover.

Disregard for your luggage,Barcelona,Lisbon,Europe,"Iberia takes your carry-on and stores it. It is then a “free-for all” right next to the aircraft  to redeem your piece.  There are no check systes in place. So when your luggage is not there and there is not a piece left in its place, is lost luggage an “inside job?”
Odd how that the Tumi luggage with the “Go-Pro” inside has still not turned up.

No remorse, no apology and another agent rebooked us on a flight and we are arriving at 3:15pm instead of 11:50. We are on a tour.

I called Iberia on the phone and the customer service agent in reservations said that the flight was only delayed by 20-minutes. How can their computer not show them anything and I was referred to go back to the ticket counter whereas we have passed security already. Another bad customer service!

Sometimes you can get to there and sometimes it requires many stops,Dallas,Paris,International,"When seeking business class with miles even when booking months and months ahead- sometimes a circuitous route is the only one available.

American to MiAmi was ok but Iberia definitely had better food, and I was surprised as all get out that my Madrid to Paris flight was fine. Going back on Iberia, Nice to Madrid to Miami was lovely tho they kept the cabin a bit warm. Also, without global entry you might not be able to catch your connection! Miami airport is probably the worst airport in the US and I would do almost anything not to have to go thru there again. Signage (just like CDG) is wretched!

I guess everyone had given up, because nobody was approaching the desk. Ten minutes later it was my turn but there were no available seats.

Madrid airport Iberia staff provided wrong Gate number. could not care less for all of us missing our flights,Miami,Dubrovnik,International,"I have been traveling with Iberia airlines on numerous occasions and overall pretty satisfied with the service.
That is up until, Sunday Sept 30.2018 
Essentially, Iberia airlines provided a wrong gate number for my connecting flight from Madrid to Dubrovnik on Sept 30th 2018 and what happened next is beyond any customer service and I personally am appalled by Iberia airlines staff at Madrid airport. 

so here we go;
I flew from Miami to Madrid and had a connecting flight to Dubrovnik, Croatia with about an hour between arrival and departure. Being in good shape and with boarding passes in hand from Miami I made it to the gate stated throughout the screens and on the boarding pass - S 38. Moreover, a nice gesture from your part is a representative as we disembarked the plane for all express connecting passengers with new envelopes and boarding passes with gate info.
To my surprise, upon arriving to designated gate at the time of boarding stated on boarding pass there was no one  there, screen showing Dubrovnik boarding and doors to linkway closed and locked. Shortly after other passengers show up with same gate number but still no one from ground personnel around. All of us connecting flights I might add. (Chicago, Miami, Brazil...)
There was no plane connected to the link and still no one around. Again, the screen said boarding for Dubrovnik and correct gate on the boarding pass. I eventually found Iberia airlines representative at the nearby customer service desk and explained the situation. He followed me to the gate and basically said he could not do anything (service fail 1). Could not contact anyone or find out where the plane and the gate actually were?? This was now 15 minutes prior to departure time. At that moment a phone rings at the desk and representative has a conversation in Spanish. After about 10 min of phone call he informed us that the plane has to go and Captain decided so. Our luggage would be offloaded and we had to collect it and proceed to another customer service desk where they should provide us with alternative flights. I asked if someone can accompany us as there were 8 of us and were bounced from desk to desk, as this clearly was not our mistake but Iberia airlines ground operators'. we were at the designated gate at the designated time. He said no, he cannot accompany us or provide any further assistance. He told us to follow baggage claim sign and after we collect our luggage to look for customer service desk. This took us another hour to get our luggage as we had to explain at 2 different counters what had happened. (Service fail 2)

After retreiving luggage we were told to go 2 floors up to Iberia ticket sale counter. Of course, again we had to explain why we are there etc... the gentleman redirected us to another counter as he could not help us. Again explanations are in order and all of them do not speak good english. This was now at another Iberia ticket sale and overweight luggage counter. the lady at the counter stood there looking very confused after we explained why we were sent there etc... I asked if she needed our boarding passes and if she can call a manager for us. She collected all our boarding passes and said would try her best to assist us with another flights. That we should wait for about half an hour. We waited for over an hour and another blond lady steps out and said we will have to fly to Barcelona and then to Dubrovnik and would be able to reach Dbv by 9pm - a whole day delay. (Did not catch her name but I asked if she was a manager and she said yes.) Now is a good time to mention that among 8 of us was 80+ year old woman. Standing by the counter for over an hour as there were no seats available some of us sat on the floor. still no boarding passes or any explanation as to what happened and why we were given wrong Gate number. this manager told us to wait there again. 15 minutes later we finally asked again if anything is sorted and one of the representatives was surprised no one approached us. Finally someone shows up with vouchers and told us we are flying to Venice now??? first and than Dbv. At this time I asked if we will be getting any kind of vouchers for a meal or a bottle of water. The lady said no even after I pointed out an old lady among us. Then i asked for the manager's business card or a manager to come out. As soon as i asked we could literally see the manager running from back office towards the elevators and disappearing. Seconds later another man comes out saying he is not in charge of this area and that the manager is unfortunately out at the moment. If it was not sad it would be funny. (Service fail all over)

Anyway, I was  writing to Customer relation straight from the airport as I had couple of hours to spare, waiting for my flights paying for my lunch and hoping that somenone from IBERIA ground operators would be at the gate this time. I lost a full day because of wrong gate number provided by Iberia airlines.

never received any reply from them or explanation or apology or compensation (remember I asked only for a voucher for meal and a bottle of water )",October 2018,"October 3, 2018",1.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0

Heaven help you if your flight gets cancelled!,Madrid,Los Angeles,International,"My flight was cancelled at the last minute. Really: we were already at the gate. Now, I realize that things happen (and if there's a problem, I would much rather have it dealt with on the ground rather than in the air!) but, honestly, the customer service people acted like they had never had a cancellation before. No information was given other than 'Stand here' or 'Wait here.'  There was not a word of apology (rather, they acted like it was our fault for wanting help), nothing was offered in the way of water, food, or even vouchers for same. American Airlines (my ticket was booked through them) put me on the same nonstop flight for the next day but others weren't so lucky and ended up with layovers in Miami, London, New York, or Mexico City.  I still waited at the airport for over SEVEN hours (with only the floor available if I wanted/needed to sit down) because I was told that, if I didn't apply that day, I would forfeit any hope of compensation. I finally made my own hotel reservation (because I didn't for a moment trust Iberia to help) but still had to wait all that time for someone to TEAR A FORM OFF A PAD and hand it to me. We had been told we had wait was because it was necessary for them to input information into the computer but apparently not.

Basically, the Iberia staff acted like they had no idea how to handle the situation - AND THEY DIDN'T CARE.

I love Spain, I have visited many times, and I will continue to visit. But I will NEVER fly Iberia again, if I can help it.

That said, the flight attendants (once I was actually on the plane the next day) were lovely and helpful and very nice.  But heaven help you if your flight gets cancelled.",September 2018,"October 3, 2018",2.0,3.0,3.0,,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0

So is everyone flying on BA4270 getting their seat when they show up at the counter??

Bus journey as only alternative to cancelled flight!,Madrid,Alicante,Domestic,"We flew London Heathrow to Madrid (with BA), same parent company as Iberia, to take a domestic flight on down to Alicante. It was showing as late on the board and was then cancelled due to 'technical problems'.  We waited patiently for Spanish speaking travellers to get information, we asked ground staff if they could tell us what was happening in English, on said 'yes, I'm busy now' and walked away.  Desk staff huddled, away from the desk so we couldn't get them either.  We relied on English speaking Spanish travellers to tell us what was going on.  Iberia ground staff were telling travellers to go from one 'customer service' desk to another, gradually moving us through the airport to a public bar where we had to wait...for a bus.  It took over 5 hours for what was a scheduled flight of about an hour.  No food or water on board the bus, we did stop but refreshments were at your own expense.  No one from Iberia to meet us at Alicante airport, and when we asked how to make a compensation claim no one seemed to know how to respond, other than it was someone else's job.

Our return flights through to London were both Iberia, never again.

During all this extraordinary debacle, we wrote to Iberia Air asking for an explanation, and what compensation would be provided: to date, there's been no response.
Remember, these people flew from Australia to Portugal, and arrived here with NO luggage at all. They were able to purchase minimal replacements, but it was extremely stressful and disappointing - for all of us.

3 hour+ flight without food or drinks,Copenhagen,Madrid,Europe,"We were generally disappointed with this airline. We were 180 people on the plane that day, it was a busy day, and the staff chose to go through the cabin with one food trolley. We (my friend and I) were sitting in the back, but since it was a 3 hour flight we expected to be able to get something to drink or eat (and celebrate our short holiday)at some point. That never happened. They were so slow, so when they reached the finale 3 rows, we started to fly into Madrid, and we never got the chance to order anything. 
It seemed that there was a passenger, who was ill. Half of the trip we could see that some of the staff were standing and talking/helping some passengers in the middle of the cabin, so that might have taken up a lot of their time. But then they should inform the other passengers. We would of course understand. 
In general the information level was very bad. Only a little around take off and landing, and it was very hard to understand. 
Also there was very little space for your legs, you could hardly move and there was no net, where you could place a few items.
So it was just disappointing. 

We flew with Norwegian on our way back to Copenhagen, and it was just 10 times better: Super nice staff, very informative (and most of the flight the info was given in 3 languages and with a very clear pronunciation), food/drink trolley came by at least 3 times even though the plane was also very full, and since we were a little late, they also helped the passengers, who were transferring to other flights in Copenhagen, leave the plane quickly.
There was more legroom and a net for your things. 

As a last comment there was also the issue with our hand luggage. So there is a general problem with airlines giving travelers the opportunity to bring a small trolley as hand luggage and not needing to check it in. But at the same time, they don't have the necessary space for all these trolleys. Iberia basically begged us to check in the hand luggage because the plane was full, so my friend checked in hers. With Norwegian we were asked if we wanted to (so it seemed like a service), but it wasn't necessary, and it wasn't a problem on board.
 
So it's just all the small things. I know how crazy the competition is with airlines, and when you choose low-cost, you often get what you pay for. But there is still a big difference between these airlines, and I've always been happy with Norwegian. I think it's important that airlines still keep a certain level, and that you have a good experience when flying. You need a smile, some legspace and a minimum of service. I have better service with Norwegian on 1 hour flights to Berlin than I had on this 3hour+ trip with Iberia to Madrid.",September 2018,"October 2, 2018",2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0

HORRIBLE,Chicago,Dubrovnik,International,"We recently flew from Chicago to Dubrovnik with a connecting flight in Madrid.  Our flight from Chicago to Madrid was delayed by almost 4 hours due to a mechanical problem.  Really?  You couldn’t get another plane...this is American’s hub and you are partners.

Anyway, we were going to miss our connecting flight in Madrid to Dubrovnik and asked the gate employee what to do.  She said, “Don’t worry, when you get off the plane, someone from Iberia will be there with an envelope containing y our new itinerary.”  Never happened.  In fact, we got to Madrid, waited in a customer service line for about 1 hour and were told we needed to go to a ticket counter.  So, off we went to a ticket counter who re-booked us from Madrid to London and London to Dubrovnik but the on the following day.  Not acceptable...She found a flight from Madrid to Venice and Venice to Dubrovnik.  First leg on Iberia, Last on Austrian Airlines (so she told us).

The flight from Madrid to Venice was the most awful flight I’ve ever been on.  100% full, seats were so close to ones in front that my knees were actually indented for hours after the flight.  Attendants didn’t serve refreshments or snacks.  And, they were pretty nasty.

The flight from Venice to Dubrovnik was very enjoyable!  It wasn’t Austria Airlines...it was Croatia Airlines.
It was a Bombadier propeller plane, su per comfortable seats, tons of leg room and we were served FREE snacks and drinks ...even alcoholic ones!!   That’s right, alcoholic beverages and snacks for FREE!!

Slightly Let Down,Madrid,London,Europe,"After my outbound flight to London I did consider giving this airline 5 out of 5 for excellent service and punctuality, but unfortunately this review has now been hindered by a disappointing return jouney that I just had.

On arrival at the airport things went very smoothly where I dropped off my bag with no trouble and was even very well guided to my boarding gate. However when economy class was asked to board there was no organisation of the queue and people got confused as to what line they had to join as 3 lines for Economy formed.

Even after all that chaos suddenly we were told to move to another gate so a stampede took place at the airport and even then we had to wait another hour before boarding took place so therefore the flight got delayed.

Once on board though on both journeys I took I found the seats comfortable and the cabin crew were one of the most friendliest I had seen. However I would strongly suggest they organise themselves better and not hurdle their passengers around like mindless sheep.",September 2018,"September 29, 2018",3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0
Premium Economy,London,Sao Paulo,International,"After having an average experience on the business class I was a bit anxious before flying on the Premium Economy. But I think the experience was better to be honest.
I sat on the 11a seat, the very first line of seating with a huge leg room.
The seat was good. Leg room wonderful (11A), reclinaton more than I was expecting, the feet support was nice (I thought it wouldn't TBH). Passengers receive a kit with basic toiletries and a welcoming drink (OJ natural or water, no alcohol option). Food was ok: the main dish was really tasty, I had chicken with vegetables, but sides and dessert were not as good. Wine was nice. Breakfast I thought was quite ok - croque monsieur (really nice), Greek yogurt, juices (this time -  nectar) bread (cold and hard and offered twice), Kit Kat (yes, Kit Kat), oats cookies...the only let down was the juices :( I don't like sugary juices.
The service on this flight was away much better than my previous one. The crew was helpful and pleasant. The cabin manager was fantastic, she helped me to overcome my fears during a strong turbulence (well, maybe strong for my taste LOL). After she came to see me and offered me support I even managed to sleep for a few hours! I am very thankful to her! 
An overall a great experience. My only suggestion would be to allow premium economy passagers to use the same toilets that business class use, as it is right in front of the area. It's a bit annoying to have a toilet right in front of you and you need to walk all the way back to use the other toiltes and usually waiting in a queue.I think it would be a nice ""plus"".",September 2018,"September 29, 2018",4.0,,,,,,,,

What a Mess of an Airline,Boston,Madrid,International,"• The website is pretty horrific UI-wise, and did not persist our passport info, so we had to go deal with the desk when we got there
• Their mobile app is 5 years behind all of the other airlines, and you can't board unless you have a physical boarding pass
• Did not delay flights when there wasn't enough time for a connection. Upon landing, they displayed on the seat entertainment system that there were 3 Iberia connecting flights in 35 minutes (so, Iberia knew they had almost an entire plane trying to connect). My friend and I had to go through customs and security (running in between) and we still missed the flight. There was also a couple frantic families behind us, so pretty much everyone on our flight missed their connecting flight.
• We were given standby tickets for the next flight without issue, however standby actually means ""you need to politely harass the desk agent for 10 minutes"" because we were put on the flight at the last minute. Had we not bugged the desk agent, there would have been two empty seats on the plane we were on ""standby"" for.

The flight itself was fine, good legroom for economy. The on ground experience was so horrific I wouldn't reccomend this airline to anyone though.

Lost my luggage for the entire 10 day trip and reimbursed crap.,Paris,Madrid,Europe,"My flight was originally on Delta from SLC to MAD for both business and pleasure.  Due to Delta leaving 3.5 hours late I missed my connection in Paris and as all the Delta Partner flights were booked going down to Madrid that evening they put me on an Iberia flight.  This gave me a 4 hour layover or so in Paris so you would think my luggage would have arrived.  It didn't.  I figured it would show up a day or so later because how do you lose luggage for longer than that and I made the mistake of only making only one pair of underclothes and two shirts in my backpack.  As the days progressed with no luggage I was told by Iberia to hold onto my receipts for reimbursement as I had to by clothes I could wear for my conference, makeup and some clothes for the vacation portion of my trip.  I didn't go wild.  Finally, on the 9th day of no luggage they contacted me to say it was found and now in Madrid.  That didn't help as I was in Barcelona.  I instructed them to send it to my home in Utah to which they told me they would send me the shipping information.  They never did.  Three days later there was a knock at my door at 4:50 a.m. that freaked me out because I wasn't expecting anyone.  It ended up being my luggage.  Luckily, it was all there.  Unfortunately, the story doesn't end there.  When the Iberia representative told me to hang onto my receipts he gave me an email address to send all my documentation.  I did so knowing that reimbursement could take up to 30 days.  After 3 weeks of radio silence from Iberia I contacted them to check the status and they said they never received my paperwork!  They gave me a new email address and I resubmitted again. This time I saw emails from them saying they were processing and I could expect a check in approximately 30 days.  Fast forward to this week.  At day 36 I called them and was told that they couldn't help me.  That I would need to lodge a complaint through their website.  I immediately did and received an email that said it could take up to 21 days to respond.  When I got home that day there was a check in the mail for less than half of the amount submitted!!!  I've since contacted them without response.  The customer service of this airline is unbelievably horrible!  Do not ever fly with or recommend them (unless you really hate the person).  =)  I book a lot of travel for the software company I work with and will never direct any business their way.

The website wasn't working well, after spending an hour I finally managed to fill in my complaint. A month and a half later I had no answer. I tried to access my complaint online, it didn't work. I called them : no agent can check the status of my complaint, or even take my name or complaint number. the complaint department doesn't talk to customers. They tell me that if I didn't have an answer it is because my complaint was rejected. What kind of company doesn't even reply to its customer when themselves do a mistake?! Since there are no ways to contact the complaint service, they tell me to write a new complaint... what a joke! I would have to write a new one on their non-working website and get no answer again if they decide it doesn't apply to their criterias.

I was forced to stay the night in Barcelona. My problem is with the food I was given as compensation. It made me physically ill, as I was served a sandwich that had undoubtedly been sitting on the line all day waiting for me. The hotel was substandard. May as well have been a public toilet.

Disgusting. The next morning I started my day with fresh vomit and [poop] coffee. Thanks for the poison, Iberia. I’m glad I resisted the free beer or I may not have made it to Vigo.

I cannot believe the treatment we received,New York City,Toulouse,International,"I usually avoid writing  bad reviews - for many reasons. In this day an age it is easy to punish people who have tried but came up short. But our experience on Iberia should be a warning to other fellow travelers who may consider their services. 
We had a flight from JFK to Toulouse with the connection in Madrid. This was a start of our holiday exploring the beautiful South-Western France.
Our connection in Madrid was very short - only 1 hr and 15 min. In the retrospect I understand that they should not have sold us this ticket - the travel time between the terminals - as marked by the signs - was 28 minutes already!
No gate agent was available at the arrival to navigate us through and help us find the easiest route to our gate. Also other airlines helped their connecting customers to pass through the passport control faster - but Iberia agents were not to be found. To make long story short, we arrived at our connecting flight sweating and panting - we run the whole way - just when the plane was pushed off (no one wanted to give us 2 minutes grace either). 
And then came the insult. When we got to speak to a customer service agent at the terminal, she told us that we had plenty of time to get to our gate and it was all our fault that we missed our connection. none of our explanations - or our sweaty faces - mattered. Following that she mentioned that she does not have to do anything for us as our missing the flight was due to our negligence. She gave us seats on the last flight of the day and made it look like she was doing us a great favor. The attitude was really unbelievable!
Instead of enjoying our first day of vacation in France, we spend it in Madrid airport. Mind you in US we do not have very long vacations in general. It did hurt.
The final bit of irony was that, when we arrived in Toulouse we found our bags not on a belt but in  a segregated area. They flew our bags on our original flight without us being on the plane which is a violation of the aviation rules.

Better than expected,Boston,Madrid,International,"The overall flight was good.  Boarding in Boston was an unstructured free-for-all process.  This could be much better if set up like the gates in Madrid with separate lines for each boarding group.  Chose and paid extra for bulkhead seats to provide extra leg-room and avoid having a passenger in front of us from reclining into our space.  Worth it on a 7-hour flight.  Two meals were served during the flight.  Both pretty good.  I hate seeing reviews slamming airplane food when they are comparing to land-based restaurants.  They are serving 350+ hot meals at 35,000 feet.  These guys did an admirable job.  Plenty of in-flight entertainment, including a couple dozen movies from which to choose.  They also provided 1 hour of complimentary internet, which is plenty for checking emails and sending some text messages.  If booking non-cancellable tickets, be sure to read the details.  There is no forgiveness and the change fees are steep. We also flew two intra-Europe flights on Iberia which were also nice.",September 2018,"September 23, 2018",4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,,

Once they couldn't fix the in flight entertainment i've asked them to change my seat and they said there were no seats available but then i had a look at the business class and it was empty.

Therefore, I booked a flight a few days later from Madrid, for myself and my wife. We also booked hotels, etc... When I called to cancel the last leg, they told I will have to spend €600 for that.

We were in complete shock and disbelief when we walked in the plane and saw that all the seats in both business class and economy were exactly the same size, our business class seats weren’t any wider and didn’t recline more than economy seats, so we got ripped off paying more than double.

Not what we were expecting....,London,Johannesburg,International,"Travelled to JHB in August via Madrid.

We got to the airport on time but the plane didn't take off until 7.15pm!! Which was most annoying. They seemed to have combined two flights together(?) The check in was a nightmare. We needed to go to the 'family' queue as you are unable to check in online if you have children travelling with you. There was not enough desks to cater for the travellers. At check in there was many phonecalls placed to allocate us a seat. In the end our seats were split with my 8 yr old daughter boarding card showing she is about 8 rows behind us! When we boarded the plane the air hostesses insisted that passengers need to sit according to their allocated seats. My daughter has an allergy and we chose vegetarian meals but when our meals came they were not. On the return flight it was the same issue. The connection in Madrid wasn't great.

Iberia Cancelled Flight 2hrs Before Departure-So Far Zero Compensation,Paris,Rome,Europe,"We had an evening flight booked to Rome from Paris along with a hotel for that night near the airport in Rome: Our cruise was leaving from Citivechia the next morning. Iberia cancelled the flight with almost no warning. We had to scramble to find another available flight on Air France which still didn't leave until the next morning. Air France called Iberia, but they refused to cover our tickets which cost about $350 Euros! (Versus the $80 Euros we paid for the Iberia flt). We lost the money for the Rome hotel which was too late to cancel. We had to sleep (or try) in the Paris airport (with floor buffers and construction going on all night!). We ended up out around $900 Euros over this cancellation along with a lot of stress and discomfort.

Good Airline - needs to work on seat assignments,New York City,Split,International,"Iberia is a good airline with budget available pricing. The interior of the aircraft was much cleaner and well maintained than I expected. I flew them to/from JFK and Split, Croatia recently and the customer service was decent. My flight to Croatia the staff were very friendly and helpful, but on my way back there were at least 2 of the flight attendants that seemed to have an attitude any time you asked for their help even if it was a simple question. The entertainment selection was very nice and broad as well with a good selection of new movies.

The only con I had to flying Iberia is that they do not seat you together or anywhere near others in your party - especially if you all booked together on the same ticket/credit card. There were 3 of us travelling together and we booked our flights altogether, but we sat no where near one another. We were all adults so we just dealt with it, but there were SEVERAL families on our return flight with small children that Iberia booked them in seats all over the aircraft. How can you allow a small child to sit by itself on an international flight and not with their guardians/parents?! Our flight was delayed leaving Madrid (our layover stop) back to JFK because so many people were bartering with one another to switch seats so their children could sit with them. It was very disappointing to see this. The gate agents would also not move people around prior to boarding as the general excuse was, ""this is a full flight"".. my opinion too bad families, especially with small children, should all be allowed to sit together.",August 2018,"September 18, 2018",4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0

Not that you can't talk on a plane, but it was louder than other flights so much so that it was noticeable. Like non-stop talking the entire time. The other thing that happened on both flights were there were large groups of teens flying together and they did not sit down/sit still/ sit frontwards/ move when people tried to pass in the aisles and no one, especially the flight crew, seemed to care.

"Business Class Good, not perfect",Madrid,New York City,International,"Business Class on Iberia is definitely a leap up from economy, and well worth the price. On a trans-Atlantic flight, every comfort becomes that much more valuable. Blanket and pillow, roominess, ability to fully recline, comfort pouch (lip balm, yes!), free noise canceling headphones... the list goes on. Not to mention the food and wine. If I can afford it, I’ll never fly economy again. And getting off the plane to Immigration entry first is a bonus, too.

So, why not five stars? Iberia dispenses with the little touches that are totally unnecessary but make the business class experience that much more fun for us unseasoned travelers. No welcoming champagne or cocktail. No warm nuts or chocolate chip cookies. And no real shmoozing with the flight attendants. Those perks may be tedious to the regular business-class traveler, but for those of us for whom upgraded flying is a real treat, well, I want it all!

The flight attendants don’t Caret for the passengers and is basically a take it or leave it.

Just getting worse,Chicago,Madrid,International,"I have been traveling to Spain now for over 40 years.  Most of my travel there, I try to take a direct flight which basically limits me to Iberia (American airlines uses Iberia to travel to Madrid).  I use to love Iberia... the food was excellent, the wine was great, the bread was fresh and always had second servings.  As the years have gone by... I have noticed this airline has just become average.  My recent travel to and from Spain was nothing to really write home about.  The food was average, the bread seemed old, the wine was okay.  But this could all be accepted except now I notice the bathrooms are just horrendous.  The bathrooms smelled like urine!  I had two children with me and hated having to go to the bathroom with them.  I accetes it as a mistake when we went to Spain, but to have the same thing occur on our way back just was awful.  
Some positives:  the crew was wonderful.  Very polite, brought the food for the girls first, and even held the food for us when they were sleeping.  They had smiles and seemed to enjoy their job. 

Unfortunately  I feel that Iberia is not to worried about customer service or improving their airline as other companies do.  It just seems to be worse and worse throughout the years.

We called and got some feedback because it was an employee only number but finally we were given a ref # to give to the service desk. After a half hour we were told that we might be all set and to get in the long  check in line.  We waited an hour in line and finally got up to the counter where we were told that we were only on a waiting list.

First and Last,Los Angeles,Rome,International,"Flying in the States, you become accustomed to a certain type of order, and way of doing things.  It started with us trying to pick our seats online, and we could not.  Once we got to the airport, the line at the counter was ridiculous, so we assumed that we would be able to change our seats with the gate agent, as that's what we were told we could do.  Not so.  There was only one gate, and no gate agent until the flight was about to board, so we had to go back out to the counter, which was another long wait.  We also needed a preboard as we were traveling with my husbands parents, and they just told us they really don't have a formal one, but to stand in a certain spot and they would let us on.  When it was time to board, we had to fight for our ""spot"", and once we finally got through, we had to wait for a very late flight crew.  The wheelchair assistance team told us that they are always late.  We found this to be true our entire trip.  The flight itself was okay, the seats are very tight, so if you can, definitely upgrade to business class, but that is limited.  My only other complaint was that I am allergic to aspartame, and my husband is allergic to pork, so needless to say, I really couldn't consume any of the beverages on the flight, and my husband was given a sandwich that had pork on it, and was told it was not.  Thank God, I caught it, because he would've stopped breathing in the air.  Iberia got us to Italy and back to L.A., but next time, we'll fly American.

TERRIBLE TREATMENT!,Zagreb,New York City,International,"As I sit here on the Iberia Airlines flight from Zagreb Croatia to JFK, NYC, after a fantastic, peaceful holiday with my four siblings, I am compelled to get this story off my chest. 
In a few days, it will be the one year anniversary of our dads passing. The five of us decided to go on a vacation to be together to honor our dad. His family was everything to him. He was our ""rock"". A true saint on this earth and we miss him terribly. 
There are actually other reasons we felt we should do this; some of us have health issues and others-personal issues, that we felt we needed to be together in support and love. 
As I mentioned, our holiday was just what we could have hoped for. We are all still very close and love each other very much, even after all these years!! I'm the youngest and I celebrated my birthday of 59 years yesterday!
We all decided we would pay $130.00 US extra to upgrade to premium seating on the long flight from Madrid to NYC...a big splurge for all of us, but we figured, what the heck! An email came through with this special offer a week before the flight and we all agreed to ""go for it"". We will all be together and dad would want us to feel special. 
Fast forward to today and the first ""red flag"". We never received a confirmation email from Iberia Airlines confirming our flight and allowing us to check in online. We arrived at the Zagreb airport 3 hours early to make sure everything was in order. Second red flag, for some ""odd reason"", none of our boarding passes would print out on our second leg from Madrid to NYC. We were told by the ticket agent, ""not to worry"". They could print our boarding passes when we arrived in Madrid. From here, things seriously took a turn for the worse. We had less than 45 minutes to get from our arrival gate to our connecting gate, which was in a totally different terminal! There was no way we would have made it on our own so we were put on a shuttle, along with 14 other passengers that were on the same flight. 
They rushed us through so quickly, we didn't have a clue what was going on...until we got on the plane, where they told us, ""Oh, so sorry. This is a different aircraft and three of you are in the back in economy"". Are you kidding me? Just like that? I feel we probably got bumped to economy seating because someone else paid more money and/or we were late getting on the plane, through no fault of our own. 
Ok. So maybe I sound like a whiney baby but this was a really big deal for all of us to be together...one of our dads last wishes as he passed. 
I think the worst part about it was the lack of care and concern from the crew. They truly didn't care and told us to go to customer service at Iberian Airlines when we landed in NYC to deal with it. Yeah right. Just what I want to do after flying and traveling for 16 hours, with a 2 1/2 hour drive home from the airport.  It would have been nice if they even acknowledged what had happened but instead, ignored the three of us in economy. 
This review is so long because I obviously have a lot of time on my hands (a 6 1/2 hour flight), of which I am trying desperately to deep breathe and ""let it go"". I have to admit, this is helping to get it off my chest!
I would give this airline a rating of ZERO, if that was possible. 
I was actually warned about their customer service prior to booking the flight and read other reviews, which were horrible. I took a risk. I shouldn't have. If you're smart, you'll heed my advice. I strongly suggest you book on another airline.",September 2018,"September 16, 2018",1.0,,,,,,,,
Where is my luggage?,San Francisco,Madrid,International,"I flew with my daughter from San Francisco to Madrid. She is going to school in Sevilla. The flight over was HORRIBLE! We knew that the flight would be crowded but we were not prepared for the events of the flight. The woman behind my daughter would not let her recline her seat and, even after repeated request to her and the attendant, we were forced to verbally confront the woman. She was causing quite the scene and Iberia personnel were a complete lack of help. During the flight, someone vomited in the aisle and the Iberia people didn't even clean it up! They just covered it with newspaper! The food was bad; doesn't even get 1 star. After 11 torturous hours, 
we got to Madrid and discovered that they lost our luggage. After numerous phone calls to people who were of no help, I finally went to the airport and found 1 bag. It had been there for two days and no one called to let me know There is still one more missing suitcase missing and it has been two weeks!

WHEN will my suitcase be delivered to me?,Barcelona,Valencia,Domestic,"My suitcase was not loaded onto flight I travelled on Wednesday morning. It was reported immediately to Groundforce at Valencia who advised not to phone till following day. 
Thursday no luck on morning call but later advised it would arrive Valencia late afternoon and be delivered next day.
On Friday late in day received an SMS to say it would not be delivered Friday but the next day.
It is now after 5pm Saturday and suitcase still not delivered. We cannot reach anyone at Iberia Airline by phone or Cacesa Mensajeria who we are guessing might be the courier company used by Iberia Airline.

All I can say is that after travelling from Australia I am totally disappointed and disgusted with the lack of assistance and service provided to me by Iberia Airline. All my clothes and essentials are in the suitcase and, considering the fact that the flight takes 55 minutes, it is beyond belief that I am still waiting for the suitcase to be delivered AFTER 4 DAYS when it never left Barcelona Airport !!!!!

Rough beginnings but smooth sailing,Zurich,Tel Aviv,International,I landed in Zurich from the USA with me medical alert dog. She alerts me to a potential serious medical condition and I take appropriate action before i or anyone else can be hurt. She is therefore very much required in cabin and not in a kennel. At Zurich Iberia seemed to understand it even though it was not in my record (American Airlines failed to inform them and they booked my flight). Iberia however is equally at fault as I telephoned and was assured verbally that it would be no problem.After a few minutes though the folks at Zurich said it was all fixed and I went on my way. The flight was GREAT. Everyone on board was super nice to me and the dog. I arrived for my next day connexion from Madrid to Tel Aviv. and lo and behold they do not take medical alert dogs in cabin. Absolutely under no uncertain terms will this be acceptable. After requesting a supervisor I was again told I'd have to purchase a kennel and put my dog in the hold. I called American Airlines panic stricken. Iberia supervisors also told me to wait. After over an hour and a half (glad I arrived early) Iberia told me it's okay and she could go in the cabin. American Airlines was ready to comp me on another flight in a few days so I could buy a kennel if necessary. Both airlines told me it would be fine in November when I return to the USA that the dog is expected in cabin. ...fingers crossed.

The Spanish Disgrace,Porto,Berlin,Europe,"Failing to on-board luggage happens. It’s a pain and frustrating, but it takes the exquisitely incompetent people at Iberia to turn it into a nightmare. Here is a list of the methods I used to try to talk to them or their handling agents (aeroground):
Phone 
Email (company and CEO Luis Gallego)
SMS
Twitter
Facebook
Linked In (CEO)
If they could ignore it, they did. If it made a noise and disturbed their siesta they answered and then hung up. Finally, after 5 days, they accidentally answered but claimed they didn’t know what country it was in. 
Eventually, in desperation, I went to Berlin airport and refused to leave until they went through their mountains of luggage (who says Germans are efficient?) I got it back.

Fly Iberia and Ruin Your Holidays!!!!,London,Alicante,Europe,"In summary, just don't fly Iberia!  

The first issues was checked luggage.  Tried to add 1 piece in the hold from Canada, not allowed.  The travel agent tried too, not allowed.  So to the gate at Heathrow to pay 110 dollars Canadian to check one piece of luggage.  Not allowed by the BA software either. Finally they go it on after a very long time, a very skilled supervisor and waved the charges.

Onto the gate.  If you have been through Heathrow, you know it is a zoo at the best of times.  So the gate announcement is purposely withheld until 10 minutes before boarding!  A mad rush when it is posted.  But wait, there is more.  Iberia declared a full flight and forced the the low ticket class to check the hand luggage.  Guess what?  The Iberia program would not accept and luggage for the hold.  So Mr BIG threatened no check hand luggage no fly.  So he erased the one piece in the hold to put both in the hold.  He said he erased the piece in the hold, then said he could not put anything in so just go ahead with my hand luggage.  The flight did not seem full to me.  Five empty seats. 

Guess what? No luggage in the hold on arrival -- it really was erased.

Iberia has no time or day to delivery, just stay at hotel and wait for them. Nothing.  Back to the airport five days later.  They have it, smashed beyond repair.  So make another internet claim and wait for the delivery to deliver a suitcase.  Gave them a local number and asked to text before delivery.  They must know that I have no access to internet except in the city so they emailed  me twice, that delivery would occur sometime.  In Spanish.  So four days later they give ME a phone number to call.  

Iberia has a system that works for them, not me, and requires me to sit and wait all day to serve them instead of be out and enjoy my holiday, which cost a lot per day.  If they deliver.  A Pox on their house.  And now I will have to replace the suitcase out of my own money.",September 2018,"September 13, 2018",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0

My suitcase was robbed. No compensation given!,Madrid,Valencia,Domestic,"I have travelled to many places but in my trip to Spain, it was the first and last time I used Iberia. Long story short.. one of my suitcases was opened. Shoes, handbags and a watch was stolen. Upon arrival to my destination (Valencia) I realized my bag was opened so I made a claim. The airline asked me to provide receipts of the things that were stolen.. how ridiculous is that! As I did not have receipts, they told me to buy the things that were missing from my bag and to provide receipts,so they could reimburse me. So I went ahead and did that. Now it's been over 6 months and Iberia hasn't give a coin! Every time I call them to check on the progress of my claim they say they are about to pay me but there has been a delay as they are migrating to a new software.

18.5 hour delay with no compensation and still no status report,Madrid,Buenos Aires,International,"About 4 hours after the plane departed form Madrid-Barajas Airport, our plane had to land in Gran Canaria, Las Palmas due to a passenger requiring medical attention. After landing in Las Palmas at around 02:00AM, the passenger was removed from the plane almost immediately to receive appropriate care. Meanwhile, the rest of us were onboard the plane for approximately 2 hours due to refuelling of the plane. We were notified there was a problem with the refuelling system and that they were trying to fix this. At 04:00AM we had to leave the aircraft and enter the airport, collect our baggage and only 2-3 members of staff were present. I had no idea what was happening as no-one was speaking english; it was just a very unorganised situation that seemed like no-one knew what was happening. There was at least 4.5 hours of waiting until eventually at 08:30am we were taken to a hotel, where we were still unclear about when the plane would depart. At the hotel, I had to constantly linger around reception to ask for any news...then finally after lunchtime we were taken back to the airport to board our flight. This resulted into my arrival in Buenos Aires approximately 18.5 hours late. I had to re-organise my airport transfers and was almost at risk of missing the first day of my tour. I also lost out on my only free day in Buenos Aires. Many of us filled out a pink complaint form at Gran Canaria, Las Palmas and Iberia sent an email on the 14th April 2018 to say they would respond to my complaint within 21 business days. It has been 106 business days with still no response from Iberia. I required written confirmation from Iberia Airlines to state why there was a delay for insurance purposes. I tried to contact them in June but they don't have a general email for enquiries, only an email specifically for Iberia Plus customers. Even if you try and email the Iberia Plus team, you simply receive an automated response asking for your Iberia Plus number. I tried to call the customer service number and the person answering was quite rude and unhelpful. He told me to go to website and lodge it as a new complaint, but there seemed to be some problem with the actual website because I couldn't actually file the complaint.

Iberia is an unethical company,New York City,Rome,International,"My wife had emergency surgery to clear a 90% arterial blockage to her brain ... 12 days before our scheduled flight to Rome from JFK with Iberia.  Minimum recovery time is 2 to 3 weeks.  We can’t make our trip to Rome.   

We had purchased non-refundable Premium Economy seats totaling $1897.82 for 2 adults.  The change fees are $275 per person plus any fare difference. 

After Iberia made it clear they would not refund us, I tried on several occasions to change our flights online to a later date (and pay the $550 change fee--$275 x 2--and any difference in price) only to discover that Iberia is rife with deception and unethical pricing practices:
1.  I found that Iberia has two sets of prices:
     a.  the lowest fares are available only online to customers and NOT to Iberia Telesales staff.
     b.  Only MUCH higher prices are available to their Telesales employees.  The lie
          and deception is that Iberia tells the public, on their web site, that Telesales Staff have access to the ""best fares"".  The complete opposite is true.  Their Telesales staff do not have access to the lower, online, fares.  
     2.  When I tried to change my flights online (and pay the $550 penalty for 2 adults) I realized that we were about to be charged prices consistent with Premium Economy seating but we were being forced into Economy class even though Premium seats were available!  I confirmed this lockout with Telesales who told me that if I want to rebook again with Premium Economy seating, that can only be done with the Telesales team.  And if you re-read point 1 above ... that means that the price I got from Telesales was higher than what's available online as a new purchase.  The price I got from Telesales to change our flights is $3,300 when those same dates and flights and seats are available as a new purchase for $1867.  Mind you, that $1867, would be offset by a credit for the similarly priced tickets we already paid for, and that would work out to be a wash.  We should only have to pay the $550 change fee.  Not $3,300.  

As I processed all this and tried to understand why this chaos was occurring, I ended up spending over 3 hours on the phone with Iberia Telesales reps over the last few days.  Sent them numerous emails. 

Finally, their Telesales staff told me they read my emails and that given my wife's medical condition and the frustrations of the last few days I just needed to take the medical proof (Surgeon's letter, etc.) to the Iberia counter at JFK Airport and the counter agents there would give us a full refund. 

You can see where this is going, right?  The counter agents at JFK today were besides themselves not understanding why Telesales would tell us something that was untrue: Counter agents at JFK cannot give refunds.  We were right back where we started.  

We are now 2 days from departure date and face the possibility of losing almost $1900 and not being able to use that $1900 to rebook with Iberia due to their unethical pricing system.  

I've contacted VISA to dispute my charge with Iberia and I've informed Iberia I will begin publicizing their despicable practices on the Internet.  I'm now demanding a refund from them.  If they don't comply, I will take them to Small Claims Court.  

If you have any advice for me, please offer it.  Thank you and I strongly recommend you look for another airline.",September 2018,"September 8, 2018",1.0,,,,1.0,,,,

It was over 24 hours before it finally arrived back in the states which complicated things for me as I was traveling again quickly.  While I understand these things happen, the customer service for Iberia at Logan Airport did not exist. We were unable to find a representative when we landed in Boston and fortunately a very nice woman from Swiss Air helped us out.

1) the website doesn't accept your credit card so you have to call to book. Happened to me 4 times this year. Or go to the airport physically and book like it's 1985... Happened to me once this year.

You easily waste 1h on the phone doing that... I won't mention the taxi costs to go to the airport ONLY TO BOOK!!!

2) Even if you buy a ticket with the explicit mention that you can pick your seat in advance, it doesn't save the seat when you book. Then you cannot change it online. On the guy on the phone tells you you have to go BACK to the airport to do that!!!
Happened to me twice this year.

3) Customer service agents on the phone are disrespectful. One of them literally YELLED at me (which prompted me to write this review btw). Seriously, wtf...

4) they unilaterally cancel your return flight if you missed the first leg...BUT they tell you that you have the option to buy another seat on the same flight you already bought a ticket for. WTF...

Cleanliness:  when I get on an aircraft and it already is a bit dirty, I really wonder.  Are the cleaners too rushed?  Not enough of them?  It's discouraging.  Not to mention the toilets which were ok, but again, could be better.

Ventilation:  I got an allergic attack halfway to my destination.  Was not sick---was reacting to something in the a/c system.  Better filters?  Clean the filters?

Food:  I appreciate being served food.  Thank you.  But if Iberia is going to serve food, it would not take too much more to actually make it good.

When we finally get our luggage, we go back to check it in and get our voucher for a whole $13 for lunch even though we would be spending lunch and dinner in the airport. The only thing keeping us going with an Iberia flight was the customer service letting us know that we would receive a refund for the tickets once we file our case. One month later and our request for a refund was denied! We waited 8 hours in the airport, cut our trip in half, and are expected to do all of that for free, let alone the stress and frustration it caused. This was by far the worst experience with an airline. We are still dealing with the company to get our refund, but this is completely unacceptable and I urge you all to fly on any other airline.

the worst experience,Los Angeles,Madrid,International,"as a travel agent I'm used to deal with issues with many airlines, but this has been maybe the worst I've had
My clients had a flight that I booked directly with the airline and bought a separate ticket for their daughter ( 21 years old)  at expedia for travel agents, received the confirmation for both and everything looked good. 
On the day of the trip, my clients arrived at the airport 4 hours before the scheduled time for the flight and the nightmare began... they were notified that their flight was cancelled due to technical issues ( I received an email from the airline around the same time) 
After some craziness at the airport my clients were relocated on a flight next day at 6:00am and their daughter was supposed to flight at 8:30am
Dad departed on flight at 6:00 am on time, and daughter went to check in at American Airlines desk , when she learned that she wasn't on the passengers list ( I received an email from Iberia the night before where she was confirmed on the flight at 8:30am )
Agents at American said that Iberia never paid for her ticket, Iberia said that it was AA problem... and that if she wanted to fly on that flight she had to buy a new ticket that cost $3,000 in that moment.
Long story short: after arguing with Iberia, thru Expedia support after 4 long hours ( Iberia also wanted to blame the passenger saying that her ticket was lost because she didn't check in on time the day before when her original flight scheduled, which was a huge lie . So after 4 long hours she finally was located in a flight to Madrid on that afternoon . She spent 14 hours at LAX ( from 4:30 am till 6:30 pm ) and now that I'm trying to get some sort of compensation from the airline for all the trouble they were put, Iberia is saying that the claim was supposed to be done on the same day of the original flight.... 
I've read the passengers rights on Iberia's website and it is not specified anywhere when does this claim has to be done. 
Hope this airline honors what it is promise on its website",August 2018,"August 23, 2018",1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2.0
Never Again,Madrid,Boston,International,"We flew this airline on our return trip from Madrid to Boston. I have no complaints with the flight itself. The plane departed on time, the seats were comfortable and the flight attendants were nice and attentive.
 The problems started when we landed and they could not locate our luggages. 
I traveled with 3 other people and they lost each one of our luggage. After numerous calls to customer service, we finally got a live person only to be told our luggage was sent with American Airlines via LA to Boston but they could not confirm which airport has our luggage.

AVOID AT ALL COST!!!!,Montreal,Paris,International,"After spending a week and countless hours trying to communicate with customer service representatives, getting hung up on and getting treated like i was just a number, i would like to tell anyone looking to book a flight with Iberia to AVOID IT AT ALL COST!!! They have the worst, most inhuman customer service, they do not wish to help or assist you and all they are looking to do is make that extra buck of you. Supervisors can’t assist u, they do not have managers and the representatives are robots.
I called to change my flight after an unexpected event occurred and I was told that the penalty could be waved considering those circumstances once i had new dates picked. I was also informed that if you had booked a basic fare for example and you changed it to a basic fare no surcharge would be applied. All those were FAKE PROMISES. I called back today with my new dates.... Surprise surprise, i was told nobody can wave the penalty fees (that is after waiting for 2hrs to speak to someone and getting hung up on twice....) not even a supervisor, that there is a surcharge on my tickets and that the total cost to change would be the same amount i already did pay for my tickets 1300$!!!
It is beyond ridiculous and even insulting that an airline acts in those ways. 
Once i told them i would think about it, they asked if my original plane tickets that i have PAID FOR (that are for tomorrow) could be released so they could sell them again if i couldn’t make!!!!! How OUTRAGEOUS!!!!!!

At the beginning, there was a delay of an hour, then it turned into 2 and at the end hostesses (or whoever, I don't care) told us the flight was cancelled! I had to go to Copenhagen and they didn't care about providing me a flight from LAX to Denmark, even with a lay-over and I spent an hour talking to a person who told me they couldn't do anything, I could just have complained online (that's what I'm doing right now, for the record).

Disappointed,Caracas,Frankfurt,International,"Although I had paid 40€ extra for a better seat the 10 hours from Caracas to Madrid were unbearable and I did not know where to put my legs (was it really a bettter seat?)
ONE SUGGESTION: In Economy it should be prohibited to the passengers to recline their seats because in the older planes with their worn-out seats the passenger in front who reclines his seat practically is lying on your lap.
The food was almost uneatable (Lasagna).
Worse on the connection flight from Madrid to Frankfurt. We were not even offered some water since IBERIA now is imitating the cheap airlines where you must buy everything for an exaggerated price. No water after crossing the Atlantic for quite a high price?
It could have been expected that my suitcase was not transferred to the connection flight with only one hour betrween the flights.

Sadly, Iberia lost both our suitcases, and when mine finally turned up, it was so badly damaged I will need a replacement. We are still awaiting my wife's suitcase.

Luckily we managed to get on the plane and shortly after we sat down the plane took off. All went well until we arrived in San José and heard that our luggage was not there. They promised to bring it to our hotel the other day. They did for the others in my companionship, but my bag was not there. For four days the Iberia staff kept on saying they didn't have it, they gave it to some company who had to bring it to our hotel. But the staff of that company said they had never received it. Terrible, what do you do without the sanitary essentials and having only the clothes you are wearing? So I bought new stuff. And then on the fourth they the Iberia stuff apparently saw the light and sent me a text message that they would bring the luggage to the hotel I was staying then. And they did.

Completely disgusted with this airline,Madrid,Seville,Domestic,"I live in Spain and try my best never to use Iberia as they constantly disappoint whenever I travel.  In the last three trips from abroad they have lost my luggage during the connecting flights within Spain, either Barcelona or Madrid to Seville. On one occassion I had to wait three days to receive my belongings.  A week ago my family was travelling from oveseas and when they arrived with an hour to get on their flight Madrid to Seville, they were told it was too late to board.  Never mind that my 81 year old father was also travelling.  They refused to put them on another flight and were told to wait a day and pay for new tickets.  My sister talked with three persons including a manager and she was just told to take a train.  That evening, my sister gets an email that the family's return flight from Seville to Mardid was cancelled as they were a no show.  We were up until 3 am talking with Iberia reps and they said that was their policy.  Of course it was, they were able to resell five tickets.  On top of that my sister demanded as to why she was not informed at the airport that their flights would be cancelled when she was speaking to the manager to which they said, it was not required to inform her.   Please, if you can, do not travel with this airline.  They have no respect for their passengers and are rude beyond belief.  When you try talking to them they tell you to stop talking and listen, something which they themselves do not comply to.

Iberia - the worst airline company ever,Athens,Lisbon,Europe,"My family and I chose Iberia to travel from Athens to Lisbon this Summer. Three days ago and in order to pay the extra for the luggage on the Iberia website for this flight I was informed (without any previous notice) that the hour of this flight was changed (from 4:50PM to 02:05PM) offering only the possibility of canceling this flight or accepting this new flight hour. Assuming that there is no choice, I accept this new flight hour. At the same moment, I realised that I could not take this flight because I have a flight connection (from another airline company) from Crete to Athens and I would have no time to take the Iberia flight. I reach once more the Iberia web site just in order to solve the problem and realised that, after all, Iberia mantains the 4:50 flight from Athens and the cost of changing the to it would be more than 1.900 euros. In order to avoid this payment and to take this 2:05PM Iberia flight that I was forced to accept, we have to arrived one day earlier from our holydays, by ferry boat and give up from the Crete to Athens flight (which was no refund). Total costs (no refund) 1062 euros:

- one night less in the hotel: 160 euros
- ferry boat tryp: 225 euros
- taxi to the airport: 120 euros
- flight from Crete to Athens: 557 euros

Dissapointing trip,Madrid,San Jose,International,"On our first flight to San Jose, the service was adequate and a fairly satisfactory flight, however, upon arrival in San Jose, almost half of my group’s luggage had been abandoned by the airline in Madrid! This meant the first three days of their 10 day trip were spent with NO clean clothing, this is absolutely unacceptable in 2017. The inflight meals were average and IFE was surprisingly good on both flights. On our return journey all aspects were ‘average’ with the cabin crew making no real effort to make our 10 hour journey more manageable, but I do feel drinks services should have been more frequent. Overall, Iberia is certainly not an amazing airline. The experience onboard was nothing terrible but the baggage horrorshow and the hour wait afterwards absolutely shattered my experience. Due to this incident occurring and the lack of care Iberia staff gave to us (it’s customers) in San Jose, I will not be flying Iberia again and cannot recommend anyone else to do so.",October 2017,"August 17, 2018",2.0,,,,,,,,
DON'T DO IT!,London,San Jose,International,"Iberia - where do I begin.  We'd booked a cruise departing from San Juan.

The first flight to Madrid knew we had a connecting flight and we were told someone from Iberia would meet us and take us through passport control quickly  This did not happen.  

You cannot believe the stress of this.  The customer service help desk was absolutely awful and took two hours to be resolved, that is all I can say. The staff are rude and unhelpful.

Don't understand how Iberia can stay in business,Los Angeles,Madrid,International,"Giving 1 star, but wish there was a way to give 0 or negative stars (black holes instead of stars would be nice), as any star implies better than our actual experience. Flew Iberia in spring 2018 to Madrid as group of 4 (2 couples). Bad start as boarding passes for all 4 of us were for seats that didn't actually exist on the aircraft. Actually went thru gate scan of boarding passes and got on plane to find seats didn't exist (and we had paid extra for seat assignments. Head flight attendant gave us equivalent seats, so not a big deal. 

But then things got exponentially worse. On arrival in Madrid, only my checked bag made it. Stood in line for over an hour to file claim for missing bags. Pleasant agents, that were not in the slightest hurry. Opened claims for the missing bags, and agent said web site would give us status updates. Web site completely useless; just said ""Tracing continues"" for next 5 days. Tried many times calling Iberia baggage service. About 20% of the time, phone line would disconnect in the phone tree or while on hold. Another common occurrence was line would get answered by IBeria+ customer support, who clearly was uninterested in helping a non IBeria+ customer. Once even got agent that said could not help us, could take 2 weeks to find the bags, and just hung up. When did get to agent that would at least look for updates, got nothing more than the web site status. 

American Airlines flew the first leg of our trip to Spain (SFO to LAX), so tried their baggage service number. AA was exceptionally helpful, checking the baggage scans and determining that the bags were scanned by AA in SFO and LAX, and then by IBeria in LAX before disappearing. They also explained the process for what happens to bags that haven't reached their owners (after 3 days they are accumulated in central location where a group works to reunite with their owner; after 21 days, they are considered lost forever).

Late on the 4th night without the bags, a call to IBeria got the same no new status response. With a call to AA though, was told the bags had been found and were actually on a flight to our next destination (Lisbon). Couple hours later, got a text from Iberia stating the same. On 5th day, we were finally reunited with our bags.

Unfortunately, Iberia was not yet done with us, however. After 2 days with only the clothes and sandals she was wearing on the airplane, my wife broke down and bought a change of clothes, pair of shoes, toiletries, and a jacket. We filed a claim with Iberia for reimbursement. First, it is hard just to figure out how to file a claim. Madrid baggage agents gave us a web site link to use. The link is inactive. Searching Iberia.com web site, must go to Contacts link, then thru a side menu, and then to a  Complaints link to file a claim. The claim can only have 3 attachments and under 5MB. Had to do multiple scans of the receipts and other docs they wanted to manage to squeeze into these requirements. 

About 4 weeks later, they started asking for more info. I provided everything they wanted, and followed up with a call a few days later.. Each time, they stated they never received any response from me, sometimes giving a variety of possible reasons (e.g. attachments must have been too big, server down at the time, I must just reply to their email rather than copy their email address to To field, something wrong with my email address, among others). With the dozens of times I have sent replies to them in multiple ways and using a different email address, none of their reasons are valid. They also refuse to let me speak with a manager, saying they have no way to transfer the call. The email address they provide for escalation gets no response. I am still in this fight; no idea how many months it will take to actually get them to reimburse our expenses.

In the bottom line, Iberia customer service is absolutely horrendous. We will never fly this airline again. Hopefully, we are influencing many friends and anyone reading this review to do same.",May 2018,"August 15, 2018",1.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,4.0

Absolutely disgusting,London,Tenerife,Europe,"Iberia are an absolute disgrace of an airline who provide a service which is not fit for purpose. Firstly they sell connecting flights via Mardrid Airport with very short connection times. Whilst you may make the flight the luggage does not. Unfortunately there is no compensation offered for this if your bag arrives the next day, unless you keep receipts for everything and even then it only covers the cost of a toothbrush. In our case as well as not receiving our luggage, on our return journey we were sold a connecting flight which was not possible to make, despite myself my 6 year old and my pregnant wife running for the aircraft (we were sold a connection from the same terminal but in fact a terminal change was required). As we were put on a connecting flight two hours later, no compensation was due. A bag again did not arrive

We did complain to both Iberia and the CAA - both were useless and didn't want to know. You have been warned. Iberia get away with doing the bare minimum to comply with what is required in order to not have to pay compensation but moralistically it is wrong. The practice will continue of selling flights which are not fit for purpose as the connection is impossible to make. As mentioned the CAA do not want to know and Iberia will continue to get away with it. Do not book with them.... Id rather walk.",September 2017,"August 14, 2018",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Massive room for improvement.,London,Havana,International,"Having only flown the same journey a few weeks earlier via Virgin, I was interested to see how Iberia would shape up. I couldn’t fly via Virgin on this trip, as annoyingly they do not fly to Havana at weekends, so I had to pay about £100 more to fly via Madrid with Iberia.
The booking process (online) was OK, but the they going back to select seats and meals was a nightmare, in fact selecting meal preferences proved impossible and at the airport the check in staff would not allow us to select vegetarian meals. 
Iberia’s proud boast is that they are the most punctual airline on the world, but the6 are not. They are obsessed with getting off early, which is probably worse than being a bit late, as you are hassled and hurried, even if you are on time. 
The first let of the trip to Madrid was on the hottest, most cramped aircraft possible and would have put Ryanair to shame!
The connection in Madrid was fine and easy.
The aircraft Airbus A330-300 was really nice and the seats more comfortable than Virgin’s Boeing 777.
In flight entertainment, was not as comprehensive as virgin, but still good, with plenty of Morden and classic films, TV shows, music etc.
Food, this was shockingly bad, spam and cold pasta bad, even the brad rolls were cheap and nasty. You would only eat these offerings if you were really hungry.
Drinks - rationed and spilt!
The worst aspect of Iberia is there cabin crew, who are spectacularly rude; like grudging, scruffy, untrained, waiters who had been forced to work a double shift.

Irresponsible,Barcelona,Marseille,Europe,"Iberia sold be a flight ticket operated by another company (Vueling) not informing me about the change of departure time.

The story goes like this: Initially I booked a flight with Vueling and after a few days they informed me about the change of departure time ofering me the possibility to cancel the flight and receive a refund.
I checked available flights and I found the flight with Iberia that with an extra 10 euro gave me the same depature time Vuelling changed (nowhere was specified that the flight would be not operated by Iberia!)
So I cancelled with Vueling and receiving the money back I booked with Iberia.
On the departure day, arriving at the airport, I see on the display that the departure time changed. I go to an Iberia check-in desk and the lady tells me the departure time is the one I booked. She wasn't even aware that the time changed!!! I had to convince her that the display shows another time. After a call made to a colleague she declared that yes, the time changed. Like (I did not know this!) It was an almost 3h delay from the initial time booked.
So I send a complaint to Iberia. But the answer was they are not responsible because the flight was operated by Vueling. Really?
I am sure Vueling was very correct with me. The company I payed to is Iberia not Vueling. So I am expecting the responsability to be taked by Iberia.

Now, my question is: why a company would sell a service delivered by a third party, applaying an extra charge, not being aware of any change of the service and refusing any responsability!
The only thing I asked for in my complaint is to receive the 10 euro difference, not the whole amount of money. Because I received a service, right? But I did not receive the service I payed for. And Vueling deserves to be payed because it operated the flight. But Iberia doesn't deserve any money (the 10 euro difference) because it did not offer me any service - worst, it confused me with the wrong schedule, messing out my plans.

Terrible experience,Madrid,Hamburg,Europe,"I had a terrible experience with Iberia yesterday when I tried to travel from Madrid to Hamburg with a valid plane ticket that I had purchased and paid 2 months ago in combination with some Iberia miles. 

When I got to the airport 3 hour early, I was not allowed to check-in as I could not present the credit card I had paid the ticket with. My card expired last month and since I had already paid for the ticket and  got rid off the old card as recommended by any bank. In addition, I never had any issues with my credit card and travelled with this card across the globe never having any problems.

The man working at the ticket office at Iberia at Madrid airport was extremely rude and really did not give a damn about helping me:
•	I presented my email ticket showing proof of my purchase with my name on it. That was not enough.
•	I presented to him a photo proof of my credit card proving that the card was indeed mine which he did not accept.
•	I showed him the credit card bill with the Iberia charge showing that I HAD PAID FOR THE TICKET and there was not fraud.
•	He told me that I could not get on the plane and he would not even let me cancel my existing reservation and pay for the same seat on the same plane again. 
•	I was told that the Iberia flights during the next two days were fully booked up so that he could not even make me another reservation for me on another day.   I went online to see if that was true and there were seats available on both days. 
•	He told me that Iberia and Iberia Plus are two different companies! and that he could not help me since part of my ticket was paid with my miles. He said he had nothing to do with my ticket reservation and gave me the phone number of Iberia miles so that they could fix the problem. He would not even call on my behalf to Iberia Plus given that I am not a native Spanish speaker
•	At Iberia Plus on the phone I was repeatedly told that they could not verify my card. (even though they had proof that I had paid with this card on previous Iberia flights)
When I asked for reimbursement for my miles (I had paid a large part of this flight with my miles) I was told that the miles could not be reimbursed EVEN THOUGH I HAD NOT USED them and it was them who denied me access to the plane.
This is customer service at its worst.  I particularly would like to point to the extremely rude man working at the Iberia ticket office that did not have any intention of helping or reimbursing me. In addition, it is embarrassing that Iberia would not even reimburse my miles I had not used.

On top of that, the person that checked us in had no idea what she was doing and took 40 minutes.This is not her fault as she was new and had not received proper training. Please keep in mind this flight was operated by Iberia but done by Level. Our flight was supposed to leave at 3:55 and we got out of the check in area at 3:52 although having been there since noon. We then proceeded to wait on a hot, stinky bus to take us to our plane. We did not take off till about 6. Note that we were not aware of this as no notification was given to us.The captain did not speak once, except when referring to the crew. This again would not have been a problem but the fact that the flight attendants were rude and slow and the plane was dirty added to the situation. The Flight attendants would make rude remarks and could not speak english. Food for a 13 hour flight was an additional cost and mostly everything was sold out. Therefore, most starved for 13 hours on a cold, blanket-less(charged 12 extra euros), smelly, dirty, airplane. However this was just one experience.

So we arrived in Madrid too late for our connecting flight to Porto on Ryanair. We were told they cannot help us because that is the end of the journey on Iberia. To get to Porto, we had to pay a one-way tickets worth ~349 euros each. What!!!! My wife and I went from one terminal to another for over two hours trying to secure a flight on other airlines. Finally, we had to take an overnight bus (lasting over 8 hours) from Madrid to Porto. When we went to Iberia's Customer Service Center, they told us to file a claim for compensation. Today, I received a cold standard apology letter stating that due to external factors out of their control, they will not be reimbursing us for the bus tickets (102 euros).
I will not be taking Iberia Airlines in the future and let other know about it. Their customer service is very poor.",July 2018,"August 6, 2018",2.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0
DO NOT FLY IBERIA! Not worth any money you might get save.,Barcelona,Los Angeles,International,"I’ve flown all over the world. This was my first experience with Iberia and it was easily the worst flying experience of my life. 
The flight to Barcelona, unlike our return flight, was not completely terrible. Pros: we departed and arrived on time, our bags arrived intact, and the entertainment options onboard were great. The WiFi was mediocre, but that’s pretty common on most international flights. Cons: the flight attendants were hands down the rudest I have ever encountered, particularly a middle aged woman woman w short blonde hair. So nasty. Add to the rudeness the fact that this is the only airline I have ever encountered that does not even provide you with one glass of water on a 12 hour flight unless you request it AND pay $5 for it.  
The return flight was a complete disaster. The only Pro was that we arrived alive and didn’t have to deal with the demon flight attendant this time (though she was still on the plane and there were plenty of rude younger ones to make up for her lack of attention).
The Cons were innumerable. We arrived at the airport in Barcelona almost three hours before our departure time.  We were unable to complete our check in online due to a computer error. We had a bag to check anyway, so we figured we’d just do it at the airport. However, when we arrived, the check in line was already incredibly long and just got longer after our arrival. The line moved unbelievably slow. No one knew why. There were 5 attendants checking people in - all of them for our flight. They were each taking an average of 10 minutes to check in each party. After an hour of this and having hardly moved in the line, I went to front to find out WHAT was going on and if we were going to make the flight. Found out that the computer error was universal and that no one could check in online. But the fact that this was not communicated to any of us in line made for a very tense situation. I was later told by another passenger in line that an attendant had told her they would hold the flight until everyone had checked in and gotten on board. But they never changed the flight departure time, and as it got increasingly closer to departure time, we all grew more and more worried. Add to this that the airport had no air conditioning and that it was the first week of August, and you start to get the idea of what this was like. 
After over 2.5 hours in line, we finally got checked in. The attendant told us that she hoped we made the flight, but to run, because it was departing in 10 minutes. And we still needed to get through security. So we ran. No time to stop and buy food for the ensuing 13 hour flight with no free snacks or water. No time to stop and hit the restroom. Just run. At the gate? “We are trying to hold the flight for you. Please hurry.”  Once through, then wait in an shuttle bus with no AC and 40 sweating passengers to take you to another terminal to the plane. Rushed and pushed by employees and still left an hour late. Once on board, rude attendants unwilling to help with finding carryon space. A total nightmare. 
Then there’s the flight: no WiFi. Completely broken. Freezing cold airplane, even w two sweatshirts on, but you could buy a $15 blanket if you wanted!  Broken food ordering system. No one to collect trash. Literally. Then yelled at for leaving it on the floor. And to top it all off - they lost our luggage. Not just ours, but the last 30-40 people to board the plane.

I say I was unaware of this, but Iberia is certainly aware of this problem. The end result was spending eight hours in the Madrid airport instead of eight hours in Venice. Not much fun!

To be fair, if I were rating just the transAtlantic portion of the flight, it would be a 5. Good food, entertainment, wines, etc. But the plane change really put a damper on the trip",July 2018,"August 5, 2018",3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,,4.0,3.0,5.0
Bad experience with Iberia air denied  boarding,Seville,Amman,International,"I am now stuck in Seville airport where I have arrived early enough on time this morning to take my 1:10 pm flight to Madrid to connect to my other flight to amman Jordan and the Iberia airline denied my boarding. We r a family of 5 (2 parents and 3 children) and they first told me they have only 3 seats available and 2 will be solved on the boarding gate because I have a confirmed booking for this flight and the other flight to amman which are all under one ticket as well. And then at the boarding gate one of their staff came to me just a minute before closing the gate and said that we found u one other seat only for 4 can go and one has to stay in Seville, I told her again we r one family and one booking and we have a connection to amman from Madrid and I can’t send my wife with the kids alone so she tells me well then sorry we will off load your luggage and it’s not our responsibility !!! She was basically threatening me to induce me to send the family alone. I told her this is not right we have confirmed booking and u told me that Iberia overbooked the flight. She confirmed again that yes Iberia did over book the flight and that this is their right and they r not responsible for me if I decided not to send my family alone and that she doesn’t even know when I can leave and follow them. Accordingly I told her I know my rights and anyhow I just can’t send kids alone on such a long trip with connection as well in a big airport which they don’t know. So eventually they off loaded my luggage and I am sitting now for like 3 hours in front of the check in counter as they asked me to do and I really don’t know what will happen, another more professional guy from Iberia air came to us at the gate who asked us to go collect our luggage from the lost and found and wait for him here to see what he can do.

 I can’t really comprehend how can an airliner do something like this and not even have the courtesy till now to say we r sorry and try to ease things for us. We have just finished our vacation here in Spain and Seville was our last station and the kids are so frustrated now and the worst is I really don’t know what will happen now !!!!

Good luck if your luggage is lost,Ibiza,Alicante,Domestic,"The flight gate was changed at the last minute however all went well and flight on time.  Business Class on this 30 minute flight was OTT - we got offered ice cream, nuts, drinks but there really wasn't any time to enjoy them.  Very nice crew and great flight - and that is were all good things came to an end.
Our journey began with our flight from Barbados to London Gatwick on BA connection to Ibiza on BA and then the last leg on Iberia.  2 bags and a golf bag tagged all the way.  Golf bag made it but our 2 bags didn't.  It did not bode well to see at least 10 people at the IB lost luggage kiosk at ALC in front of us.  We filled out the report, we were given a copy of the report and the tracking details.  This was 02 August after travelling for 24 hours with layovers.  03 August checked online to see one bag was being sent to land in ALC at 9.30 a.m. and the second bag being sent on a late evening flight.  Tried to call the lost luggage number we were given all day 03 August to see if we could go and collect the first bag - no answer on each occasion.  Tried various numbers that we found online, emailed BA (as our flight was originally BA and booked via AA air miles) - no answer all day on any number and up to now no response from BA email sent.  Finally got through at one of the numbers and the agent could not verify that the first bag had in fact arrived at ALC.  The morning of 04 August checked again online and second bag had arrived and the status was updated that the bags were located and were being prepared for delivery.  Again about 20 attempts throughout the day to contact the airline to see if we could go and collect the bags with no luck.  Husband tried contacted Iberia via FaceBook and did get an initial response but then nothing.  Around 5 p.m. we finally got through to be told that the bags were being delivered but not until 10 or 11 p.m.  I asked the agent why the bags were being delivered so late and why no-one had bothered to contact us to update us - she told me that all bags going to Murcia (where we are staying) are delivered late in the evening.  I told her that we were not given that information at the airport and if someone had called us we would have driven the hour drive to go and collect.  She said there was nothing they could do as the bags had left the airport - she was indifferent and not very sympathetic to say the least.  Around 10.30 p.m. I called again and managed to get through and was now told the bags would not get to us until 1 or 2 a.m.  What a ridiculous time to be delivering bags to clients!   We are livid - we came to Murcia to play golf, meet up with friends who had flown over from the UK, to be stuck in a villa, unable to go anywhere because we have to wait for the delivery of our bags.  Not ONE phone call from the airport agent and to get through to them just about impossible.  While the last agent I spoke with - Libia - was very apologetic and sympathetic and while I lay no blame with her, the total lack of communication by the airport agents in the last two days and to have our bags in the delivery van all this time is unacceptable and the airport office closed at 11 p.m. so if the bags don't arrive as promised we have no one to answer our calls.  This is not the way to start a long awaited vacation - badly handled from the start.  Would I travel with Iberia again?

"Cancellations, dumping you off flights and refusing to honor One world alliance luggage allowances",Marrakech,London,International,"I was recently booked on Iberia codeshare BA for my travel through Southern Europe. Each leg of my travel was impacted and it makes it very difficult to keep to travel schedules because they either cancel flights or dump you off flights without notice. 
The flight out of Heathrow to Madrid on 18 June was cancelled and we discovered this when we went to check in.  We were rebooked 3 hrs later messing up our transfers etc. 
We were booked to return to Heathrow on 16 July from Marrakech via Madrid. At check in we were told we had been rebooked to return Madrid to London on 20 July.   Swissport staff at Marrakech airport refused to assist.   On 16 July BA website stated that this flight from Madrid to Heathrow was canceled and we were rebooked for London for 20 July to complete the 2nn leg.   This reschedule did not suit our plans as needed to be in London on 16 July and not 20 July.  

As we got no help in Marrakech we decided to go the first leg to Madrid from Marrakech and resolve our  onward flight.  The Marrakech Iberia staff refused to honor the BA luggage arrangement and we were obliged to pay for our luggage.  
On arrival in Madrid we were shocked to see the flight which we were originally booked on and which BA said was canceled was departing on schedule.  We discovered we were involuntarily re-routed without any advance notice. We managed to eventuality get onto a BA flight to London that night.  However,  this really caused unnecessary stress and angst and messed up the final leg of a 1 month journey through Southern Europe and Morocco.

Keep away from Iberia worst airline of 2018,Marseille,Ibiza,Europe,"On 3 August 2018 I went to Marseilles Airport for a 19:00 flight to Ibiza via Madrid. 
First we were delayed by 3h. 
Then we boarded a bus shuttle around 22:45. 
Then the bus stopped on the tarmac and a stewardess got on the bus: the flight was cancelled. 
We reverted to the terminal. Queued to go through customs again. Queued to retrieve luggage. And queued for 3h to be reassigned a flight. By then it was 2:30am and I accepted a Marseille-Munich (!) at 06:20, followed by 4h wait at Munich (where I’m typing this) and then a Munich-Ibiza. 
To spice things up after 2,5h of queuing to be reissued alternative flights, a lady stops in the queue at my level anne announces that all hotel rooms have gone. They can’t find taxis either to take us into town. So it’s up to us to find everything. I managed to get a hotel but I left a dozen foreigners stranded behind me who didn’t get so lucky. 
Allegedly the Iberia crew had reached their maximum flying hours by the time they landed in Marseilles at 22-ish and couldn’t take us.

"Poor Customer Service, Staffing and Multiple Misrepresentations",Madrid,Chicago,International,"Our family (two teenagers) flew out of Madrid this morning after a wonderful couple of weeks in Spain.  We have flown dozens of times as a family and I've flown many more times for business and today's experience was the worst any of us have ever experienced, as described below:
1.  Iberia's on-line check in only worked for three of us, with no explanation for why my teen-aged son couldn't be checked in online;
2.  We got to the airport 2.5 hours before the flight departed and spent 1:20 in line to get to the check-in desk.  This was due to the fact that Iberia had staffed only 4 people to check in all three of their departing international flights to the US that morning.  It is almost certain that several people missed flights due to Iberia's failure to adequately staff its check-in desks.
3.  When we got to the check-in we were told that my teen-aged son was on ""standby"" and did not have a seat because ""the flight is overbooked.""  This was difficult to believe, as we had booked 5 months earlier and it's impossible to believe that an airline would pick one minor from a family to deny boarding.  The gate agent evidenced an appalling lack of interest in this issue and just told us to ""go to the gate and maybe they can find a seat if someone doesn't show up.""  He also said ""this happens all the time, especially in the summer.""  Accordingly, it appears that Iberia grossly overbooks as a matter of practice.  This is obviously a completely unacceptable response, and he even refused to just let us buy and upgrade to business or first class to ensure a seat.  Again, it's difficult to put into words how completely disinterested and dismissive this guy was for what was a very difficult position his company had put us in.  
4.  When we got to the gate we were told that the gate agent had lied to us - our son wasn't without a seat, but had just been randomly selected for additional security.  This is fine, although Iberia shouldn't lie to a family and tell them that their son isn't going to have a seat on a flight simply because they want to pull him aside for extra screening at the gate.  He had a seat and the flight wasn't full - so either the gate agent completely lied about the flight being overbooked or he and his fellow under-staffed cohorts were so slow that dozens of people missed that flight. 
5.  Madrid airport sets new records for inefficiency and illogical security.  Our passports were checked FOUR TIMES - once at check-in, once at the security checkpoint, once at the train entrance to get to ""Gate S section"" and again at the gate.  Each checkpoint created a pinch-point and delays.  What on earth do they think the benefit would be of the second, third and fourth passport checks????  If you get in and have your passport checked you're not going to somehow present any greater risk if your passport isn't checked repeatedly again to confirm you're exactly who you were when you were checked the last time.
6,  While it was nice to be home, the Chicago Customs & Immigration desk was severely under-staffed, to the point where the staff were complaining to customers about how long the lines were and one staff member showed me a list of all incoming international flights (around 80, it appeared) and wondered aloud how they could only have about 1/2 of the passport kiosks staffed.  We agreed - there was absolutely no reason for the Customs & Immigration staffing to be so poor.  The net result was that it took 2 hours from touchdown to get to the offsite parking bus.

This requires a terminal change with a minimum time necessary of about thirty minutes.  The route is well marked, but perhaps a tiny bit confusing because you must go to/follow a green capital S.  My first reaction was that this is the route to the S-trains, a symbol used throughout Germany and Austria.  This change needs to be considered when making reservations.  It worked out for me, as every flight was on-time and the exiting EU passport control was not backed up.  Iberia's web site does not provide a seat map for your flight.  They refer you to seatguru.com which works very well.  Look there to make your seat reservation and you will get excellent info about the seating: leg room, seat reclining?, vicinity to toilets, exits, galleys, etc.   The only negative about my Iberia flights was that in Europe they do not use jet bridges.

Unfortunately, no such luck this time round - I do not understand how airlines can be so inconsistent with their training and leave the fate of their reputation to random crews. Some are good, some seem not to care. World class airlines like Cathay, Singapore, Emirates, they train their crews to have a consistent set of service and they seem to realize that beyond the hardware, the crews make or break their brands.

Anyway, on this flight, the crew was below par. Over the course of the flight, I was wondering why I kept seeing passengers walking up to the galley for stuff, until I tried to get something - the call button was triggered for 20 mins before I gave up and did what the rest did to get my water. Apparently the attendant was reading newspaper in the galley. Some 30 mins later, the attendant came to me and asked if I wanted anything since the light was still on (for 50 mins!). I guess the consolation was that she finally ""saw the light"". 

Lunch was hamburger rice, which is code for (unidentified) meat on rice with tomato sauce.

"If You Don’t Mind Traveling Without  Luggage, They’re Semi-Adequate",New York City,Zagreb,International,"Flying to Croatia from JFK our luggage didn’t make it to Zagreb.

Our flight back was the same thing. Got back to JFK—no luggage. They tell us we’ll have it within a week. Really???

I’ve had luggage delivered to me up the side of a volcano in Costa Rica within a day of my arrival. How can Iberia not get a bag to me from an airport with several flights a day in less than 4 days?

And the flights weren’t great either. They ran out of one of the entrees halfway down the aisle, the attendants were barely present and not informative. Just lackluster to apathetic service all around.

I really regret that, as from booking last year I have had nothing but problems. My flight was changed several times, once my connection from Malaga got into Madrid after the Madrid flight had left, each change has involved me having to ring them on a premium rate phone number. They NEVER answer emails, I am still waiting for any kind of response to one I sent them over a month ago complaining about the fact I purchased seats which they then arbitrarily withdrew and assigned different ones. When I complained over the phone I was told I could have my refund but they then couldn't guarantee we would have two seats together. As I had booked wheelchair assistance for my husband and he has visual problems, this was not much help really. I have to say in fairness the actual staff on the plane were very pleasant and helpful, but their administration side is dreadful. I also received an email the day before leaving telling me that passport control at Madrid was experiencing long delays, so I should get there earlier. As I was travelling with Iberia to Madrid, that was not much help.

"Horrible service, screwed up our flights, lost our bag",New York City,Florence,International,"To summarize this review before I begin:
- Didn't get the seats paid extra for, still waiting on reimbursement
- Inefficient primary hub (Madrid) causes issues with connecting flights
- Lost bag, 2 weeks to return it, no communication or updates during
- Rude customer service, flight staff, and airport staff
 
I wish I could give this airline 0/5 stars. It all started when I paid for 2 seats near the front knowing full well our layover in Madrid was short. They placed us at the back of the plane, and we nearly missed our flight. Then, we had that layover in Madrid, which took almost an hour and a half to get through customs because there were only 6/14 booths open. Then, on the way home, they lost our bag. I was told that the bag would be in New York within 3 days...2 weeks later our bag showed up, and they had no record of where it was, so we thought it was just lost and they were hanging us out to dry. I filed complaints for both clothes bought while the bag was gone and reimbursement for the seats. They have yet to reimburse either of those, even though its been 22 days since submitting the complaint. Again, there is no record online of what is taking so long. Lastly, customer service, flight attendants, and information kiosk workers were all objectively rude throughout the process.

A Nightmare,Johannesburg,Athens,International,"I booked our long-anticipated family holiday to Greece with Iberia instead of one of the Middle Eastern airlines even though they were a bit more expensive as I thought it would be a better experience.
How wrong was I?!
4 days before we were due to depart, I found out quite by accident that our flight had been cancelled. No direct contact, no phone call, no nothing.
After 3 horrible interactions with the Iberia call centre, during which time I was shoved around with no sympathy or real sense of interest, we were re-booked to depart a day later and return a day later.
As a result of this, we lost the value of our first night's accommodation and had to spend money on an additional night's accommodation.
All I asked from Iberia was a letter from them confirming that THEY cancelled the flight, to enable me to claim the first night's accommodation from my own travel insurance. I did not ask Iberia to pay for it. They refused. No explanation. So I lost that money.
Then came the eventual travel.
On-line check-in didn't work ; it refuses to take the passport expiry dates, when though they were entered 100% correct.
Check-in at the airport in both Johannesburg and Athens was the slowest I have ever experienced, having traveled extensively all over the world.

They promised to locate our luggage and have it delivered to our next stop (Avila is 1.5 hrs from airport) the next day. It never came. We called and told them that were were going to our next destination (Salamanca - now 2.5 hrs away from airport). We spoke to two different ppl, one in Spanish and one in English who assured us that luggage was coming to Salamanca. It did not. We spoke to another person in Spanish who didn't know where our luggage was and thought it was in Madrid. We we're transferred to English and spoke to someone who said the luggage was out to deliver in Avila. We told THIS person that we we're in Salamanca and he already had the address. He assured me he was communicating with the delivery company and redirecting them to Salamanca and we'd get the luggage that day or the next. We cancelled our next destination (non refundable) and stayed an extra night. The next day we called and spoke to someone in Spanish who said they didn't know where the baggage was that it appeared to be in Madrid. We we're transferred to English once again where we were told that it was attempted delivery in Avila but we we're not there. This is after we told them several times that we'd only be in a ila one day and were assured TWICE that the bags were coming to Salamanca. Then the guy read me the address and assured us it would be coming that day or the next day. After he implied that it was our fault for changing destinations, I asked to speak to the supervisor several times and was told that it was impossible and he was responsible for my call. We extended our stay in Salamanca for ANOTHER day, cancelling (non refundable) reservations in a second City because  we were told it would come the next day. Here we are day 4 and still no luggage. We called today and spoke with someone who says that the information they have is that we we're going to pick up the luggage in Madrid and there was never ANY OTHER INFO about delivery. They never sent our luggage out, it never went to Avila, and it was never going to come to Salamanca. The worst part of this is that there's no way to hold anyone accountable for not doing their job. There's no way to even register a complaint or speak to a Supervisor. Tomorrow we have no choice but to move on to another destination in Asturias which is 4 hours away from the airport.

Great as an Option to Avianca,Medellin,Madrid,International,"It's great to have the Iberia alternative to Avianca's non-stop to Madrid given the Avianca's excessive abysmal reviews and passenger complaints. in this particular case the roundtrip fare ended up even cheaper than Avianca's cheapest Business Class offering. I think Iberia is now more expensive, but may be worth it.

Business seat configuration on the Airbus A-330 hasve rows of alternatively curved seats (inboard/outboard) in a 1 / 2 / 1 arrangement of which I'm not a particular fan. The two center seats have a low fixed partition between them.

The arrangement affords considerable privacy with little interaction with other passengers, which some people will prize; flat reclining seats of no impressive width and generally cramped in my opinion.

In a nutshell: Food was average; Entertainment was excellent with a host of first-run movie/TV/documentary selections. Service (like Avianca) was highly impersonal. Crew couldn't wait to shove  dinner in front of you without the relaxing opportunity for a cocktail period, then practically ignore you for the rest of the nine-hour flight while they could fraternize in the galley until shoving breakfast in front of you in the morning.

Bottom line, given the negative reactions to Avianca's policies and service, I would not hesitate to stick with Iberia, hoping they get enough business to sustain the Medellin-Madrid non-stop.

"Great service, but look for specials and low season fares",San Juan,Madrid,International,"Flying from Puerto Rico to Europe does not leave you many options if you want to fly direct. Iberia is a very good option that flies direct to Madrid but also can get you there via NY or Miami. Roundtrip prices are usually around $1k or higher , but if you are date flexible you can find good deals around $700’s.
Service on board is good, with decent dinner (can’t say the same about breakfast though)and a wide array of video entertainment.

Bad luck,Canton of Geneva,Madrid,Europe,"Booked 2 months ago the fist flight of the day to Madrid. Check-in was done online as soon as it was available and had to book a hotel in Geneva the day before to be sure to arrive on time. Arrived at the airport 2hours prior, everything went smoothly, we were embarking. When it was my turn the ticket didn’t scan and an employee asked me to step aside. He asked me if I was traveling alone which was the case, then told me my seat was broken and I could only take this flight if someone else didn’t show up, which wasn’t the case.. I couldn’t afford to be late in Madrid but had no choice... they booked me on the next flight and I had to wait 5 more hours at the airport. The employees at the desk were laughing among themselves about the situation , I felt pretty bad. 
I did arrive in Spain 4.5 hours late, we’ll at least I did make it. They immediately gave me a compensation as well as a voucher to get food while waiting at the airport though.",July 2018,"July 18, 2018",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,,
On our way,Chicago,Dublin,International,My fiancé and now Wife and I booked a flight with Iberia for the first time to travel to Ireland. At the tine I haven’t heard of Iberia boy I sure do now. The crew was absolutely lovely people and patient with us passengers on a 7 hour flight. The crew where respectful and graceful as they attended to everyone’s needs especially the lil children on the flight. The pilots where giving us updates when needed.

"Mostly very good, ending horrible",San Francisco,Madrid,International,"The reason for the 1 is not the flight, which was perfectly fine.   Our challenge is that we not only missed our connection in Madrid, but we were told that it was our fault (basically we took our sweet old time when the reality was that we were in completely sweaty clothes when we arrived at the connection gate).

The flight was 35 minutes late...and we had 40 minutes to get out of the plane, walk to customs, sit in that line, head down to the shuttle train, get to the terminal, and run to the gate.   We arrived 10 minutes late...also another 7 people had the same issue.

Iberia officially flagged this as our fault and would not rebook us on other flights...we pushed and pushed and pushed and eventually got on a flight to another airport (this was the last flight to San Sebastián that day), had to rent a car, and drive to the hotel...instead of arriving at 5pm we pulled in at 1:30am.

They are the ones who moved the EAS flight 25 minutes earlier from when we booked, they told us we had ample time to make the connection, and they refused to help us when we missed this flight.  So poor on so many levels.

The flight was fine, so to me the take away is to have at least 2 hours if you are connecting through Madrid, especially in the summer.  I personally will not fly this airline again as long as I have a reasonable alternative.",June 2018,"July 18, 2018",1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,,,
Buying a ticket with an Airline but flying with another - American Airlines,Miami,Rome,International,"New trend is that you purchase tickets with an Airline but the flight is operated by another one.  I purchased my tickets with American Airlines to travel from Miami to Madrid  on May 11, 2018.  The flight was operated by IBERIA.  Be VERY VERY careful.  American will not assign the seat because it is up to Iberia.  Iberia will not do it because you purchase the ticket through American. My advise - get you seats assigned by strongly requesting them.  Otherwise you will be bouncing from one airline to another. You purchase your ticket and they are not cheap.  Tried to back extra legroom but it was not available due to the time I was able to stop the bouncing.
Iberia's airplane was very comfortable, good service and food was ok.  There was entertainment.
On the way back though - I flight with American.  Seats were better than Iberia since we were able to bough the extra legroom.  Be prepare to bring your own food. In a 12 hour flight + 30 minute s delayed they offered you 1 meal, 1 ice cream,  I snack type of tiny calzon and snack.  Best of it just ONE movie.  American need to remember people use to have three two meals a day - and offering just one movie during a 12 hr flight - daytime is really STINGY",May 2018,"July 18, 2018",3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,2.0
Unhelpful and awful service after their own mistake,Boston,Dubrovnik,International,"I recently flew with Iberia airlines, booked through Expedia. The total cost of the trip was around $1200US.

I had a flight from Boston to Croatia with a connecting flight in Madrid. In Madrid, Iberia had some issues with boarding - the airport itself told passengers to go to one gate and the airline emailed passengers to go to a different gate to board. About 30 of us went to the wrong gate and they decided to put us on a bus to the airplane. When they began taking boarding passes, they checked boarding passes but did not scan them through any machine. They put us on a bus and I got on the plane and went to Dubrovnik. 

After my week in Dubrovnik ended, I attempted to leave on my return flight. Iberia told me that my ticket was cancelled because I missed my flight from Madrid to Croatia. This is obviously not true - they put me on my connecting flight on July 1 and I was calling them from the Dubrovnik airport. They did not email me to tell me that my ticket had been canceled. They refused to let me back on, give me a new ticket for the flight, or to put me on a different flight. I spoke to 4 different people at Iberia who told me that my only option was to buy a new ticket and then ""complain on the website."" 

They left me stranded in Croatia overnight with no other options for return. I paid $175US for a hotel overnight in Dubrovnik, lost $80US on a hotel in Madrid I did not make it to, and I was forced to pay $1600US to get back to Boston with a different airline in order to make it home the day I was originally supposed to make it home.

A week after I got home, I called them again. Iberia told me that because I had booked through Expedia I had to make a complaint through them (this is the first time anyone told me that). I called Expedia and had them file a request for a refund. Iberia required me to send a copy of my boarding pass and from Madrid to Dubrovnik and so I did. They denied my request because I had been marked as a no-show DESPITE the fact that I was on the plane that they say I was not on. It is their mistake that there is no record of me being on the flight because their agents did not scan my boarding pass (they also didn't scan the boarding pass of the 30 other people at the gate - were their flights also cancelled?). They are now refusing to acknowledge their mistake and refund me my $1200US.

Eleven and a half hour delayed arrival.,Seville,London,Europe,"Our Iberia flight left Seville 30 minutes late.  We power walked to the connection flight (35 minutes) only to find it left without us. Clearly they could have warned us of this as they failed to put our luggage on board. We were put up overnight but the delay was hugely inconvenient as we missed pre-booked train links back to Swansea. Also I I had a lecture to deliver the following afternoon.

The Most Disrespectful Staff,Madrid,New York City,International,"My Trip with Iberia Airlines was absolutely awful. We had a layover from Zagreb to Madrid where the flight from Madrid would then go to New York. We had an hour to get boarding passes which they would not give us inside Greg and to get to the gate but near the end of the flight to Madrid the pilot told us that our takeoff was delayed leaving us with 15 minutes to get the boarding passes and to get to the gate. Not only was the entire thing extremely disorganized but numerous passengers also on the flight to New York also missed the flight because the pilot would not hold it. The only compensation we received was vouchers to a Hotel and we had to stay another day and take a flight the next day at 12. When we arrived the next morning we were able to get through security pretty easily with no major hold-ups. However20 minutes before the flight was supposed to board we then only find out that there is over a two-hour delay. Everybody is frantic and asking staff what is happening and why the flight was delayed. A majority of the staff cannot understand English or we're not interested in helping us and didn't care to offer information. My grandmother was in a wheelchair and thus had to be helped by a staff member. While everybody was frantically trying to find information we kept asking the woman helping my grandmother for any information, but she could not speak any English, which I do not blame her for considering I do not expect anyone to. However as the problem increased the staff although they could not understand us instead chose to laugh at us and make fun of us for not being able to speak Spanish. They did not care to help us and instead chose to ignore us or to brush our problem off. Even the man checking your boarding pass didn't bother to offer us any information and instead chose to treat us as if we did not know what we were talking about and instead laughed at us and did not care to help. I was not as bothered by the fact that they did not care to offer us any information but the fact that we noticed that they were making fun of us and gossiping about us instead of choosing to help. They were being extremely rude and even resorting to calling us expletives (when we were right next to them)  while they simply ignored our concerns because we did not want to miss another flight. We felt extremely disrespected for the unprompted behavior and it was quite upsetting because it only made the situation more stressful.The staff even told us there was another delay and refused to take us to the gate although we had an email proving that we were supposed to board. Although there many hesitations and complaints, they reluctantly took us to the gate. The whole process was extremely disorganized as there were no clerks at the boarding gate to offer any information while nobody could understand the intercom and there were groups of people crowding around the door leading to the plane. We (my family) technically had to fend for ourselves as the staff did not bother to help us as they were too busy talking in the corner. They were all just being extremely rude to us or no reason, even talking to other passengers about us. 

The fight wasn't much better as the cabin crew were also quite rude as they treated the passengers as if they were a burden or an annoyance as they had a very cold demeanor, did not want to help us, or rolled their eyes at other passengers. The whole trip was extremely exasperating and frustrating as this whole Airline and Airport was extremely disorganized and unhelpful. I genuinely thought I was never going to get home without encountering major issues such as even more delays or missed flights.

"Nice planes, nice staff, nice service.",Buenos Aires,Madrid,International,"I travelled to Madrid for a short holiday and enjoyed the flight from Buenos Aires to Madrid and also the flight back from Madrid.
Check in at the airports in both countries was organized and I was able to book my seat online in advance to make things even easier.
Flight schedules were respected and luggage was quick coming out onto the conveyor belt.
The crew was very polite and always smiling. They were also generous with respect to requests for food or drinks.
If you drink alcohol, I recommend the beer. (Mahou from a Madrid brewery)
Seats were ok, although I am almost 6 feet tall. I managed to sleep a bit, but economy is usually tough with respect to leg room and general confort.
The air conditioning was not a problem as is the case on some airlines and room temperature was ok. A light sweater over my tee shirt was all I needed.

Horrendous customer service,London,Jerez De La Frontera,Europe,"My son flew from Heathrow to Jerez via Madrid on Thursday 12th July . This was for a friends wedding on Saturday.

It eventually turned up 48 hours later on Saturday evening. He missed the wedding as everything he needed was in his case. Not one member of staff he spoke to was interested or apologetic for ruining his weekend.

Fraudulent and unfriendly!,Madrid,Reykjavik,Europe,"After an otherwise wonderful holiday we arrived at Madrid airport. Their check in computers jumped to Spanish completely randomly, causing you to start all over again, until it completely crashed. There was no help to get from the Iberia staff on location and the solution was to check in manually. While waiting in line, the barriers were changed two times causing 50+ people to rearrange everything, with expected results. Almost at the end of the cue, a staff member pulls us and two other couples out of the cue, says something in Spanish and walks away. I catch up with him for explications, and he tries to explain that he has other check in desks around the corner.
We get there only to face the most unfriendly check in agent I have ever seen, who tell us that we have no checked luggage for the flight. When presented with the receipt for both flight and luggage, she claims that the receipt is invalid since it's from a third party, (Flight Network), and proceeds to charge us €70 extra. The other options would be to leave it behind, or not go on the flight we already paid for.
If a company chooses to sell their services through a 3rd party, it is theirs to honor what is bought through that 3rd party, and entirely up to them to resolve issues between themselves. The fact that I have to resolve this as a customer is not only unprofessional, it is Fraud! An offence that in most countries is a felony offence!
At this point the atmosphere was not good to say the least. But a tiny plus was that she managed to assign to us seats on 3rd row. When we entered the plain we saw that this was right behind the business class divider, which is comfortably forward in the plane. The seats were a different color than the rest of the economy class seats, but otherwise the same shape and size so I thought nothing of it, until a stewardess came and asked us to relocate as she needed those seats for someone else (a lie!).
I tried to explain that we had been assigned those seats for the discomfort of the check in errors. She immediately got very unfriendly and rudely said that we were being moved, because we had not purchased business class seats, and it was clear that we had no choice in the matter if we wanted to fly at all!
She then moved the divider back one row. Throughout the flight the entire 3rd row, seats A-F, remained empty!
After relocating, the flight crew continued to be unfriendly. And we found out that there is more than a color difference between the seats, and the cushions of economy class are unnaturally uncomfortable. We suspect that is more due to their higher usage, than them being uncomfortable on purpose.

A little scary,Madrid,Charlotte,International,Everything that had to do with the plane moving was a bit unnerving. Taxiing was about as scary as anything. Who knew I'd have to hold on TIGHT to my armrests and plant my feet wide to handle the g loads from simply taxiing around the airport runways??? Once we were in the air things got a little better except the occasional dip and twist that had nothing to do with turbulence. Then came the landing..... One can tell which direction the plane is facing and our plane was NOT facing straight  on approach. It was far left then far right then far left again till our back wheels hit and we snapped straight.

The touch screen controls were slow or non-responsive, so I gave up.  The food was good: 3-course dinner and a light Continental breakfast. The wines served with dinner: Rolland Galarreta Ribera (2015), Baigorri Rioja Crianza (2015), Artero Mancha Reserva (2013), Val de Vid Rueda (2017) were excellent.

The problem was that it would take two days to get back to La Palma so we ended up buying two one way flights. To go we flew Iberia La Palma - Madrid - Mallorca but the connection in Madrid on the return was not possible so we had to stay overnight. We were not willing to stay overnight so to get back we booked a flight Mallorca - Madrid - Tenerife North with Iberia and then booked a local flight to La Palma with Binter (our local airline) so we got home the same day.

Mind you, we bought the tickets in January for a flight July 1st.

They have refused to call me even ONCE with an update, and no, I cannot speak to anyone else at the airline other than the customer call center.  Sorry to me.

Just OK Premium Economy,Chicago,Madrid,International,"We flew ORD-MAD-ORD with Premium Economy class. It was meh. Not being able to afford Business Class and being too tall to seat in regular coach, we have flown to Europe in premium economy in four separate occasions, with four different airlines: British Airways, Air France, Lufthansa, and now Iberia. Both British and Iberia are miles behind Air France and Lufthansa. This review is only for our recent experience with Iberia.

Check-in was terrible. There is a clearly marked counter at O'Hare for Premium Economy... but it is not manned, so they instructed us to stand in line with all the other passengers flying regular coach. In Madrid there are no Premium Economy counters, just Business and Tourist. This contradicts their advertisement: ""With the new Premium Economy service, you will have a separate fast lane access to Tourist class check-in counters."" False claim! 

Boarding and disembarkation were very good! First it's families with little ones, people who might need help boarding, Business Class and other hotshots. Then us, in Group A. We were also the first ones out of the plane, which was super nice.

Seats: Leg room is great! Seats are comfortable and also have plenty of legroom and a good footrest. However, our seats were not terribly clean, and my tray in particular was downright dirty.

Meal service: Nothing special, it is identical to the meal service in regular coach. In Lufthansa and AirFrance, Premium Economy has its own menu and better beverages than regular economy, not so in Iberia. Also, for a nine hour flight, they only offer you water or juice before taking off, one beverage with dinner and another with breakfast, and one bottle of water when dimming the lights for the flight. And that's it. I requested a second wine, they totally ignored me. You have to go to the galley to get anything else or die of thirst. Breakfast is terrible, just a sandwich with junk food products (KitKat bar, yogurt, crackers).

They give you also a toiletry kit, which is very practical. It was a red stretchy cloth baggie with the usual: socks, toothbrush, toothpaste, mask, and earplugs; it also included a hairband, which I though was a nice touch.

Overall Assessment: It was an OK experience, very basic. You get better seats and faster boarding... and a toiletry kit. You do get to check in a second bag for free also, if you need it. Other than that, it's exactly the same as regular economy.

We bought our tickets with a promotional fare price and we were traveling specifically to Spain, without any other connections, so it was a worthwhile purchase after all. But, in the future, if we have to pay for regular Premium Economy fare or make any connections to other countries, we will simply fly with another airline that offers more perks for the same price, such as better check-in experience, better food/beverages, better Premium service.",May 2018,"July 2, 2018",2.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0

Boarding and Disembarkation: Good! First it's families with little ones, people who might need help boarding, Business Class, and hotshots. Then Group A. There might have been a Group B, don't remember well; then Groups 1, 2, and finally 3. We were also the first ones out of the plane, which was nice.

Seats: Leg room is great! However, the seats in front of us were broken and they reclined further than the rest, so we almost had the two passengers in front rest their heads on our laps. However, both gentlemen had enough manners and common sense to rectify this and voluntarily lifted their seats to allow us to travel comfortably. Also, the seats were not terribly clean, and my tray was downright dirty.

Food and Beverages: Nothing special, it is identical to the meal service in regular coach.

Toiletries Kit: Small and practical. Nondescript stretchy cloth baggie with the usual: socks, toothbrush, toothpaste, mask, and earplugs; it also included a hairband, which I though was a nice touch.

In-flight entertainment: It was just fine. Some good movies but nothing extraordinary. I did not try wifi, as I always try to disconnect while traveling.

Bathrooms: No assigned bathrooms for this class; you have to share with the rest of the economy section.

Attitude: Pragmatic crew members. Treated us nicely, but not friendly at all. They were nicer to Business Class passengers, of course, they were all smiles with them, but with us, we were just cattle.

Overall Assessment: BARE BONES. Basically, you get better seats and faster boarding... and a toiletry kit, but nothing else. You do get to check in a second bag for free also, if you need it. Other than that, it's exactly the same as regular economy.

What a surprise and comparison,Vienna,New York City,International,"This is actually two flights, Vienna-Madrid and then Madrid-New York. The first flight was at  7:30 AM. Don't arrive too early as there will be no one to serve you earlier than 2 hours before flight time. Check in was straight forward and there was a small lounge for business with Austrian style breakfast. We are used to getting to Vienna from London using British Airways. BA's business is cramped with very, very poor legroom especially if you are tall. The difference with the Iberian business seats just jumped out at us when we sat down. More than ample legroom and better comfort than BA. The service was excellent and the breakfast more European. Madrid was something to experience. The airport is huge. You arrive in the domestic terminal and have to transfer to the international terminal. The sign said 24 minutes to transit. What it didn't tell you was that it was walk, train and walk some more. Clearly sign posted though. I was worried that the connection was too tight but despite masses of people we made it well within time. If you have time the shopping choices excel. The flight showed two gates next to one another which made boarding easier. Onboard the A340-600 the seats were 1-2-1. The seats were an older design but extremely efficient. The video screen was large and always in front of you as it did not need to fold away. On the way out to London from New York on American we were warned not to put anything under the seat as it would be lost or damaged when the seat was conformed into the lie flat position. This meant no storage. Iberia's seat allowed you a small space to store a bag when the seat was in lie flat position and an additional space next to the seat. We found this useful. What really stunned us was the quality of the food. You could have nuts with a drink but there was also really tasty olives as a choice. The ""tapas"" of starters made it seem that the entree had arrived as well. Its hard to describe but the food was a real touch of Spain and what Spain is famous for. An excellent flight all the way with attentive cabin crew. There was just one ""yellow card"". Iberia lands at Terminal 7 at JFK. If you are connecting, you have to pick up your bags and re-check them after customs. Iberia didn't have anyone there to assist or otherwise advise fast enough. There was just a British Airways rep who was being bombarded by 30 people all trying to get their bags rechecked. And don't try to take your luggage on the AirTrain between terminals. If the trains are full you will be waiting. Overall, great experience with Iberia. We will try them again next month to see if it repeats.",July 2018,"July 1, 2018",4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0

"""Non-reclining"" seats. Shorter armrests.",Stockholm,Madrid,Europe,"Iberia already had possibly one of the narrowest seat configurations of commercial aviation (at least of the airlines that I have traveled on). Well, in what could be interpreted as a further step to make the trips of its customers as uncomfortable as possible, the Company is replacing the seating configuration in some of its aircrafts. Specifically, the A320 in which we flew, had new seats from row 7, narrower, with shorter armrests (so short that you cannot share it with the passenger next to you) and –surprisingly—the new seat cannot be reclined. Yes, you have read well. The new Iberia seats cannot be reclined. The highest discomfort is for passengers in row 7, given that the seats in rows 1-6 can be reclined (because it is the ""Business"" configuration), so they will have the traveler in front of them with the reclined chair in front of his face. An unpleasant experience on long flights (we suffer it for more than 4 hours). In the new configuration, the seats of ""Business"" correspond now to a model very similar to the previous tourist seats (ie. a passenger of Business now pays for the comfort of a previous “tourist” seat, with the only advantage of having the central seat free). Special comment for the ""emergency exit"" that, if I remember correctly, it enjoyed a somewhat larger space for legs precisely because it was an emergency exit. Well, with the new seats, such ""extra"" space has disappeared. I imagine that some authority has approved this configuration of the plane, but common sense tells me that, in case of urgent evacuation, this new arrangement of seats could pose an additional risk to passengers. Possibly, one more step towards the ""low-cost"" strategy of Iberia.",June 2018,"July 1, 2018",2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0

One of the worst experiences,Zagreb,London,Europe,"We had connecting flights through Madrid from Zagreb to Heathrow. The check in was ridiculously long, and after getting to check out the agent would only give us our first leg boarding passes claiming we would pick up our connecting in Madrid. Once in Madrid no one would give us our boarding pass until the flight landed. Only then were we told that they didn’t have us in the system and we were lucky that the flight had room for us. We asked if our bags would be flown straight through to London as they were tagged as such. The agent assured as they would be and even checked the system. We arrived in Heathrow to wait 2 1/2 hours for no bags. Customer service tells us they never even arrived. We are to fly home to Canada tomorrow with absolutely nothing but our passports and wallets. The worse part is not just the sheer lack of care and utter interest in its guests, we were the 6th and 7th people from the same connecting flights from Zagreb through to London that experienced the exact same. As someone who has traveled with both small independent companies all the way to large ones, this is by far one way to ruin an otherwise good trip.

Customer Service was not the best,Madrid,Chicago,International,I have a mixed review for this airline since my flight to Sevilla was amazing. The customer service at the airport was horrible. We had a question and were sent to one agent and then that agent sent us to another line and then the agents blamed each other for the miscommunication. We ended up being the last ones on the plane even though we arrived 3 hours ahead of time! We sat in back of Iberian employees and the whole trip it felt like they cared more to cater to them then to us. At one point I even asked for a cup of water and she told me I would have to wait but when the employee in front of me asked she brought him a big water bottle. It was a very frustrating experience.

Great flight to my dream destination,Boston,Madrid,International,"After 30 years, I was finally able to return to Madrid. I took a non-stop Iberia flight from Logan in Boston to Barajas in Madrid. It was an incredible value at $530 round trip, including a seat upgrade.
Check in and boarding went very smoothly, and my window seat (33L) was very comfortable. There is plenty of in-flight entertainment on your personal screen, as well as options to watch the flight progress, and to shop, if you choose.
The food was actually decent, and there was plenty of beverage service as well.
My return trip was just as good. I was seated in 45J, but the entire middle section across the aisle was empty, so after take-off, I moved over and pretty much had my own personal suite.

Hidden costs,Madrid,London,Europe,"I travel regularly from Madrid to London and normally at a set time and day so it is tied in with my work schedule. Although the Iberia flights are not the cheapest the timing of the flights are scheduled most conveniently for my need.Its best to book at least 2 weeks in advance to get the cheapest tickets and the price increases as you get closer to your flight day. However if you need to check in a bag or want to select your seat then there are extra costs on the economy ticket, drinks and snacks on the plane is also extra. I tend to buy a bottle of water and probably a small snack at the various vendor machines around Madrid airport before boarding, this is much cheaper than in the airport shops or on the plane. 

Ocaasionly when the flight is ful Iberia will invite you to check in your bag free of charge when you arrive at the airport.

Our IBERIA Experience,London,Barcelona,Europe,"Our family of 5 arrived at terminal 3 at around 5:00 AM to give us sufficient time for check in and security check. There was already a long line of travelers at the ""British Airways"" (BA) counter. The BA flight was leaving for Barcelona at the same time as our ticket. There was no one manning the Information Desk to address my query. I was concerned not seeing any IBERIA flight at the electronic monitor, not realizing that BA services IBERIA bookings too- which was clarified much later. The electronic ticket issued should have manifested that. Our electronic tickets required for the printing of the boarding passes at the check-in kiosks, but apparently none of the kiosks were working. The other passengers in the long queue could not also address my query if BA flight as seen on the monitor would also accommodate our IBERIA electronic tickets. We took our chance to line up for 45 minutes in that line heading for Barcelona. It was to our dismay to be told by the staff at the counter that the airline has overbooked by 10%, and we were told to approach a certain counter at 6:50 to find out if we would be accommodated or not. I was quite disappointed to be given that advice considering there was a still a long line after us. How come we were chosen to be excluded from the processing, and not those at the last end of the line? We were given breakfast coupons to be redeemed at cafes on the 2nd floor. Carrying our heavy and big pieces of luggage through the escalator, we reached the 2nd floor to be shooed away rudely by an airport staff, stating that we should be checked in first. I was explaining to him that we were not accommodated yet as flight was overbooked. He did not want us to use the coffee shop. I was on the verge of losing my temper for his rudeness. We did not have to be further aggravated by his demeanor. We went down to the designated counter where to follow up on our status. There were other 2-3 other equally upset families not accommodated too. When it was my turn to talk to the staff, I kindly implored from the staff that our family could not miss this flight, nor we would allow ourselves to be split up on separate flights. We prepared well for this trip and it was not going to be ruined by the airline's fault. I have hotel booking in Barcelona and confirmed tours (2) upon our arrival. The flight was leaving at 7:40 and it was already 7:00 then. For some twist of luck, we were chosen and given boarding passes, leaving the other 3 families behind. We had to literally run to have security processed, and head to the gate which was quite a distance. I was thankful and at the same time so stressed out. It was the beginning of our Western Europe tour and the experience was not really that pleasant. The staff during the flight were all nice.

Spirit Airlines competition for Worst Airline!,New York City,Venice,International,"I booked Premium Economy seats a year ago (July 2017) for our flight from JFK to Venice.  

The day before we were set to depart, I received texts and emails that our flight between Madrid-Venice was cancelled.  The customer service was worthless. Actually, they did a great job at making a stressful situation worse.  We arrived to our Venice hotel almost 12 hours later than scheduled.  Iberia offered no compensation, no apology and no sympathy.  Our family of 5 were left to scramble for a hotel and food.

Our flight between JFK and Madrid was not any better.  The check in attendant was not friendly and argumentative, even when I showed the paperwork indicating the luggage allowance.  Honestly, I have no idea why she was arguing with us.  We each had one check in luggage.

The premium economy seats were a joke - nothing compared to British Airways.  They gave us one alcoholic drink and when we asked for a 2nd drink, we got the stink eye.  The 2nd drink came about 30 minutes after dinner was served.  

Plane was definitely dated.  Bathrooms not the best.  Least comfortable Prem Econ seats we have sat on.  For all our seats, we had to manually push the seats to recline and then pull to bring them back to the upright position.

We have flown in Prem Econ and Business class on other airlines.  This is the first airline where the flight attendants were physically gathering to get the headsets back from the passengers before landing.  I have no idea who would take these headsets; one cannot use them outside of the plane.

The worst airline!!,Florence,Madrid,Europe,"Traveling from Florence after a heavenly week, thinking the business class would be awesome , boarded a crowded bus from an overcrowded lounge at the airport. The plane seats were narrow and there was no recline!! Got to Madrid in misery only to discover that my friend’s bag was missing. No representative in sight, 10 or 12 people with missing luggage ran around to find a desk . The reps spoke no English and we spoke no Spanish, one gentleman kindly translated that we should wait for 20 minutes. After an hour we approached the desk again. This time ,they allowed everyone to file a claim ,so after 2 hours of landing we were able to leave. Since then, no news!! No calls or messages or tracking has worked!! Have been calling desperately and there is only Spanish at the other end!!",June 2018,"June 24, 2018",1.0,,,,,,,,
Great flight from San Juan to Madrid,San Juan,Madrid,International,"Easy flight, great service. Even though this is a Spanish airline, they spoke  English and were extremely courteous.

"Expect to fly 9.5 hours in a middle seat separated from your other family members, regardless of reservations.",Madrid,Miami,International,"Just flew back from Madrid on Iberia Airlines and what an awful experience.  Reserved seats for 4 family members to sit together, including a window and aisle seat, when I booked the flight 9 months ago.  At the airport, they completely changed the seat assignments to include all middle seats and put my 14 year old daughter between two strangers 20 rows back.  WTF!  
The only reason I have not given Iberia Air a less than Terrible rating is that the flight crew tried really hard to manage a number of similar situations aboard the flight. If you fly Iberia, be ready for your reservations to not really be reservations, your seat assignments to not be seat assignments, your family to be flying 9.5 hours apart, and the basic functions of running an airline not to be observed.",June 2018,"June 23, 2018",1.0,,,,,,,,
Worst customer serice ever,Madrid,San Francisco,International,"Booked for coming home flight after 2 week Spain vacation. Thought I had reserved seats but evidently they changed planes and never notified me so the night before the flight I found out I did not have my seats reserved. Was told I would have to get to the airport early as online check in was not available. Went ahead and charged some seats online so I could be sure and seat next to my spouse. We are senior travelers. At check in the attendant told us that we did not have seats reserved again and I showed her the credit card charge from Iberia showing we had purchased seats. She refused to honor them and gave us seats 12 rows apart when there were plenty of options to seat us together. We argued our case and she would not budge. We left and went to Iberia's customer service to complain. Finally found someone who helped us and was able to get us two seats together. Meanwhile after all this we barely made it to the gate in time going through a myriad of security checks as somehow someone, most likely the desk attendant flagged us as security risk.

Terrible flying experience and dismal customer service,Amsterdam,London,Europe,"Travelled with Iberia from Amsterdam to London Luton. Boarding passes said to be present 40 mins before departure time for boarding, all passengers where sitting and waiting but airline staff showed up about 5 minutes before departure time and took forever to get organised for no apparent reason. Plane took about 20 mins to drive to the runway and pilot stopped the plane and announced that one of the brakes wasn’t working and the engine was too hot to take off so we had to remain stationary for est 10 mins. 
Plane eventually took off about 10 minutes before we were supposed to land in London. Flight was fast yet concerning, plane seemed to randomly accelerate and slow down abruptly and without purpose. Inside was shabby and warning signs on the wings had visibly faded to become indecipherable. 
Airline staff were unhelpful and did not provide Tavel cards needed to access the UK, when we requested them specifically they seemed confused about what we were asking for. 
There was no recognition from the staff or pilot whatsoever for the significant delay until the plane started defending and a pre-recorded message appologised for the delay (as if it happened all the time so they had it ready to go). 
Landing was bumpy and seemed much faster than normal and getting off the plane took much longer than usual.

Vigo-Madrid-Malaga Airpot+ Train,Vigo,Malaga,Domestic,"Iberia time is spot on all throughout.  Right on time.

Vigo Airport is small, but clean and has a small cafeteria that allows you to have breakfast or lunch.  Iberia has a few counters and the security checks is small, effective and fast.  
In Vito you will board a bus on the gate that will take you to the jet, which was an airbus A321.  Everything was right on time, even the takeoff was tied at 50 mins past the hour.

Of course, Madrid is a huge airport.  Mind that gates are displayed 30 minutes prior to boarding time, so be ready to head for T4S or stay at T4.  But within 12 mins, you should reach your gate if you have to change to T4S (satellite via train).

On Malaga, which is a big airport, take advantage of the train!  Really cheap and immediately available outside of the baggage claim.   Train departs every ten minutes all the way down to Fuengirola while stopping on many other stations for about 2.5 euros or so.

"They do not pay compensation as due, nor respect the ticket you bought",Lyon,San Jose,International,"In 2009, Iberia ignored the European regulations in a trip to Montevideo. Repeat in 2015, another trip to Montevideo in Business, cancelled flight and we even had to pay for the taxi to the hotel and did not give again a phone call. Returning, again cancelled trip after return to Buenos Aires. Denied any compensation because they said they were birds that caused the problem. This excuse is used time after time that even judges got fed up with it, and there are not birds that fly high in Uruguay, no Condors ! We wrote many letters to Iberia and were ignored.
Then this year we took the plane in bus. To go to SanJose, Costa Rica,  and the ticket was saying clearly that we could change the date, etc. We were stolen of our money, passportcredit cards, ATM , so we call them to change the date to return immediately. The answer was that we had to pay 1770 dollars each if we wanted to do it. We went to a travel office, and they confirm that Iberia always does that.  So, we did not need to beg, because some university friends offer to have us and feed us. 
Do not use Iberia, the personnel, pilots , stewards might be good and do a good job, but the manager is a crook, and we will continue writing to them and the EU until they pay us what is due.

We were told that we could not get on that flight as there were no business class seats, we asked if we could go economy (where there were seats) but were told that we could not change classes unless we paid full fare for new economy tickets.

I have never dealt with a more incompetent airline or staff in my life. We fly 20+ times a year and never have I written a negative review (not after food poisoning about a restaurant, salon, airline, etc) but everyone deserves to be warned prior to booking a flight with Iberian air, they cost us $3500 + and wouldn’t refund our return tickets.

Our suggested layover by Iberian air from Madrid to Barcelona was approximately 1 hour. This hour layover is the flight route they suggest online while booking, we booked a round trip back to Boston on 6/18. Due to the long customs line and security over 20% of the passengers missed their next flight, we RAN (not walked) through the airport. By the time we made it to the gate the airplane was closed, us and 25 + people missed the flight. My husband and I had reservations in Barcelona later that day with a pre paid group. We called Iberian air to request another flight, they couldn’t guarantee us to be on a flight until the next day, it is 8:00am at this time. The customer service rep we spoke to suggested we book a flight on Vueling, they’re partner airline. We did this for $300 without complaint, while not being refunded for the flight from Madrid to Barcelona. The flight to Madrid is an hour and a half.

Security check is a disaster, forwards and backwards in cordonned off rows with very few passengers, good exercise I suppose. And the same again at passport control! Someone making money from selling the equipment. Boarding on time ..... then 30-40 minutes waiting for what the pilot called ""missing paperwork"". The world's self proclaimed most punctual airline, I don't think so. 
New Airbus 330 aircraft but with too many seat rows, you get a very hot IFE screen right in your face, especially when the guy in front goes right back. Good selection of films though, at no extra cost.
I'm sure the staff would have been competent in an emergency, but they all look so glum. When you see them.

Unfriendly and lier staff,Madrid,Donostia,San Sebastian,"I am in the middle of a nightmare with Iberia and I see tens of other people in the same situation specially the non-Spanish speakers. I flew in from Boston. The flight was delayed however , there was a long line in front of Customs. I told the staff that I have a connecting flight, could you please help me. They said get back in line. As a result we missed the flight. First the agent wanted to charge us even though the delay was their doing. Then they waitlisted us on 3 flights. On one before last , I was told that we had high priority. But two Spanish speaking ladies spoke to the agent and he immediately sent them in. One of the ladies even pointed out that we had priority and he said no. I complained and he said he decides whom gets the seat. Every one of these wait lists took me one hour of waiting in their customer service. They lied and lied. Eventually at night time after the fourth try they gave me seat & on the way their they stopped us and said flight is cancelled. They could take us to a neighboring city. They were so unprofessional and never told anyone what was going on . Once it came to my turn, they said no room and gave me voucher to go to crappy hotel and take the flight the next day. I missed the first ceremony of my cousin’s wedding and God knows what will happen tomorrow . Extremely unprofessional and lying staff members. They would taunt everyone to write a complaint report and I would see them take it to the side and collectively laugh about it. I lost a whole day and I have to spend the night here too.

Most disorganized airline,Marrakech,Valletta,International,"Most disorganized airline I have had the misfortune of flying!! Our complaint with Iberia airlines began when we were stuck waiting to board at the rear doors of the aircraft on the steps in the hot Moroccan sun for 20 minutes, only to be told they needed to close the rear door so we would have to walk to the front. My mother, with her bad knee, and I walked back to the front doors of the aircraft where we were the last ones on board. At the top of the steps a man begins putting tags on our hand luggage without saying a word to us. I ask if this means they will have to be checked and he just says “NO SPACE NO SPACE” and gestures inside. I understand we are the last ones on the plane (not intentionally) so there is no space left but they could at least tell us what was happening with our bags instead of taking our luggage without a word. 
Inside the plane, there is no soap in the toilets which we realized after another passenger spilt Coca Cola on top of my mother wearing all white and even got on a brand new 200€ leather belt. Now the belt is ruined, shirt stained, and my mother is completely sticky. 
On arrival in Madrid, we wait to collect our bags next to the plane as the agent in Marrakech had instructed us. One of the flight attendants informed us that our bags were “probably” en route to the final destination of Malta. We replied that there was no information given, as to our final destination, so we deduced that the bags must be in Madrid. We are then told that “most likely” our bags were in Madrid but we would have to go outside security to collect them and then come back. After waiting at the baggage claim the bags finally arrived. We narrowly made our next flight and were one of the last on this flight as well.
On our next flight we were lied to by two agents saying there was absolutely no space for our bags but once we were inside we found at least 10 empty spaces (as well as numerous empty seats) that we could have used rather than leaving our bags to get lost again.
Overall a miserable experience flying with Iberia, I would recommend flying any of the low-cost airlines who have a better standard of service than this. I would have rather swam through the med than gone through this.

Awful end to a great European vacation,Marseille,Miami,International,"I had an AWFUL experience with Iberia Air yesterday. 1) They don’t allow you to check in online, but they do let you waste your vacation time making multiple, frustrating attempts. 
2) They have no sign up at their check-in counter in Marseilles where I was flying out of. I spent over an hour and walked back and forth between terminals and floors, asking directions, all over the airport trying to find the counter to check in. 
3) The flight connection in Madrid was delayed over two hours without any explanation at all. I did receive an email from Iberia around that time, but it was in GERMAN and I couldn’t understand what it said. Why was it in German? 
4) They finally let us in the gate, packed us into a bus like sardines and drove us out to the plane. They left us crammed into the bus, waiting like that for FIFTEEN minutes. 5) They finally let us out of the bus to walk up the steps up to the plane. The problem was that they opened BOTH doors. I had to walk fifty seats back, AGAINST traffic. It took me 20 hateful minutes of lifting my bag over dozens of seats to beg and apologize my way back to my seat. 
6) The plane was very dirty. There was a dirty, broken fork on my seat, garbage on the floor and in the seat pocket. The bathroom floor and toilet seat had urine all over them and there was no soap in the dispenser. Definitely makes you nervous that fly on a plane that hasn’t even been cleaned correctly.

"Non-Existent, Horrible Customer Service -- The Worst",Boston,Rome,International,"I had always heard bad things about Iberia, so I avoided them when booking my flights to Rome. I was originally supposed to fly out of Boston to Philly, then connect in Philly to fly to Rome. However, weather issues and delays in Boston would have caused me to miss my connecting flight, so they switched and put me on an Iberia flight to Madrid from Boston, then Madrid to Rome. Big mistake.

The flight itself was fine, there were no issues. It was cramped but that's usually the case with those types of flights when you're flying Economy, I have yet to fly in a plane that's roomy. The issues came when I got off the plane and tried to find my connecting flight to Rome, as there was some confusion about which gate my flight was departing from. Since it was 4:30 in the morning, there wasn't anyone around the airport to really help me. Any Iberia employee I tried to talk to was rude and dismissive, only lifting a finger to help when I persisted. As a result, I ended up going through security three different times because I was told three different times that my gate was in a different terminal.

Finally, I find the gate. The flight itself was fine, but when I headed over to the baggage claim, my suitcase wasn't there. I waited for 45 minutes. I finally went to the Lost & Found, which was totally unhelpful and useless. They blamed Iberia for losing my bag, so I filed a claim.

I try calling Iberia to file a claim and follow up with them, and nothing. Nothing. Their American assistance line does not offer English, because the people I tried to speak with didn't speak it. Also, sometimes no one would answer the phone, and when they did, they would put me on hold and then disconnect me. I couldn't get through to anyone. This went on for 5 days.

I ended up calling American Express and they followed up. In less than 10 hours my suitcase was delivered to me, no thanks to Iberia. Horrible, horrible airline, I will never fly them ever again. Don't make the same mistake I did!",May 2018,"June 12, 2018",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,3.0

A very bad experience,Buenos Aires,Vienna,International,"This was our flight home from a trip to Argentina, connecting through Madrid. 
In my opinion, the seats on the trans-Atlantic flight are really uncomfortable, with the passenger in front of you basically sitting in your lap. My back was also not amused by this posture. 
Shortly after boarding, I discovered some trash and wet dirt (mostly in the form of a half-eaten sandwich) in the seat pocket - really disgusting. The flight attendant took the half-eaten sandwich with disgust, but no additional cleaning was offered. 
However, the main issue was the time of the connection flight that was sold to us by Iberia. We had a gap of ~1 hour from landing in Madrid to our connecting flight, which sounds like it should be enough, and therefore we weren't worried when Iberia sold us this connection. However, when we landed in Madrid it turned out that the terminal where our plane landed is ~30 minutes away (by walking + airport train) from the terminal where our connection flight was. Since the line at the border control was also ~30 minutes, and boarding to the connecting flight closed 15 minutes before takeoff, we eventually missed our connection by a few minutes. Given their routine use of Madrid airport, I would expect Iberia to know that a 1 hour gap is not likely to be enough and to advise us accordingly. 
After missing our connection, we had to stand in line to get a replacement flight arranged. This was simply a nightmare - there were only 5 groups of people in front of us, but the service was EXTREMELY slow so we ended up waiting ~1.5 hours in this line until the replacement flight was finally arranged. Requests to bring more Iberia representatives to the service counter (for the most part there were only 2 Iberia representatives, and the line just kept getting longer behind us) were rudely ignored. One representative even had the audacity to leave her shift while the line was growing longer. By the time we finally reached a representative, my wife was already quite distraught (and rightfully so). However, instead of apologizing profusely, the representative behaved very rudely, accused us of being late for the connecting flight we had missed, and shouted at my wife until she began crying. This should have been avoided, and would have been avoided had our waiting time been shorter, and had the representative been better trained (or better screened before she was allowed to work with customers). 
In addition, Iberia representatives (both at the gate and at the service desk) assured us that our luggage has not been sent with the flight we had missed, and would be waiting for us at our final destination when we arrived with the new flight. However, this was not the case, and we had to go to the lost in found desk at the Vienna airport. There are 2 lost and found service desks in Vienna, each taking care of different airlines: one service desk had 3 representatives and no line, and the other had only 1 representative and and a ~30 minute line - guess which one serviced Iberia customers?... So we had to wait another 30 minutes (this is after ~25 hours in airports) for our luggage that had not arrived as promised. As expected, we found out that our luggage had already arrived with the connecting flight we had missed, but at this time there was no one who could locate and deliver it, so it was scheduled to be delivered to our home the next morning ~8 AM. However, by 12 PM no one had called us, so we called the lost and found and were told that they had called my cell at 8 AM and there was no answer (more lies, of course there was no record of such a call...). Finally, a few hours later, the luggage arrived.

After reading other reviews, I was like alright it couldn’t be THAT bad. But here I am, creating a TripAdvisor account to specifically write this review. Me and my group took a round trip flight from Boston to Barcelona. I’m utilizing the hour we’ve been sitting on the runway right now (after our 8 hour flight) to write this review. Apparently they didn’t coordinate who’s using the gate right now so we’re still waiting. 

First of all, they keep the plane at a healthy 55°. There are no personal air vents so you’re at the mercy of the $12 blankets they walk around selling. Out of the entire 8 hours, they never looked our way one single time unless we ordered food. (Which apparently you have to do when you book the flight months ago? So sorry, you’ll have to go hungry). By hour 5, I had to literally flag the flight attendant down to get a glass of water. She said if I didn’t want to buy the one in the bottle, I had to GET UP and go get it MYSELF in the back of the plane. 

I booked with Iberia Airlines, but now it’s owned by Levels, or they partnered with them... nobody even knows. But I did not sign up for this.

T4 in Madrid has become an absolute disaster,New York City,Granada,International,"Iberia's terrible crowd control continues it downward spiral. Add to this their expensive and inconsistently-applied seat selection policy and you have I outlandishly stressful travel experience. But the new, unexpected, hideous wrinkle now is the truly horrible mob scene at every point in the Madrid airport.  And since that is Iberia's own terminal, they certainly are culpable in the matter.  The line at passport control returning to the U.S. took almost 45 minutes to get through. The line at the unnecessary security check between connecting flights upon arriving in Madrid--unnecessary because no one has left the secure area since de-planing--stretched halfway across the terminal and took over half an hour to get through.

First Time Flying Business Class,Los Angeles,Madrid,International,"We ended up flying business class non-stop with Iberia for three reasons. (1) Didn't want to risk missing the last connecting flight out of Miami to Madrid; this non-stop only had a choice of Economy or Business Class (we need to fly at least premium economy since our bodies just don't fit into those regular economy seats anymore). (2) Didn't want to fly through LHR on our way to Madrid (thus Iberia connecting through Miami rather than British Airways connecting through London). (3) Wanted to see if we could actually sleep on a plane if we were in lay flat seats (while premium economy is roomy enough, we never can get much sleep). 

The best things about flying Business Class were having your own line at the check-in desk, having access to the airport lounge, boarding the plane before economy fliers, and having plenty of room in the overhead bin. The preflight hot towel and welcome orange juice were nice treats also.  Our seats had plenty of room and were very comfortable.  I think I could have slept very well, if it hadn't been for all the turbulence we encountered. It always seemed to happen just when I was starting to drift off to sleep ... *sigh*  Anyway, the food was great - much better than I had expected it to be - and it was all very filling.  I did not have to dig into any of the snacks I had brought on board just in case I didn't care for the provided meals, or if these meals were insufficient for my appetite. 

About the only bad thing was boarding started about 30 minutes late, which made the flight about 20 minutes late taking off. I seem to recall we made up some time, so landed close to our originally scheduled time (?). Since we landed at the Satellite Terminal, it took quite awhile to make it over to baggage claim.  I think our bags were already on the luggage carousel by time we arrived at baggage claim.

While I was a bit wary of flying Iberia based upon others' reviews, I did not have any issues with the flight or level of service.  Although it did cross my mind to wonder where all the flight attendants disappeared to when I happened to be up from my seat to use the facilities (they certainly weren't hanging out in the galley) ...

Terrible booking system and rude telephone support,London,Madrid,Europe,"It took me over 40 minutes to book the flight online - a booking that should have been simple, but the system kept adding my surname to my partners booking and vice versa. Whilst doing this, the flight price increased by £60.   The system wouldn't allow me to add baggage and then I received an email saying my booking wasn't confirmed it was in progress. It had booked the wrong names. I then called your 'customer service' department and the rude person said I had booked the wrong names (I do know my own name!) and it would take 24 hours to change it back. Then I could add the luggage tomorrow.

Only one small complaint: we were seated one row behind the two seats by the exit door which were both empty.  When we asked if we could move, the flight attendance said we needed to keep our assigned seats.  However, the man sitting across the aisle, apparently a native Spaniard, appeared to ask the same question in Spanish and was allowed to occupy the bulkhead seat for the majority of the flight.

THE WORST,Houston,Madrid,International,"This is the ABSOLUTE WORST AIRLINE EVER. I have been emailing them bi-monthly since returning in January and yet to be reimbursed for what is owed to me from my delayed luggage. When arriving in Spain they had lost my luggage. The employees either had no knowledge of procedure or did not care, either way they were some of the worst customer service agents I have ever encountered. They did not offer my an overnight kit as their website states they will, they did not have any idea when my luggage would arrive, nor did they know how I would get new things or if it would be covered by the company. Since returning I am well aware of the LAWS that they are required to uphold, but do NOT. I have all the documents with my receipts of cost incurred due to their misplacing my luggage. I have received nothing. They seem to know they are awful and have issue often as it is nearly impossible to speak to anyone in customer service that takes ownership in the company.

Be aware of the unfair hand luggage policy of IBERIA,Madrid,Brussels,Europe,"In accordance with the information on the IBERIA website, you can take with you one carry-on bag (56 cm x 45 cm x 25 cm) and one personal item (a handbag or small briefcase, a laptop computer or camera, a baby bag with food, drink and materials for the flight).
So you measure you suitcase, see that it is small enough and think that you are on the safe side. But this is not the case.
They announce that the flight is busy (it was busy at all 3 times we used Iberia) and then the fun starts. 
When it is time for economy class passengers to board, at first frequent flyers of Iberia (not surprisingly all Spaniards) can go with their 2 (or sometimes accidentally even 3) pieces of luggage... Next are the people sitting at the back of the plane (Grupo 1, the groups are printed on boarding cards), then the ones at the middle part (Grupo 2)… And finally you, if you are unfortunate enough to sit in the first 10 rows of the plane (belonging to Grupo 3, among 3 last persons, apparently all others from this group were Iberian frequent flyers). 
Of course by this time no chance to take you 1 piece of hand luggage with you - the plane is full of other people's 2-3 pieces of luggage.

"Fine, unless you want to travel with golf clubs!",Madrid,Edinburgh,Europe,"I have travelled across Europe and to the USA with golf clubs and this is, without doubt, the work experience ever.  I couldn't book the clubs online (and as it was within Europe I couldn't take the clubs as one of my pieces of hold luggage) so I called Iberia and was told to call back the next day after someone looked at the plane to see if we could take them - thought this was quite quaint at this point.  I called the next day to be told we could take the clubs but we couldn't pay over the phone, we would just pay for them when we checked in.  Oh no, we waited in the very long queue (as I wasn't able to check in online, first time that has happened as well) and was told we would need to go to another desk to pay for the clubs, and then bring them back.  The other desk was grossly undermanned so we waited there over 20 minutes. Then we had to go back to the desk and after the bag was eventually tagged then check in desk attendant closed her desk and walked with us to the outsize baggage, which she needed to activate.  But she couldn't so she needed someone else to do that to start the machine up again.  Luckily we gave ourselves plenty of time to check in as we were around 1 hour and 15 minutes to get checked in and the bags through.  I have never known anything like it, and it will stop me from travelling with them again.  The inflight magazine was all excited about some new plane they have ordered, but if their booking system won't allow booking of golf clubs (on a Spanish airline, Spain is world famous for it's golf) then I think they need to be looking at fixing that before buying new planes.

The worst experience ever.,London,Vigo,Europe,"Wanted to take our dog abroad, so phoned Iberia to confirm this was okay. I gave them all the details of the trip and they advised it was fine, but that I needed to book our tickets first then call them back with the booking reference number. 

Booked our tickets on-line the following day and called them back, only to be told they couldn't fly our dog out – apparently the person I spoke with originally had misinformed me. I told them to cancel our tickets, as they would be of no use if we couldn't fly with our pet. I was then told it would take 3 weeks for a refund to go through! So, they can take your money straight away, but take weeks to give it back!

Phoned them after 3 weeks, as the refund still hadn't come through, only to be told that it'd be another week! The person I spoke with was basically trying to blame the bank – she'll email the cancellation confirmation to me, but I'm supposed to print this out, take it to me bank and ask them to refund my money! Not happy with being told different things by different people I asked to speak with 'someone in charge' to which the response was there isn't anyone here. Before I could say anything else, they put the phone down on me.

I've now received an email confirming the refund (although the actual refund itself hasn't gone through) only to find they've charged me a £354 cancellation fee!!

In my case, I traveled from Barcelona to São Paulo.
They left my luggage in Spain, and it wasn’t delivered for literally days.

I asked them to compensate for just how much I had to spend for the basic clothes and shoes that I needed to just go out, but they never contacted me.
After having had to call them so many times, they reluctantly provided an email address to send receipts to.
I did what they told me.
They didn’t contact me for weeks.
I contacted them again in a rather harsh tone because it went beyond my tolerance.
Then I didn’t hear from them for months.
I called them again finally, but their response was once again they will take a closer look at the cause of the delayed payment and will get back to me when they find out something.
And it has been days since then. I have asked them to set a timeline but they never responds to this request.

Madrid to Palma,Madrid,Palma de Mallorca,Domestic,"I do not like being critical of airlines, they have a difficult business and clients/ passengers are much more likely to criticize than praise. Great service/ low price is considered to be normal. Thus for me the service has to be poor before I get anxious and irritated. It has to be terrible before I complain. And so it was a when we flew from Madrid to Palma Mallorca on Iberia. We were full, there was no room between my knees and the back of the seat ahead. I am not tall  (5'9"") almost the definition of a normal height for an old NA male. The stewardess made sure no one was reclining their seat, an obvious admission that the space between seats is too short to accommodate a normal person. In other words they know damn well that it isn't comfortable. IE 1 hour 30 minute flight you pack them in as tight as they can before they squeak. Thus the airbus we flew on was configured in such a way that the air line has to know and consciously decides that customer comfort is totally irrelevant to maximal airline remuneration. I am thin, average hight and have no orthopaedic abnormality, but I could not find a comfortable position in my seat between having my tail bone on the rail rod for the back, or my knees jammed against the back of the seat ahead of me. The Airline knows this, but they figure you will suffer the pain for a cheap flight.

After booking, the layover time was decreased (I wouldn't have booked it with such a short layover for this reason) and we almost missed our connecting flight. No one came to help us or give us info, we literally had to run across to another terminal hoping we would somehow make it. When we reached the other terminal, even though they were in fact holding the flight, no one understood this and we were given an attitude and almost not let through to board the flight.
- Stewardess was also rude and put words into my mouth when I simply asked to make sure she was giving me the form for US Citizens.

THE WORST AIRLINE AROUND!,Milan,Johannesburg,International,"Dear Sir/Madam

A quick description of our recent ordeal with IBERIA. It may help other travellers avoid enduring a similarly  unpleasant experience.

IBERIA is a disgraceful and poor excuse for an airline.

My partner and I recently travelled to Europe and booked our flights with IBERIA. It turned out to be the worst possible choice.

Upon starting our return trip to SA, my partner ended up  being stuck in Milan Malpensa for over 36 hours and, thanks to the shoddy and unprofessional IBERIA’s “service”,  for another 24 hours thereafter, when they refused to re-route him to Madrid on a different airline!

IBERIA cancelled his flight from Milan to Madrid (while waiting for his boarding time at the airport) and caused him to miss his IBERIA connecting flight to Johannesburg.

Worse, yet, IBERIA never made any announcements to alert passengers of the cancellation. My partner was therefore forced to check into a hotel for the night AT HIS OWN EXPENSE just like for his dinner and transport. And, at this point, still no contact being made by IBERIA.

IBERIA have no staff, representatives or handling office on the ground at Milan Malpensa. Passengers were left stranded and without any assistance whatsoever.
I, too, en-route to Joburg  from Vienna (via Madrid), personally tried to get ground staff to assist  once I got to Madrid but to no avail. 
In decades of extensive international travels I have never encountered such dismissive, unhelpful and downright rude behaviour as I have while dealing with IBERIA ground staff.

Due to IBERIA’s lack of interest, professional ethics and shoddy organizational skills, my partner was eventually forced to spend a SECOND NIGHT in Milan instead of being booked on the first flight home on a different airline. No apologies or show of any kind of interest in the welfare of their passengers.

It’s also worth mentioning that IBERIA can only be contacted (both locally and internationally) via one phone number………but wait……….only from a landline…………to hell all those travellers who are on the go and only have mobile phones on them!
For those lucky few who manage to get themselves to a landline and, after much ado, through to an IBERIA operator………they get to enjoy a morose and unhelpful interaction with an ill-trained and uninformed consultant who, 9 times out of 10, will hang up on you when the questions you pose become too….complex?

Their website is also an exemplary case of utter inefficiency! It stonewalls anyone’s attempt at pre-booking seats on line…….it lets you go through the entire, tedious procedure and then it refuses to process the request! We personally tried FIVE times. A ploy to get passengers requesting a window seat to pay extra at the check-in counter. Absolutely disgusting!

Once I finally touched down in Joburg, I immediately contacted Swissport (the handling agent for IBERIA at O.T. airport).

Swissport staff were absolutely helpful and APPALLED at the ordeal we were being subjected to. The Manager of Operations, Sandra Guedes, and two other ladies, kindly and repeatedly contacted IBERIA requesting that our situation be resolved as a matter of urgency. Despite working with IBERIA their requests were met with the same dismissive and unhelpful attitude I have already described.

 The very people at SWISSPORT, hired to handle this disgusting airline, were also appalled at the extent of the damage and inconvenience IBERIA keeps causing the people who travel with their airline. The ladies went out of their way to help but IBERIA refused to listen and to accept responsibility for their ridiculous lack of service.
IBERIA’S staff both at the call centre (THE LANDLINE ONE)and in Madrid on the ground are RUDE, ABRUPT, UNWILLING TO ASSIST and downright LAZY!!!!! Let’s also not forget that their inability to PROFICIENTLY communicate in English only adds to the frustration of already disgruntled travellers!

Following a request both from SWISSPORT and from us to address our concerns and process a refund for costs incurred (over 200 EUROS) on their account, IBERIA replied:

“We apologise for the inconvenience caused in relation to the cancellation of flight IB3255 on 12/05/2018.
Airlines are affected may factors, such as weather conditions and air control permissions.
 
We understand that these circumstances make travelling more tiring, and although the reasons are beyond our control we do everything within our power to minimise the inconvenience.

2) We weren’t seated together despite being on the same booking (this was rectified by asking a passenger to swap) 
3) seats are TINY & uncomfortable. Leg room is non existent. Both my husband and I are 170cm and my knees were touching the seat in front after i placed a book in the seat pocket!  
4) food & beverages offered were terrible 
5) bad communication - flight departing Athens was a little delayed & we had to run between gates at Madrid to board our flight to Lisbon (30 min between flights instead of the scheduled 60). We already had boarding passes. We double checked that our bags would make the connection - this was confirmed. 
6) upon landing - no bags! they didn’t even try to get it on the plane. We were told they were already on the next flight over & would be delivered to our hotel that night. This threw out our plans for the night completely. Bags thankfully arrived intact 6 or so hours later. 

Lisbon to Paris 
1) flight cancelled (via text) less than 24 hours before. We were out of Lisbon on a day trip with limited/no WiFi access and I didn’t receive the cancellation email till much later that night. 
2) automatically rebooked on a flight for a day later (36 hours after original flight)  - Iberia had our customer details, phone numbers etc but NO explanation was offered for flight cancellation. We already had prepaid accommodation and activities in Paris for the final 3 nights of our honeymoon & had to travel on the day as planned or would have forfeited our accommodation. 
3) they did not tell us that all Iberia flights to Paris that day were cancelled. They did not tell us their budget airline was flying that day, when we asked they wouldn’t put us on that flight. 
4) They refused to allow us to board the flight to Madrid (which was not cancelled) so we could look at other alternatives from Madrid to Paris. Ground staff were shockingly rude and unhelpful. Their attitude was “wait till tomorrow or buy another flight” 
5) their help line is not in English - there is no press “x” for English option. We ended up googling for a US help desk and spoke to a gentlemen who at least told us what our flight options were (budget airline). 

In the end we purchased new tickets with another airline who got us on the earliest available direct flight and we arrived in Paris earlier than we had planned. This allowed us to go to the Iberia desk at CGD. Again, unhelpful. No one could tell us how to lodge a claim, or where to do it. Finally (after 45 min of confusion & being sent around from desk to desk) we were told it was an online system. No apology. No acknowledgement of their poor communication. 

Fortunately we weren’t restricted monetarily and could purchase alternate flights - I would have been gutted to have missed (or cut short our time in Paris). 

We filed an online claim that day, with evidence of our pre-booked itinerary and activities and why we needed to travel that particular day. Some 10 days later, a generic email was sent to my husband - basically saying “too bad, we don’t do refunds if you choose not to take the flights we gave you”. No compensation for the time/money lost, no explanation why they wouldn’t let us fly halfway to Madrid. Nothing. And best of all, the email is generated and sent via a “no reply” email so there’s no option for follow up/appeal. So dodgy. Their business practices are questionable. I am truly surprised at the positive feedback this airline receives. You couldn’t pay me enough money to fly Iberia again. 

Both my husband & I are platinum one world frequent flyers - the service (or lack of) that we experienced with Iberia was appalling. It is the worst flying experience ever, just unhelpful and thoughtless and money grabbing. We will never fly Iberia again.",November 2017,"May 24, 2018",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,

"Awful, just awful",Naples,New York City,International,"I've seen people give Iberia good reviews, but I cannot for the life of my figure out why. 
 Unless you plan on taking a short domestic flight within Europe, I would never recommend flying Iberia.  As an expat, I fly international back to the States quite a bit and Iberia is the second worst airline I've ever flown (#1 is Austrian Air).  I flew Naples to JFK and here were the problems I experienced: 1) Could not check-in online prior to arriving at the airport (and I tried multiple times); 2) the seats in Economy were SO small; virtually no legroom (I couldn't even put a book in the seat pocket in front of me or my knees would've been hitting it- I'm 5'8"") or space between your seat partner; 3) seats were incredibly uncomfortable, like sitting on a piece of wood; 4) awful food; I'm a vegetarian, but they ran out of pasta by the time they got to me, so I was given the meatball plate. I did not eat the meatballs but will tell you that the rest of the plate was not good: stale tasting bread, a corn salad and a minuscule piece of apple ""cake"".  And although I didn't eat the meatballs, my seatmate said they were disgusting.  We also only had 1 drink provided w/ the dinner, no follow-up 2nd drink when collecting trash (I have always gotten a 2nd drink on every other intl flight); 5) unhelpful staff: when requesting a pasta choice/saying I was vegetarian, the attendant was incredibly rude & would not give me any kind of different food (any extra bread, chips, anything) but instead snarkily told me that I should have selected my food online before flying. Well, that would have been great, if their POS website actually worked. I also asked a diff attendant for another glass of wine (since we weren't given but 1 drink) and her response was incredibly short, telling me that I'd have to go to the back of the plane and ask for it (they can't even bring someone a drink to their seat?) and also I'd have to wait until such and such time; 6) Dirty bathrooms

The only reason I'm giving this airline 2 stars is because the ride was smooth (so really this is a star to the pilot, not the airline) and there was a USB port and movies to watch inflight (although the movie options were less than stellar compared to other airlines).

Rude ground crew in San Jose Costa Rica,San Jose,Paris,International,"Originally booked a premium economy seat, however this particular airplane only had business and economy. Due to a herniated disc I could not fly economy and needed extra leg room, hence the paying more for premium. upon check in, the ground personal refused to honor the seating and would not upgrade us into business, even tho we were willing to pay the additional on top of the premium. they told us to call a number. we asked to borrow their land line as our mobile phones did not work in costa rica, they refused. I had to ask for management and create s bit of a stir to get one sympathetic person to hand over a land line for us to make the call. in the end the people on the phone helped us get our upgrade a ta minimal fee. one of the ground personal had the tenacity to scold me and attempt to preach to me about my visa requirements for entering Europe as an american beaus i had no return ticket.

Medellín to Madrid: Avianca now has competition with Iberia,Medellin,Madrid,International,"At last posing much needed competition with Avianca for the direct flight from Medellín to Madrid, we were happy to try Iberia for the first time. 
In Business Class, Iberia has followed the trend in seat configuration using angled seats, alternating by row, one seat on either window side and two in the center. The effect is to provide considerable privacy, making each seat almost a private niche, not conducive for those who enjoy socializing with other passengers.

In Medellín we had access to the lounge shared with Panama's Copa Airlines. It must be rather new, since there were no Iberia markings at reception and it was a trek to find. The lounge is spartan, with perfunctory snacks offered at one far end. At the other end, a bar will furnish complementary drinks.

Iberia's seats were more comfortable in my opinion than Avianca's, where leg-room was cramped in flat-bed selection, and rising from the seat awkward.  Iberia flies Airbus A330, Avianca uses Airbus A320. At the time I believe we actually paid less for the Iberia roundtrip than Avianca's best price, however, it appears now that Iberia's fares may be several hundred dollars higher.

Meals on Iberia are expedited by serving appetizer and main course together on one tray, with dessert separate. Food was not remarkably tasty, and certainly not exceptional.

Comfortable in my seat, I slept from after dinner until breakfast. Service was professional and responsive, unlike my experience with Avianca, where I felt ignored and remarked the crew spent most of the flight chatting in the galley without once checking on passenger needs, at least in my case.

It is fortunate, in far-flung Colombia to have a choice of airlines flying non-stop to Madrid and a number of U.S. destinations, without changing planes in Bogotá. As Medellín grows in technology and prestige we hope to see more direct flight opportunities.

Old aircraft and rammed in like cattle,Madrid,London,Europe,"We were returning from Turin but due to an Air Traffic Control strike our return flight (BA2579) was cancelled. We were delayed by one day and had to return via Madrid. The flight from Turin to Madrid was by Air Nostrum and was excellent in all aspects. More so when you consider that Air Nostrum is a budget airline. Well done guys.
The flight from Madrid to London Heathrow was by Iberia and was awful. I had to sit sideways as I could not get my legs into a normal seating  position due to the highly restricted seat pitch. How I could have got out in an emergency is a frightening thought. Other aspects of this flight were normal for European economy flights. Check-in was OK, the flight was punctual and the cabin staff pleasant.
Madrid airport was really good with a good choice of shops and food outlets all of whom had good food for sale. We all eat very well and at a reasonable cost.

"If your final destination is not MADRID, forget flying Iberia.",Miami,Amsterdam,International,"I flew Iberia from  Miami to Amsterdam. Service in coach has never been good in Iberia but it has continued to decay. As soon as the plane stabilized at its cruising altitude the meal (4 mini meatballs with roasted potatoes) was not served but handed out to the passengers. The flight attendants attitude was arrogant. After the brief meal interlude the attendants went to sleep in the rear of the plane and were out of sight until one hour before landing when they came out in a foul mood to serve breakfast. No cocktails were served on this 8 hour flight. Breakfast was inedible but I admit that coffee was offered twice. 

I missed the connecting flight in Madrid because going from one gate to another in the beautiful but dysfunctional  Terminal 4 of Madrid Barajas airport can take over 40 minutes. An agent on the arrival gate handed red connecting cards to passengers like me to expedite transit through immigration and security but they were ignored by the immigration and security staff.  We arrived three minutes late to our connecting flight! The gate agent directed us to the customer service desk (another 20 minutes walk) There I found that I was one of hundreds that lost their connection. A photo of the customer service desk that was manned by only two nice but poorly trained employees is shown below. You can see the crowd of frustrated passengers trying to beat the line. After standing for an hour in line It took the agent 40 minutes and three interventions by  the supervisor go get me on a flight 12 hours later. On the positive side I must admit that I received a meal voucher for McDonalds. 
I am fully bilingual so I managed to present my case convincingly. I tried to help some English speaking travelers that were in the same predicament because the agents English was rudimentary and could not communicate well in English.

A very travel savvy person might have become suspicious because the confirmation e-mail didn't contain an e-ticket yet, I have learnt that lesson only now (after many dozens of bookings with other airlines without problems). It seems very much like Iberia use this practice to overbook their flights without officially overbooking them: keeping customers standby all the time until the flight, charging them if there is a seat, letting them down if there isn't then legally avoiding to pay any compensation.

I did say that I wanted a refund instead of a rescheduled flight but I have not received a refund or any information regarding it.

Flightmare,Alicante,New York City,International,"We flew from Alicante to Madrid with one of their subsidiaries which was fine but the Madrid to JFK section was miserable because of the short time between arrival and departure and the long distance between terminals we didn’t get time for a drink having left home at 6 am. Boarding the plane we were denied the seats we had paid €160 extra for as we wheelchair loaded and these seats are by the emergency exits. Quite where they would put put you if you were unable to walk at all. I don’t know. We were on that plane for an hour and a half before the meal service with no drinks. Then we could only get cold drinks as they wouldn’t serve hot due to turbulence. There was no drinks service at then they served snacks about an hour before we landed.

We were seated close to the galley area where some of the flight attendants were hiding.  I saw a few passengers approach them and the interaction, in our impression, looked as though they were rudely turned away.

Worst service ever,Boston,Berlin,International,"Via BravoFly I've booked a round-trip from Berlin to Boston and back. The flight to Boston was via British Airways and everything went perfect. The flight back was theoretically booked with Iberia but operated by Level. First time I've heard about this company. Problems started at the online check-in the day before departure when I wasn't able to pick my seat. At the Boston Airport the Level/ Iberia desk wasn't able to print my connection boarding pass from Barcelona to Berlin. The plane, a pretty new Airbus 330-200, had the worst seating I've ever experienced for an overseas flight. The crew was unprofessionally acting and pretty unfriendly. After an untasty meal I wasn't asked once again about water or coffee during the whole flight. In Barcelona we had an outher parking position, which I also experienced the first time on an international flight. Connecting flight to Berlin wasn't operated by Iberia either, but by Vueling. 
All in one miserable and respectless service by Iberia.

TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,New York City,Naples,International,"The absolute worst customer service I have ever seen in my entire life. They do not care about you or your well being or even what you’re doing in life. They only care about money and that’s it. The airline is complete trash.. I asked the front desk clerk if we could upgrade and she rudely responded with no and told me to move aside. 
I said I want to pay to be upgraded and she disregarded me and my wife completely. So I figured hey she’s having a bad day and we will just go get on. Then I come to find out, after asking the flight attendant if we could upgrade, that she was lying and there were seats available. Apparently she just didn’t care about us or maybe it was the fact that we were American. I may be American but I have thick Argentinan blood and speak great Spanish, I just choose not to when you can speak English. I used maybe I should have. THEN on the next flight it happened AGAIN. Another front desk woman said no we could not upgrade after offering to pay when there 7 business class tickets available. LOL. ARE YOU JOKING. What kind of terrible business is this???? You don’t want more money??? THEN!!!! We went to a customer service desk.. explained the whole situation and what has happened and the guy the was chuckling and telling me that we were wrong and if we need to file a complaint then do so online. So I am going to every single social media outlet I can to say that this is the worst ABSOLUTE WORST AIRLINE EVER.

Very Good All Around Experience,Madrid,New York City,International,"Wife and I returned to US on Wed May 9th and had a very positive experience. Clean airplane (A330-600) attentive and good bi lingual (Spanish / English) cabin staff always willing, helpful, and cheerful. All seats had packaged pillows and blankets of good quality on seat cushions. Seat widths and leg room were noticeablywider and longer than our other experiences on 4 other carriers, 2 US, 2 European. Two meals were served and soft drinks always available by stretching one’s legs and asking at the mid cabin and rear kitchens. Meals were good and superior to American carriers. Movie stelection was good but the music was very much weighed toward European listener. WiFi connection for tablets was $10 US. Since I have my head in the Internet too much I chose the movies. We had connected to this flight from 1 1/2 hour Malaga leg that had no beverage offerings but had free WiFi and equally well maintained aircraft and pleasant cabin crew. Flying to Spain on the BA overnight booking I cannot fairly compare as BA overnight flight to Heathrow was 2 hours shorter and spent sleeping. No problems with checked baggage delivered picked up promptly at  the British Airways Terminal 7 at JFK. This itself is worth the Iberia choice in order to avoid the ususal US Customs line of seemingly thousands at JFK Int’l Arrivals Bldg (Terminal 1 ?). I would not hesitate to fly with Iberia again based on our experiences on these two flights, one short haul one long haul, carrying us home.",May 2018,"May 12, 2018",4.0,,,,,,,,
Nearly Made Us Miss Our Connecting Flight,Cape Town Central,Madrid,International,"Had connecting flight in Johannesburg between Cape Town and Madrid.  We arrived in Cape Town four hours before our flight and had ample time checking in so we made sure our luggage was checked all the way to Madrid.  Once we arrived in Johannesburg with only 1.5 hour between flights however we were told we had not been checked in all the way through Madrid even though our luggage were.  After a 20-25 minute delay they said we would be on standby for the connecting flight to Madrid.  We reminded them that our luggage were already on that flight and they either had the choice of pulling our luggage out (the law says luggage cannot fly without the owners) or that we had to be on that flight.  It was not our fault they made the mistake.  They finally found space for us on the flight (later on we saw empty seats on that flight so I don't know why we went through all of this in the first place).  
By then however it was so close to departure time that we were told to run which we started doing immediately.  Meanwhile, they had called someone to help get us there quicker.  I was told to sit in the wheelchair by staff and pretend I needed it so they could get me through security faster.  I eventually obliged but I don't like to lie so it felt very weird to do that.  Once through we were asked for money for that 'service'.  Again, since it was not our mistake to start with, we did not want to pay.  We thought this helped us go through faster until we saw the guy that was at the ticket counter at the same time as us, was ahead of us.  It was all a ploy to get money from us.  At least we made it to our flight with not a second to spare.
Once in Madrid we kept waiting for one of our two suitcase.  After the luggage carousel stopped turning, indicating that no more luggage was coming out, we asked Iberia staff about our missing luggage and their answer was that it had to be on that carousel and that we should just wait.  We waited another 20 minutes (for now a total of one hour after the belt had stopped running).  We then asked again and the lady at the counter was extremely rude and did not believe us.  She kept saying we didn't know where to look (she didn't know I understood Spanish and kept saying stuff under her breath to coworkers).  We pushed the issue so she finally came to the carousel and saw no luggage.  We kept saying it was probably stuck on the ramp going up to the belt but she didn't believe us.  She finally called someone to check and wouldn't you know it, our luggage was stuck on the ramp going up.

Poor service.,London,Buenos Aires,International,"Considering this was a thirteen and a half hour flight during daylight hours for the whole duration I was surprised how inattentive the cabin crew were. They were friendly enough but at no time during the flight except at meal times did they offer you a drink of any sort. You could always help yourself by walking to the galley area and perhaps that was the hidden agenda, viz. encouraging passengers to get out of their seats and stretch their legs, but that wasn’t the impression I got.

Negligent and incompetent!,Florence,Madrid,Europe,"Iberia cancelled it’s flight Florence-Madrid one and a half hours after it was supposed to depart. They gave passengers the option to take a bus to Bologna to connect then to Madrid. Problem was (besides the bus driver talking on the phone during the1 1/2 hour ride), that there was nobody with  the wheelchair I had requested when we arrived at the Bologna airport parking lot! I am not only a senior citizen, but I am disabled! Iberia totally disregarded or forgot my request!!! I was forced to walk to the Iberia counter with great difficulty and in great pain! To top it all off, when we got to the boarding gate for disabled passengers, and waited for 45 minutes to be taken to the plane, the guy in charge of pushing the wheelchair told us,  that he  could not board us because our Iberia flight  had Left and so he had to take us back to the terminal!!!!
We were not late, we saw on the monitor that the Iberia plane was leaving on time, later that they were boarding and later that it was closing its doors! We saw all that on the monitor! Iberia just disregarded us and took off leaving us behind, leaving me in a wheelchair in an empty airport! No excuse, no explanation!

That showed me the  sense of responsability of the airline and crew. Even though this delayed our take off like 11 minutes we still arrived on time to our destiny.

Delay handled poorly. Will not fly Iberia again,Paris,San Jose,International,"Our flight to Paris was wonderful but I am disappointed to say that I cannot recommend Iberia due to their lack of organization after a mechanical failure which could have been handled much better. 

We arrived at the airport at 4:30am and waited until check in at 5:15. This process seemed to take longer than usual but we made it through security and were at the gate with plenty of time to spare. Boarding was scheduled for 7:00 and that time came and went before we heard the news that we would be leaving late. We were told that an update would be given in 15 minutes. 

15 minutes later we were still delayed but would receive more information in 30 minutes. 30 minutes later we were told there was a mechanical issue and would receive more information in 45 minutes. 45 minutes later we were told that we were still delayed but that no new information was available but that we could go get breakfast at a restaurant on an upper level and come back in an hour for more information. Many of us were worried about missing connections but the airline attendants making the announcements were dismissive and we were told that once we got to Madrid they would arrange everything. 

The breakfast line was long and we could only choose from a croissant and hot drink per person. No water or juice for my 5 year old, who ended up eating both croissants leaving me with no food. 

There were still no new details by 12:30pm although we were told we would receive new information every hour. By 1 we were told that we would board at 1:45 because the mechanical issue had been fixed. Once again we were sent upstairs for lunch to get a sandwich and drink. We waited 45 minutes in line for a sandwich and cold drink, making it back just in time to sit around for another 15 minutes for them to begin boarding. 

When we arrived in Madrid, +45 passengers stood around the information desk to receive vouchers. French support was not provided  to those who only spoke this language and were very frustrated with the wait time and changes being offered by Iberia. But this was only the beginning. 

We were given boarding passes for flights rescheduled for the next day as well as a voucher. This voucher said we were provided accommodation in ""unknown hotel"", dinner, breakfast and two calls. By law this is the bare minimum. When asked which hotel, the attendants simply said, ask downstairs. When asked where the bus was, the attendants simply said, ask downstairs. Our bags would travel directly to our destination so we were without a change of clothes, toothbrush, deodorant and all our other items for the night. 

I headed downstairs with my son to look for the bus. I found another Iberia attendant on the way and asked but she also said to ask downstairs. At around 4:30 we got downstairs and there were several buses but none said they would be taking us and to ask Iberia. I chatted up some of the other passengers who were also frustrated and a few of us went up to ask at the desk. The desk attendant said that it would be in lane 1 so to head down there. There was no bus in lane 1. Another passenger mentioned it would be lane 7 so we went there only to find out that it did not leave until 6pm and didn't know where we were going.

6:00 finally came around and a random man showed up, asked if we were waiting for a hotel and opened the bus doors. My son was pushed to the ground and his finger stepped on when the mob tried to all pile onto the bus at the same time. The person showing us to the bus did not allow the people with accessibility assistance (in wheelchairs) to board first. We did not know if there was another bus if we were not able to all fit on the first one. 

Two more buses showed up and we asked where we were going, to which we were simply told, the hotel. Had the bus flipped over and something happened to the driver, we would have all been stranded without any idea of where we were going. 

We drove for an hour and 20 minutes before reaching our destination in Toledo. We checked in and when asked about our shuttle to the airport, the desk clerk suggested that we ask the person organizing it because she had no details on our return to the airport. I had to explain that there was absolutely no organization whatsoever and she agreed to contact the company who brought us to the hotel to organize it. 

The rooms were nice enough and we were able to have two meals and upon asking again at the front desk were told that the shuttle would be there at 8am. 

8am came around and the first buses were full. I had learned my lesson with getting in line and decided to wait so that the mass could get on first to avoid getting trampled on. We got two spaces on the 3rd and last bus, which took its sweet time leaving. The driver wasn't sure everyone was on the bus. The hotel had even less of an idea if everyone had left. We urged the driver that with the 1.5 hour bus ride, we were barely going to get to the airport in time and seeing as there was no way to find out if anyone was missing, he reluctantly started driving. 

From a customer service perspective, things could have been handled so much better on Iberia's behalf to avoid frustration, confusion, injury, etc. Vouchers could have bene handed out in an organized manner. An attendant could have accompanied the group to the bus or to a designated spot for the other company to pick us up. More information could have made this a painless transition. But instead, police were called because some customers got too frustrated with non-answers and it was a stressful almost 12 hours for all of us. 

Also, it turns out that the mechanical failure had occurred the night before and the airline knew it wouldn't be fixed in time because of a lengthy process to approve the flight, yet refused to provide additional information to any of us and left us all with a bad experience.

I also ordered a special meal Indian..guess what I received: salad as a starter as well as the main meal !: I returned it for a regular meal.The other problem is that Iberia arrives in Terminal 4, which is an issue  as its a good 20 minutes from other Terminals 1,2, & 3 (all of which are connected). This could be a problem if you have a connection from the other terminals or are meeting another passenger arriving at another terminal, as was the case with me.

Obviously the ""refund department"" is a secret thing that cannot be reached under any mean. This company ignores not only their customers but also the aviation laws.

Our flight with Iberia was horrendous. We had a 5 hours delay without any explanation nor apologises. During the 5 hours, no food/water was given, as the law request. The vegetarian meal I had ordered was non-existent, they gave me banana instead (for a 10hour flight). The staff was extremely rude throwing biscuits at our faces and making racist comments. When we finally arrived to our destination, our 4 bags were lost. it was extremely difficult to contact their customer service to know where our bags were.

Mid range good price,Johannesburg,Prague,International,"As Iberia was for price and duration of flights the best option for my trip to Prague I decided to give it a try and book. I then read so many negative reviews that I was really a bit aprehensive but openminded. The aircrafts were  all new and very neat and I loved the bright red trimmings of the cabin. Legroom was for me adequite although I am not a tall person. For my partner, a tall person, legroom was average or maybe a teeny bit less for economy.What was a negative for him was that the seats where thin and not the best comfort. A big thing on the negative side was that I did not pay extra for a selected seat when booking, as I thought we would at least be able to select for free when online check in opens 24h before the flight.That was not an option with online check in, and then even when we arrived at the counter 3.5 hours before our flight we where not able to get one window seat. The food at dinner was not the best,but not at all that bad, except for breakfast where a bun with ham and cheese and hardly any butter, was served ice cold. It could have been much better if heated up a bit like we are used to. It was presented with yoghurt juice/coffee/tea and bonus a kit-kat! So could have been much better with a little effort! During the night there was no service of even water at all and in the morning it was about 1hour 20 min. before landing time when there was any movement from the service cabin crew!

Aweful expereince flying and customer care,Brussels,La Coruna,Europe,"The worst flight I have experienced. I was travelling for business from Brussels to La Coruna for 1 day carrying hand bag.

When the had bag arrived, the bag wheel was missing. I filed complained and was asked to send all documents with new bag receipt. I have sent everything via email but did not receive any response for next 2 months. I'm trying to call them, at least 15 times, get hold of their contact center finally who said - you can do nothing but wait for an answer.

Ridiculous Flight Attendants,Barcelona,Madrid,Domestic,"The flight started out like any other flight with an overhead message to store larger luggage in the overhead bins and smaller items under the seat in front of you.

Once the flight finally got underway, I put on my headphones and began watching a movie on my phone. After about 30 minutes into my movie, another flight attendant came by and told me I couldn’t use my headphones because I was in an emergency exit aisle and might miss instructions if something went wrong. Of course, the 2 guys that were stone cold asleep across the aisle from me apparently didn’t pose a problem in regard to instructions during a potential disaster.

About and hour before arrival to and from my destination they fed us another light meal.  All the flight attendants were attentive and my luggage arrived in both places no problems.

Worst Experince Ever BAD BAD BAD,Madrid,Marrakech,International,"DONT EVER USE THESE GUYS. 

Lost my hand luggage after insisting I checked it in. 
Gave a reference number for a claim. You must enter it when you call them. Gave me the runaround for over 2 months calling every day then would not let me speak to anyone cos the ref number expired and you cannot talk to someone without a ref number. They kept telling me they would call me back but no one did. Not even once. They also promised to reimburse me for anything I had to buy as a result of them loosing my luggage. They did not even reimburse my medicine.  They COMPLETELY RUINED my holiday. 
SO SO angry. What a disgusting, disguting, terrible  company. I hope they go bankrupt. Cannot express enough how angry I am with the way I was treated. Ignored all my emails. I absolutely hate them.

God help you if you lose your luggage on Iberia,Madrid,Granada,Domestic,Iberia lost both our bags.  Worst communication possible. Repeated calls to their service number no help. My calls in English were never directed to the right department despite speaking to English speaking reps. Gave up after 5 calls. Local hotel got through on phone but got no info on status of our bags. Website that provided status equally unhelpful.  Would not have got our bags if not for local hotel staff who arranged for luggage to be couriered from hotel we had left after Iberia had basically just dropped off our bags at a hotel they knew we had left.   Will try to get reimbursed by Iberia for courier cost as well as clothing purchases during 3 days without luggage but not optimistic based on experiences to date.

If I could give minus rating I would,Madrid,London,Europe,"The flight was ok, apart from the lack of legroom. Staff quite friendly, no complaints there. 

The booking experience was something else. When I made the booking I wrote the name, exactly as it's written in the passport, as requested. There must be something wrong with their website because instead of the middle name being in the middle it came out after the surname. So I rang 'customer service' and was told that it would be sorted out. I checked a few days later and it was still the same, so I called 'customer service' and spoke to a woman who said it was my fault and I had to pay 30 euros or she wouldn't change the name, 'take it or leave it'.

So I paid the money, next day no change, so I called them again the next day and was told it would be changed, still no change. So I called them twice more, now I was starting to worry because the flight was 2 days away. This time I was ranting a bit because I had no faith that it would be sorted out and was panicking. It was eventually changed. 

Just know that you can't expect the information you end up with to be the same as you typed in.

Iberia business ? No gratias !!,Madrid,Athens,Europe,"Question?
How come Iberia which enjoys a great terminal in Madrid T4 with good business class lounge and planes leave on time but as soon you are on board , it’s  a different story !
Same seats as the economy class at least one in the middle is empty !
Crew : seems not happy to work there .
The worst is the level of service for a business class passenger !
Food : the product is so badly designed ,presented it looks like the economy one served years ago ! Imagine what it will be if they have to offer today some food in economy class ??  It’s not that it’s a bad quality  , it s  seems to me that they don’t want  to spend , beside for the minimum .( hello !!   ) 
It’s just not acceptable 
In my opinion it’s the worst  business  .
Luckily, in economy they don’t give any free meals on this flight so you can only buy it ,at least you get what you pay for, and it’s better, which is not the case in business class .
Obviously only thing which seems  to count for IB there is to cut costs and it’s at the expenses of the passengers !!
On my return flight on Aegean grecque airline it was the opposite .

When we questioned the agent at the airport about the additional costs we had paid, she handed us a complaint form to fill out for possible reimbursement.  Explanation we were given was that 'Perhaps there was a plane change.'  Sure, like I'm going to believe that.  Then during flight we were served some sort of sandwich.  Mind you, I was half-asleep when served so I didn't really look to see what it was.

The worst airline ever -  Iberia,Madrid,Miami,International,"Before flying on Iberia, I thought Spirit was the worst airline I ever used.  Iberia now takes first place. Iberia flies from Spain and to and from many Latin America countries.
My wife and I booked a flight from Barcelona, Spain to Miami, which had a stopover in Madrid.  When we got to Barcelona airport, there were no signs when you get in the terminal directing you to any airline.  So we walked all around and finally saw 2 signs with agents for Iberia.  There was about a dozen people waiting there, so we though this wasn't so bad.  After waiting there for about 25 minutes, someone walked by us and asked us where we were going. I said Madrid.  She says, "" You have to go to another area, this is the wrong Iberia area for that.""  They were too cheap and lazy to put up a sign say this.
Then we found the right area, way down the corridor.  There was maybe 100 people waiting there.  We were waiting about an hour, when an agent from the priority line called a group of us over.  We waited on that line for about 20 minutes, and when we got to the front of the line, and the agent saw it was 9 AM and our flight was not until 12 PM, she told us to wait on the other line. We got so mad, I started yelling at another agent to help us, which she did.  Totally disorganized agents.
Then we got our tickets, which only had a letter A on the gate area.  Usually there is a letter and a number.  But I thought, hey, maybe in Spain they don't use numbers with the letter.  We walked a long way, following the signs for  "" A"" and then saw all the gates had numbers after the letter "" A "".  I found an agent and asked him where is "" A"", and he tells me, "" Go down all the way to the end.""  We did, and found that "" A"" was  "" A 1 "".  Now why didn't they put A1 on the ticket ?  Another unsolved mystery.
The flight to Madrid was uneventful.  After arriving there, we look at out tickets to Miami, and again, no gate number, only a letter "" S"".  There a sign that says "" S"" will be 24 minutes away.  That involved a very long walk and a train ride to the opposite end of this giant airport.  Now we think "" S"" must be S 1 from the way these airports run here in Spain. It took about 45 minutes before we reached S 1.  When we got there was no one there. I walked to an Iberia desk far away from the gate, asked the agent where "" S "" was, and he looks at my ticket and say, "" You have to go to "" S 47 .""  That was at the far end of that level.  I asked why the gate number was not on the ticket, and he says, "" They don't put the gate number on there, you have to find out from another agent.""  Pure stupidity.
Now we have to walk about 20 minutes to the opposite end of that level. When we get there, there are 3 agents standing there, sort of like security, making sure no one enters that area unless they have a ticket for that gate.  I asked the agent if the tickets with no gate numbers is the way Spain operates it's airports, or is the just Iberia.  He says, "" It's just Iberia.""
The food places at this airport was one overpriced junk place after another, so we didn't buy anything for the plane.  After all, all international flights give you two meals, and the one we came to Barcelona on , American Airlines, was decent.  But these people love their meat.  So much that you will see places carving meat from the leg of the animal, with the animal's hoof high in the air.  Disgusting for an airport.  
We had the back seats on the flight, which has it's good and bad.  At dinner time, the attendant gives my wife and I tray.  I look inside the main dish, it was nothing but some pasta and some red sauce.  Then there was a roll that was ice cold.  Then there was some kind of salad with couscous and beans, about 3 inches square, and a dried out piece of cake, about 2 inches square.  I called this attendant back, and asked her if there was something else besides pasta, and she said no and walked away. My wife and don't eat pasta, and though this was the worst meal we ever got.  It was a tray of cheap carbohydrates.  My wife asked me how people eat an ice cold roll.  I told her to sit on it, it will get warm.  I can bet my life the pilots and the attendants didn't eat this garbage.
I called over another attendant, this one a male, and asked him if there was anything else besides pasta. These attendants were all Spanish, and spoke some English.  He assumed I was an American who didn't speak Spanish.  He asked another female attendant in Spanish if they had anymore chicken, and she said there was no more.  He tells me, "" That's all we have. ""  He didn't think I understood what he asked in Spanish, but I can speak some Spanish.  Now I knew that there was a chicken dish, but they ran out of it, and gave us what they had left - the cheap carbohydrate tray.  We ate nothing.  We only drank soda and water.
About 5 hours later I went to the rear to use the bathroom and to throw out a soda can. There was a female attendant sitting there in a seat with her legs stretched out reading a newspaper, blocking me to the bathroom.  She tells me in Spanish, "" You have to stay in your seat.""  I told her I had to use the bathroom in Spanish, and now she gives me a disgusted look because she had to sit up and move her legs to let me walk by.  This is the kind of flight attendants they have.
The bathroom in mid flight was so disgusting and dirty.  Toilet paper everywhere.  I guess these flight attendants don't have to clean, and some of these people were disgusting slobs. 
The breakfast was even worse, so we ate nothing nothing for a 9 1/2 hour flight.  Then one of my luggage straps was stolen off my bag. I contacted them and they did nothing about everything.  Forget about Iberia.",April 2018,"May 2, 2018",1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0

Flight Heathrow to Lima via Madrid,London,Lima,International,"2 week holiday to Peru, for my wife and I, started on 5th April, with a 2 hour flight from Heathrow to Madrid on a BA flight which was fine.

The next element was an 11 hour flight from Madrid to Lima and I can honestly say it was the worst flight I have ever had.

The seats were close together - which, for an economy flight, was not totally unexpected, so cannot be criticised.

The three cabin staff serving our side of the plane, however, were barely civil - one female attendant made a point of looking away when serving requiring her customers to intercept food and drink in mid air.

The quality of the food was extremely poor and the meals barely edible.

After about 4 hours I made a trip to the toilet, which was disgusting - The bins were overflowing and the floor was strewn with paper towels and awash with, I dread to think. 

On exiting the cubicle there were two male attendants reading newspapers - I held the door of the cubicle open and indicated the mess, the only response being shrugged shoulders.

Normally, on a long haul flight the attendants bring round water or juice every hour or so - not Iberia - although when I went to their station and asked - I was given a cup of water.

Customer care is clearly not a criteria when Iberia recruit their staff.

The return trip was equally bad although having previous experience I made sure that I did not need to avail myself of their facilities.

When we booked the trip we were unaware that BA do operate a direct flight to Lima but only on 2 days a week.

It Was A Good Flight,Barcelona,Los Angeles,International,"The flight was fully booked so getting everyone on the plane in Barcelona was trying.

My wife and I had purchased a large bottle of water and some nuts to share on the flight since we usually do this on long flights. It's a good thing we did because unless you pre-ordered any beverages or food, you got nothing for the next 11-1/2 hours. I've flown Iberia before and they usually served us two meals plus separate beverage service a couple of times.

A Long Trip Home,Madrid,Vienna,Europe,"We had travelled to Madrid on return tickets. While we had seat tickets on our trip to Madrid, we were given standby tickets when we checked in for the return trip to Vienna. It was perplexing to say the least, but they told us that having seat ticket on the way in doesn't mean we'll get them on the way back.

As it was, we weren't able to get on the plane we had tickets for and were directed to Iberia's compensation and rebooking desk. The lady there was quite pleasant and gave us 400 Euros each for compensation and got us onto a flight later in the day. She also gave us meal vouchers to use in the terminal. After that, she sent us up one floor to Iberia's ticket desk where we could collect our boarding passes.

We waited for five hours in the terminal before boarding an Iberia A319 Airbus that was every bit as cramped as the one we'd flown in on. Iberia took us to Berlin-Tegel airport, where we waited for another two hours for an Austrian Airlines flight to Vienna.

Sadly, the only good comments I can make about Iberia are with regards to their compensation and rebooking services. However, I suspect they may have a lot of practice handing out refunds and new tickets given how the rest of our experience went with them.

DO NOT FLY IBERIA,Miami,Madrid,International,"Never in my life have I witnessed such incompedence in an airline. I will NEVER fly Iberia again. 

We missed our connecting flight to Barcelona from Madrid because the Iberia representative told us the wrong gate and only had an hour layover. Then when we attempted to change to a different flight we were told we would have to book an entire new flight because you used Vueling, but we wouldn’t even be able to fly out that day so we would have to drive!

So we waited 2 hrs to receive our bags only to find out you shipped them to Barcelona without us!

So we drove 6 hrs to Barcelona (spending hundreds on a rental) because you wouldn’t change our flights. We get to the Barcelona airport and THE BAGS ARE IN MADRID. 

EVERY PERSON WE TALKED TO TOLD US A DIFFERENT STORY AND PROMISED OUR BAGS WERE ON THE WAY.

Fast forward to the next day we called and you promised the bags would be here by 9AM. Confirmed on the flight. It’s now 10:10 we are at the airport and you told us THEY MISSED THE FLIGHT. But here’s the kicker... WE FOUND ONE OF THEM AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THE SECOND ONE IS. 

I AM IN SHOCK. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. 

Numerous times I told your staff we are leaving on a cruise today and the bags need to be here in the morning so we can get onto the cruise ship with our clothes! I am about to go on a cruise with no clothes and it’s completely the fault of your company and it’s staff.

This review is about their customer service and website.,Newark,Paris,International,"JUST DONT PURCHASE A TICKET THROUGH THIS COMPANY.

I received  NO confirmation that a flight was booked until a transaction showed up on my credit card several days later. Save yourself the misery of being passed around by their customer service and the multiple calls you will have to make to hopefully get a refund.!!!!  Excuses consist of “system isn’t working"", "" the supervisor is only here from 6am-3pm, ""the supervisor is only here from 8am-3pm"". I was sporadically hung up on. When I asked to review them. I was not given a website. I was met with an accusatory tone form ""Magadalen"" and another man when I was told its too late for a refund! Even though I called in the 24 hour period!

 I booked a flight on 9/8 from EWR to PARIS and then back from PARIS to EWR. Two separate one way tickets for my boy friend and I. Great deal $306 for both tickets per person. I NEVER received a confirmation form my flight from EWR - ORY (Paris). I called Level for help. Their staff is all Spanish speaking. No one can quickly and concisely help you if you are speaking English.. On 4/8/18 at 4:04 pm I called Iberia for help. A man instructed me that the purchase did not go through and to re purchase the ticket. I called my bank and confirmed that the purchase did not go through. I re purchased again. The man insured I would be reimbursed if the charge appeared on my account later..  I repurchased the ticket through the man with Iberia. I Still DID NOT receive confirmation that this ticket ( for the second time ) was purchased until 2 days later. If you use their website to confirm the booking - good luck by my tickets never showed up under “my booking”.  This time two transactions showed up on my card 2 DAYS LATER ON APRIL 10TH. April 13th two more charges appeared.

I decided to cancel the flights on APRIL 8th in the 24 hour period. I canceled because of the additional time and cost it would take to get from home city to EWR. This cancelation was made less than 12 hours form the original purchase. I called on 4/8/18 at 958 pm. The man could only see one of the tickets purchased. He was supposed to cancel the flight with the purchase that went though. HE said refund would be made in anywhere from 5-30 days? 5 - 30 days?! They should know when a refund will be made! It is APRIL 20th and I am still yet to receive a refund for the ticket from PARIS- EWR. For $314 dollars.

I called on 4/18/18. Magdalen was able to help me get a refund for the $148 that appeared on my bank statement on April 13th. I received and email with the refund receipt that same day I called April 18th. However the refund was for the incorrect amount. I then received a random $97 from Iberia. The refund receipt has no details or information on it. So I do not know where this $97 dollars is coming from!  I was under the impression that I would receive a refund receipt from the purchase on APRIL 8th and April 10th.  I am awaiting a call from the supervisor to find out why I have not received this refund. I have never called probably 10 times. This is the most exhausting and frustrating process I have ever went though with a company.",April 2018,"April 20, 2018",1.0,,,,1.0,1.0,,1.0,

Flown alot but Iberia takes the prize for WORST Airlines,Rome,Chicago,International,"I left Rome to fly back to the states with a layover in Madrid, Spain.  First, I relayed my concerns with the ticket agent in Rome that coming to Europe the layover of an hour just wasn't enough time with the distance from where both gates we're located because I nearly missed the connecting flight getting to Rome but the customer service with this airline is just horrible.  I get to Madrid and sprinted to catch the train to the C gates and made it to the gate with 15 minutes before the plane was scheduled to leave.  Another agent who lacked any customer service skills told me I was not on the connecting flight so she pointed me to the customer service booth.  I showed her my boarding pass with seat # and she didn't care.  I ended up staying overnight to get next flight out.  I tried to call Iberia customer service at the hotel and no # so I went to file a complaint through their website.  The site tries to deter you from filing a complaint with the many useless questions but I did and just saw a confirmation that they will respond asap.  Good thing I screenshot that because I never received an email from them.  I am disputing this with my bank and have them deal with this horrible airline.

What a shocker!,Madrid,London,Europe,"We were booked on Codeshare/Oneworld tickets for a return trip Madrid to London. Checkin at Madrid Airport was unbelievably poor. The staff were talking amongst themselves and seemed to delight in upsetting multiple passengers as they attempted to checkin.When our turn arrived we were told that the flight was full and we would be placed on standby - no reason offered. The checkin Iberia staff member was rude, unhelpful and disinterested. Our tickets had been issued in early January 2018. We were advised to go to the gate and see what happens. At the gate we were told the plane was full but we might get on the flight.Later we were informed one of us would be allowed to board and the other placed on a later flight. Then we were told that if we did get a seat on the plane we would not be sitting together(which did not matter to us). Finally we were told that we could board at the last minute. When we were on board the flight we noticed empty seats and believe it or in the same rows!
As I boarded I asked if our luggage would on the flight and was told by the Iberia staff member it would be.
We arrived in London only to find that one persons luggage had been loaded on board our flight.We were informed at Heathrow that the remaining bag was on the next flight from Madrid. After a nearly 2 hour wait at Heathrow thankfully the other case arrived.
Overall what had been a fantastic stay in Madrid was somewhat tarnished by the Iberia Airlines experience - unorganised and rude. The irony of this experience is that in the Iberia Airlines InFlight Magazine an interview with their Production Director was published. He spoke glowingly of how punctual the Airline was & ""commitment of staff to be the most punctual"" and how employees were ""the true agents in the achievement of company objectives.""
Based on our experience and the number of poor reviews on Tripadvisor maybe the Airline needs to review it's objectives and get back to polite customer service, avoid overbooking among other customer focused goals.",March 2018,"April 19, 2018",2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,4.0,1.0,

They filled our plane with cargo and left passengers bags at Madrid. They obviously have no morals or regard for providing even a basic standard of service. And forget booking and paying extra to select your seat because if someone pays more guess what you and your partner split up for a 10 hours flight, this was confirmed by checking agent.

Flight attendants intentionally do not assist non-Spanish speaking. Skips rows and do not come back to serve. I asked and attendant did not come back so I went to the back to ask and was waved off and told to wait.

Overbooking flight with no full refund and ground staff is nonsense,Lisbon,Madrid,Europe,"First of all, it all happens on 6th April 2018, when TAP airline from Lisbon -> Madrid flight was cancelled, thus resulting me making a new flight booking with your airline (Iberia airline).

We were schedule to fly on the 7th April from Lisbon -> Madrid, however we were told at our check-in counter that we are on STANDBY ticket. Which is totally unfair, as we paid the full amount, and as a result of your improper judgement of overbooking, we were told we can't board the flight to our next destination.

We were given a ""compensation ticket"", which your stupid staff at Lisbon counter are of NO HELP. Telling me to go to this counter at this row, and the other row, and NONE OF YOUR STAFF ARE TRAINED TO DEAL WITH THIS. If your staff can't assist guest, and/or are racist in my perspective, lazy and unwilling to work, they should not be there. Resulting, me unable to claim my compensation amount. 

If during the booking process at your website, shows or indicate any sign of OVERBOOKING or given me the option of being ON STANDBY, it would be my duty to be responsible for my own choices. However, your company happily accept the booking, made the check-in so proper and checking credit-card, etc, BUT it was a standby ticket. Which we DID NOT KNOW PRIOR TO BOOKING. 

I demand  your respective head of department will give us our FULL REFUND BACK. First of all, you did not notify us of the overbooking and putting us on standby, wasting our precious time when we could have booked with another respective airline/mode of transportation to our next destination.

The worst part of travelling with Iberia is the constant lying by their staff - every employee you speak to has a different lie to tell you (for one flight we told successively that we had checked in but chosen not to board, we had cancelled our booking ourselves, and that the flight had been cancelled for mechanical reasons none of which are true).

So, we booked an earlier flight for ourselves. On the day of departure we visited the Iberia desk in Palma airport to make sure that they would not cancel our return leg. They told us a note had been made on ""the computer"". When the day of departure dawned we found that we could not check in on-line; we phoned the airline to be told that our return leg had been cancelled as we did not turn up to take the outgoing leg. The only alternative was to re-book on the same flight at a vastly extortionate price. Instead, we chose to drive to Granada and fly back from there at a fraction of the cost.

Poor service in long European flights,Madrid,Stockholm,Europe,"We had Iberia operating our flights  in  our trip from New York to Stockholm. Surprisingly,  boarding was very orderly. People lined up as usual,  so there were long lines even before boarding. However, Iberia followed the group boarding codes, so it was an empty queue where one personnel was just letting the correct group to board first. We also have experience with group boarding in other airlines but they usually don't follow strictly the boarding order. Now comes our disappointment. The last leg (in Europe), was around 4 hours from Madrid to Stockholm. No food was served for free and not even plain water was offered. We were cramped in seats with very little legroom and that, coming from me who is only 5,2 feet tall. We had body aches coming home since we dared not fall our seats back so that the people  behind can have some space. It was quite different though, when we had Iberia operated flight  in the long haul, i.e. from JFK to Madrid. There, it was very good service, friendly stewardesses, 2 free meals, and free drinks. Also, better leg room. In summary, Iberia should consider that even if it 's a European trip where the shortest is less than an hour, thus doesn't need any food/drink; , a 4-hr European trip is quite long.

Poor Experience Part 2,Casablanca,Madrid,International,"This is a follow-on to my first experience (Part 1) with this airline. 

When I departed Agadir, Morocco I was given a choice to check my bag all the way through to my final destination. I was told at the ticket counter that I would need to pick up a boarding pass to the second leg of my journey when I arrived in Casablanca. Since I had 5.5 hours between flights, I foolishly thought ""no problem"". 

When I arrived in Casablanca I was directed to a holding area in the lower levels of the airport because I did not have the boarding pass. I was told to wait at the Iberia ticket counter and someone would be down to issue the pass. There were 3 other airlines represented and staffed in the area so I thought it would not be long until a representative from Iberia showed - I was VERY WRONG!

My international flight was to depart at 12:30 local. Boarding was to start at 11:50. I waited hour, after hour and not a single person showed at the counter. There were no phones and none of the other airline personnel lifted a finger to help. Needless to say, I was quite concerned after 4 hours passed and I had no pass. Finally, at around 11:10 a rep came and issued the boarding pass. 

Bottom-line. If you are flying from Agadir through Casablanca and connecting to another airline then make sure DO NOT book your baggage all the way through to your final destination. Exit, get your checked bag and go through security. Of course, you will need to allow enough time but at least you won't be stuck in boarding pass purgatory.",April 2018,"April 13, 2018",1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0
Poor Experience Part 1,Madrid,Casablanca,International,"I'd like to start by saying that I am a pretty forgiving person and do not write bad reviews unless they are warranted. 

If you are taking a connecting flight from Madrid (or other location I suspect) to Casablanca ensure you have at least a 2-3 hour layover between flights. The reason for this is because you likely will NOT get your bags on the flight to Casablanca. I had a little over an hour to get to my connecting flight, and while I made it fine, the bags did not. 

To add insult to injury, when I arrived in Casablanca there were no other flights that day to transport my bags so I was stuck. We spent the better part of an hour in-line at the very understaffed service counter in Casablanca. I needed to travel 45 min into the city to my hotel and then another 1.5 hours round trip to the airport and then back into the city the next day. Needless to say, my ability to see the city was shot.

Service without a smile,San Jose,London,International,"Before we left San Jose in Costa Rica we were told by the pilot that the wind around the airport made it dangerous to take off with a full complement of fuel.

Previously we had noticed from the Departure gate that very heavy pallets of freight were being loaded on the plane - it took six men to push the pallets onto the hoist.
The flight left over an hour late and the refuel took 50 minutes. Therefore we arrived at Madrid well over two hours late at 12.43, however, we had been given boarding cards for the onward Heathrow flight IB3176 scheduled to leave from Gate H with the gate closing at 13.20.

Excellent!,Boston,Barcelona,International,"We were getting on a cruise ship in Barcelona and the cruise line offered “free” business class air.

The layout is inconvinient. To the person that has the table on the window side, the seat is at such angle and so far from the window that the elbow of the passenger is right on the isle, every person that walks by is so close to you, it is uncomfortable. The seats are very narrow. Foot rest does not come up, you put your feet on a foot rest that is attached to the seat in front of you. PRO: for this rout, it is the best way to travel direct without any connections. CON terrible seats and layout.

They managed to mess up my vegetarian meal and the food was inedible, and with only two bathrooms in working order for more than 200 passengers resulted in the floors being awash in urine. The flight attendants were completely slammed and thus not able to give any care or attention to the passengers.

Thankfully we were mostly placed all together (4 and 2 one direction; 3, 2 and 1 in another and the 1 could have switched with another passenger but opted not to). Food and beverages provided by airlines was great (they still provide food on 11 hour flights thankfully). In seat entertainment was excellent, lots of choices.

Seats are assigned-nor do you get what you paid extra for,Orlando,Madrid,International,"We booked a group of us on Iberia only to find out seats are not assigned, and you have to pay extra to select one.  We paid a premium for exit row seats, received a confirmation, had it on our boarding pass only to have an issue when boarding where they had assigned my husbands seat to someone else and reassigned him 20 rows away from me in the middle section.  No apology, no attempt to correct, only the flight is full and there is nothing they can do about it.  Was told to contact Iberia about a refund, which is not the point.  The point is we had planned this anniversary trip for over a year, he is 6.5' tall, and we wanted the exit row and wanted to sit together for the 9 hour flight.   While one of us had the exit row, another passenger decided to leave his seat in the back and sit in the flight attendant seat in front of me for the entire flight, encroaching into the legroom I paid extra for.  The flight attendant's had no issue with this and even served his food tray in their jump seat.  To top it off, when we arrived in Madrid, our luggage did not.

There was no soap and the stink was unbelievable.  So an attendant handed him a container of soap to put in there.  Also, we were seated right behind business class, but needed to use the economy class restrooms, which were halfway to the back of the plane.  The aisles were very narrow and difficult to navigate.  It smelled as if the bathrooms were soaked in old urine and never cleaned.  Also, in the middle of the flight, our cabin crew was absent for at least 2 hours.  I used the call button to request some water for me and my family because we were parched.  After 20 minutes, I turned the call button off.  The staff were surly and unpleasant.  One spilled juice all over my daughter's feet and was told by the other attendant that she didn't have to apologize.  Yes, my daughter speaks Spanish!!

Very nice flight and service. Horrible airport (Barcelona).,Barcelona,Los Angeles,International,"Flew Iberia for the first time. Quite impressed. Friendly and on-time service. Meals on the first leg (LAX to Madrid) were decent and included in economy. Booked Iberia back from Barcelona to LAX but apparently it was on their budget long haul (Level Airlines). Didn't mention that anywhere when booking the flight on Iberia. Anyway, it was also a nice flight though we upgraded to premium economy. Meals are not included in regular economy with Level. Overall both flight were very nice, but IMO Barcelona has got to be the worst major airport I have ever been in. Poorly signed. Rude staff. Dirty dining areas. And as mentioned by others, for some bizarre reason you need to line up for security, and then line up again for a ""passport check,"" which took twice as long as security. Luckily we got there early but there were quite a few passengers freaking out about missing their flight because of this unexpected and slow line. Then a bizarre boarding procedure where (mind you with no announcement or warning), we get to the end of the jetway while boarding, only for it to deposit us onto a bus, which took us on a ride literally to the other side of the airport, where we then got out and boarded the plane from the tarmac.

Buyer beware of this national airline,Miami,Madrid,International,"You have to pay to reserve your seats.  There was no room in your seat if the person in front of you reclines.

They served you a 6 ounce can of beer, wine, or soda with your meal.  There were no other alcoholic drink options on both flights nor additional beer or wine offered after the meal.  We paid to reserve our seats for our journey home.  The flying experience as well as the service was much better on the return flight.  The flight on the way to Spain was a D-.  The dinner was delicious which is why I do not give them an F.  The flight home was a solid B.  I would of given them an A if they had served alcohol when requested.  Iberia does not give you cabin service like your typical airlines such as United, American, and Delta.  Having the option to be served beverages throughout the flight is very important to me especially when you are on an 8 plus hour flight.  Usually the national airline of the country you are flying to is the best in service.  In this case, I felt that Iberia was the budget of all budget airlines.  The sad thing was I could of flown with British Airways, Delta, and several other notable airlines for the same price, but chose Iberia thinking that they would offer much better service than everyone else.

I Would Rather Fly Malyasia Airlines,Los Angeles,Milan,International,"Dear Iberia Airlines,

Today was not all lollipops and butterflies.  My experience with your airline made me want to fly Malaysia air and have a 30% chance of not making it to my destination.  Your customer service should be included as one of Dante's nine levels of hell probably sandwiched between fraud and treachery.  

Laura, was one of the most frustrating people I have ever had the displeasure to come in contact with.  Between the language barrier and running in circles she was unable to grasp the basics of customer service.  She quoted us multiple prices ranging from $230 to $2,750 for a change fee which wouldn't include the price of the ticket.  When asking to speak with a manager she curtly replied they would say the same thing she did. 

After reading other reviews on Yelp and Trip Advisor and getting a better idea of the mind numbing incompetence of Iberia airlines I would strongly encourage any other means of transportation i.e. walking, swimming, jet skies, boat, train, scooter, horse, or even the dreaded Spirit or Ryan Airlines.

Smelly feet next to your head,Chicago,Madrid,International,"The flight was uneventful just like the crew and food. I knew I was going on a budget airline from the start so my expectations was low. The only reason i took this flight because it was the only non stop flight to Madrid from Ord. 

My family of 4 sat in business class and my 5 years old spilled his drink on his table cloth and the flight attendant just gave me an “opps” look. She made no attempt to help him out or change the table cloth. You might ask why I as his mother did not help him out? Well he was sitting in the middle 2 seat with his 8 years old brother and I was across from his aisle. With food on my table it takes some time to get up and go over.

The seat was very narrow. I am 115lbs and 5 feet 2 so I am pretty small. I have to sleep with my hands on my belly  or else it will hang to the side of the seat.

Unfortunatelly, we were classified as ""missed connection passengers"", so they closed the flight and didn't allow us to board. After 30 (at least) our only option was to fly to Paris and arrive to Marrakech 30h after the planned sechedule. 
Staff, what to say, they just don't care (27/03, 11:25)! The only explanation I got was that passengers prefer to have their flight on time, so they just don't wait for connecting flights (as I told you, we got to the door 15m before from an Iberia connecting flight!)

Find another Carrier Buyer Beware,Lisbon,Madrid,Europe,Horrendous Airline. Read other reviews don't just take my word. Customer Service is nonexistent. You have NO RIGHTS with this airline and any delay or cancelled flight you will be forced to forfeit any funds paid and you will be stranded or forced to find another Airline at top price last minute to arrive at your destination. Their flight history is horrendous. They claim to be the most on time - DONT believe it.  You will be treated horribly whenever trying to speak in person or by phone or written correspondence. They force you to check in your hand carry luggage due to always overfilling their flights to drive revenues. Then they will damage or loose your luggage. That is even if the rare chance the flight was on time as scheduled. The blame weather impacts whereas other airlines have no impact at all for the same flight. They have issues with their own pilots and flight crews showing up which results in being stranded in strange countries and delayed for day. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.

Iberia Never Again,Brussels,Oviedo,Europe,"I booked a business class return ticket for my 70 year old mother who has just been diagnosed with cancer. The trip is to take her back to see her home village where she hasn’t been in 30 years and knowing that this may well be the last chance to go. 

When doing the booking I used the name she has always used which is her married name. Unfortunately the passport has her maiden name. When I realized this problem I called Iberia customer service to try and fix it. They confirmed that she would be denied boarding. 

They refused to change the name even though there was still ample time before the flight. The rep’s only suggestion was to cancel the ticket (for 180€ fees) and buy a new one (now significantly more expensive). When I said this was quite outrageous especially considering I had already paid for business class, the sales rep became condescending and asked me “who did the mistake? You or us?”.  I asked to speak to his supervisor only to get yelled at and hanged up on. 

What kind of airline does this? 

I won’t be caught dead in an Iberia plane ever again.

It was getting better but since it was taken over by BA.......,Madrid,Miami,International,"Iberia.

Business Class Madrid to Miami 14th November  and Miami to Madrid 4th December 2017.

  Seating and leg room excellent. Punctual as well.
 I have flown Iberia for over 35 years and watched it´s transition from a badly run state airline to one of the most modern, efficient and enjoyable in the world. Sadly with British Airways Willie Walsh now in overall charge it is in decline with a policy of maximum profit for their shareholders at the expense of the paying passenger. The service now offered is more akin to a cut price airline than a full fare business class ticket. Gone are the fantastic menus by some of Spain´s most famous Chef´s and the meal now offered is more in line with the standard fair offered on BA - which is hardly a culinary delight.Little wonder all the sea bass was  taken by the time the purser arrived at my seat, and the choice left was pigs cheek or pasta. Good job I had a decent breakfast in the Iberia lounge before boarding! Their bodega of fine wines is no longer their boast, instead there is a mention in the meal menu that they have red and white wines and spirits. The menu states a wine list, but there was none.
 
Iberia´s introduction of their new Premium Economy class has unfortunately been to the detriment of it´s business class. One of the aft business toilets has been removed to create more room, bringing the number down to two very busy toilets which showed signs of heavy use half way through the flight. The rear toilet might be the better choice of the two to use. Gone is the orderly area aft where sandwiches and drinks were on a self service basis throughout the flight. The sandwiches are gone too and the choice on my flight was down to nuts or fruit in a plastic cup or chocolates. This service now shares the forward galley, which at times  is more like the strewn back room of a soup kitchen, with it being difficult to distinguish what is for the galley and what is self service for the passengers. However, after the meal the cabin crew did bring it to a good resemblance of order. There is simply not enough room for both. The only alternative to Miami is AA and it is not an alternative that I would look at lightly, but  more of choosing the lesser of the two evils, and one I will have to consider in the future. 

The return leg to Madrid faired much better. They must have fixed the menu as in the back of the December menu it  included three fine red wines and two excellent whites. I have a weakness for Cava and it too was excellent. This time I managed to order the sea bass with lemon parsley sauce, mashed sweet potato, red beet and green asparagus and it was excellently presented, but including a beef hamburger in the menu was rather unimaginative - unless Iberia are trying to lure American travelers with fast food!  I finished my meal with a 12 year old Flor de Cana rum on the rocks. Excellent. On this flight the aft business section had not been changed into Premium Economy and there were adequate toilets. The snacks were in their usual place and this time there were sandwiches as well as Belgian chocolates. Maybe I will have to reconsider AA as an alternative to Iberia. Better the devil you know.......

The Iberia Plus points system has also been changed and not for the better. It used to be that if you accrued some 120,000 points that was enough to have a free round business trip ticket to the USA from Madrid. Now you need some 180,000 points, and that will only get you a half price fare.",November 2017,"March 18, 2018",4.0,,,,,,,,

Is that normal for Iberia? Because that's just not how things run in the world of hospitality and services.  I opted for a lactose free meal and for some reason that translated into no salt, bland, under cooked rubbery meals every time.  Whenever I asked for a regular meal they made the biggest fuss about letting me have a left over meal.  I couldn't understand why they were so rude. Those terrible meals are not what I requested.  I paid over $850 for this flight and they were beyond terrible.  I sent their senior management an email regarding the complaint and overall terrible treatment to myself and the rest of the people I traveled with and have not received a response nor do I expect to.

TERRIBLE SERVICE,Boston,Madrid,International,"We flew from Washington DC to Boston on 2:30 PM flight on 3/7/18  with American Airlines. We had a layover and second flight to Madrid with another airline, Iberia. 

Once we were in Boston, the Iberia staff told that the flight had been cancelled in morning because the plane never even showed up, again our first flight was not until 2:30 PM, and that we should have been notified. However, we did not receive any notice. Obviously, if we had received timely notice, we would never have gone to Boston in the first place, as there was no point in traveling to Boston if the flight had been cancelled.  Especially after we were told that we could not get on the flight the next day either, and that no other alternative was offered. 

The staff at the airline counter were not helpful and lied to us. They sent us to other airline stating that we had been rebooked with British Airways else when was not the case. In fact, when my husband went to speak with British Airways, they said that not only had we not been booked with them, they had a flight cancelled as well, and that they gave priority to their customers. They also said that, when they have issues, they do not send their customers to Iberia or other airlines, but try to help them. 

We also had a nightmare of a time getting our luggage. We went to the Iberia Luggage counter, and they said that since they didn't have a flight that day, they couldn't not have had their luggage.  The Iberia employee said all of this without taking the time to check if they had our luggage. Moreover, they told us that American Airlines definitely had our luggage, and if they gave us any issues, we should speak with a American Airlines manager. We then went to a different terminal to see if American did, indeed, have our luggage, and they checked, and they did not. They called Iberia, and the found out that Iberia had our luggage the whole time. Then, the American employee was nice enough to go and get our luggage, although it was soaking wet when he got back about 2 hours later. 

We are very upset with the service to mention an endless amount of aggravation and deceit,  because the airline did not do their job. The person at the counter told us that flight was apparently cancelled that morning and only at 4pm the same day we had to go all the way to Boston to be told we were not having a trip to Madrid.",March 2018,"March 13, 2018",1.0,,,,1.0,,,,

They could not even tell us when the plane would actually get to Shanghai, let alone when we would be able to board. All they offered was a hotel voucher for the night in Shanghai and told us to return in 24 hours in the hopes the plane would be ready. It wasn't. We waited another several hours on the next day for the plane to arrive. After several complaints to the airline, all I got as response was the following: ""Dear XXX, I am writing in relation to flight IB 6888 on 10th February 2018 and would like to take this opportunity to thank you for contacting us.Please accept my apologies for the inconvenience we might have caused you due to the flight delay.

We were served a glass of bubbles prior to our departure ,dinner and breakfast. The Dinner was nice and accompanied by drinkable wines.The dessert wines were particularly enjoyable. All meals were served on white tray cloths and proper cutlery. If travelling such a long flight I would strongly recommend going business class. The only minor blip was both our suitcases were slightly damaged when we got to Madrid.

When you get to Madrid, it is a different world. You must wait until all passengers are out... Then you are guided to a special transportation where they move you to where chairs are located. There, helpers are waiting for your arrival. If you have a connecting flight, they rapidly take you there... they know you mus continue your flight to another city and are waiting for you. Should you need a taxi, they promptly move you to TAXI AREA. ""Pusher"" are always efficient and helpful... usually in a very good mood. You really feel you are being welcomed to Spain.

Unnecessary hassle coupled with terrible customer service and poor aircraft service,Santiago,Toulouse,International,"I booked a one way flight at short notice by telephone directly with Iberia in Chile and paid by credit card with allocated seats.

I am still awaiting any paperwork to show how much was paid for the ticket after 3 times calling Customer Service and being promised it would be emailed. 
Receiving a booking confirmation with price paid is standard airline practice. Ryanair achieve this within 30 seconds. 
Making a Customer complaint on the Iberia website to get this basic paperwork requires me to email a copy of my passport before they will help, putting me at risk of identity theft. 
I had to check-in at a desk at the airport as online would not work (credit card check needed). The seats I received were in the centre section not the window / aisle seats that were allocated.
The service and quality of food on the aircraft was basic for an international flight with service also curtailed but not resumed because of some turbulence. This was very poor compared to the quality of food and service received on the prior LATAM domestic flight (IPC-SCL).

I'll confess to being spoiled by a very rare opportunity to fly Emirates business class recently, which puts other carriers to shame.

This was followed by a very turbulent flight. It would have been more tolerable if the attitude of some of the cabin staff had not been unhelpful, surly and quite rude at times.
The food was terrible.  Cups of tea were only served half full for 'health and safety' reasons.  Coffee is obviously much safer to drink and not bound by 'health and safety' rules as coffee cups were served almost full. This partly demonstrates the attitude of some of the cabin staff.
Entertainment was good, plenty of films to watch.
Arrived in Madrid too late to catch connecting flight to Heathrow.  Iberia ground staff did not seem to  know what to do with 100+ passengers anxious for details of new flights.

Not impressed,Madrid,Tokyo,International,"The trip from Madrid to Tokyo is fourteen hours ! So, as am six foot two with very long legs, I paid an additional charge for a seat with extra legroom. It was only when I boarded the airbus 330 that I discovered that I had been allocated a totally different seat to the one I paid extra for. The cabin crew told me that as the flight was full there was no possibility to give me another seat. They had given me a seat with the smallest amount of legroom and insisted that I had chosen that seat. Wtf ! Why would somebody as tall as I am pay extra for the smallest seat in the house ? I have since heard that the row of seats I had chosen, facing a bulkhead with lots of legroom, are in fact often given to children. I guess they just thought putting me somewhere close was good enough. Once airborne the purser came and offered me the only other seat available, a window seat, still with very restricted legroom. So I spent fourteen bloody hours having to continually disturb the lady next to me to go walkabout to get some circulation back into my legs. She was not happy I can tell you. She demanded to know why I hadn’t booked a seat with extra legroom. I had, and I bloody well paid extra for it. The cabin crew were ok, friendly and efficient, sympathetic even. However the hot meal was stone cold. When I complained about it the stewardess simply said she would pass the message on. Nothing was done about it. Quite frankly I’d rather travel with Ryanair and that is saying something.

We had a small carryon bag which meet the size measurements but the lady at the gate insisted most of us Priority’s boaring had to ship our bags no matter what size for the reason no room on over head compartments then later on we saw there were plenty of room and people boarded after priority groups can carry their carryons on board. We didn’t see anybody taking our bag so we brought it on board with us because we didn’t want to lose it since no one at the gate to give it to

It was DISGUSTING!!!! The two choices we had were lasagna or a hamburger patty with rice. The lasagna looked more like mush potatoes than anything else and the hamburger super greasy. The bread (as always) was cold and hard as a rock. BTW..stay away from their coffee and tea. You would be never know from where they get the water...
One more thing..If you are a member of One World, Iberia will not let you use the miles that you earned flying other airlines within the same consortium except if you earned them by flying in British Airways. So much for their ""alliance""

Avoid IBERIA by all means!,Mexico City,Berlin,International,"The ticket was relatively cheap but since it was a trip of about 3 months, the reason why I bought it, was the possibility to change the return flight for EUR 100,- 
This was stated during purchase and confirmed in the ticket. Great! I thought. But when I actually wanted to set the correct date of my return flight through the link provided in the e-ticket, the first deception was that I was informed that I had to call a German call center in order to set the date. From Mexico...! After calling Iberia Mexico they confirmed that only the German or Spanish call centers can do so. So far not a real drama. But this was just the beginning... 
The process was relatively smooth, date set, the difference in flight fare was ony EUR 14,95 more (I flew back earlier than the date I had originally chosen) so I thought I'm done with EUR 114,95 (+ the calls to their outsourced callcenters in Europe). But NOPE! At this point the drama began... 
The callcenter insisted that the change cost EUR 180,- plus a service fee for their telephone service. WHUT? But I had it in writing in my ticket... They service center ""informed"" me that this, what was stated in writing in my ticket, was not correct and that I had to pay EUR 224,95 instead of EUR 100,-
I wrote to their customer service email address (see image) and asked for clarification but only received an automated message that in order to solve my problem I had to call the call centers. So I had to call this call center that was exactly causing the problem, in order to solve the problem. 
Alright I thought, this calls for an approach through their Facebook page. 
What followed was ONE MONTH of post exchange  in which the IBERIA facebook teams promised to get it right with the callcenters but eventually never succeeded. As the date of my intended return approached I was forced to purchase the ticket, and believe it or not, they charged me EUR 224,95 instead of the agreed EUR 114,95.
After my return and with proper access to phone and email I started to get them on board for a refund but they claimed not to be able to do anything and even dared to tell me ""I should not have paid the EUR 224,95 if the EUR 100,- was agreed in writing. I was SPEECHLESS!!!
Enough talked, I raised this to the local court and guess what, the next working day I received a received an announcement over a refund of the fraudulently charged EUR 80,-
When checking back with IBERIA when they would refund the EUR 30,- ""Service fee"" they charged for this fraud, they claimed that this would be the charge I had to pay for ""the services"" the call center has given me. The fact that I wanted to use the online link but they did revert me to the callcenter they ignored with a simple ""as you could see, the online option was not avaiable""...
Summary:
If you are lucky and your flight goes through as planned you may be able to buy a cheap ticket with a cheap airline, but as soon as you need to interact with IBERIA about anything (changes, lost luggage, etc.) THEY WILL SCREW YOU.

"Fair Flight, But Poor Service",Oviedo,Orlando,International,"This was a flight with multiple connections. The actual itinerary was OVD-MAD-MIA-MCO  and return MCO-MIA-MAD-OVD. As a warning, in these routes you need to give yourself at least 2 1/2 hours connecting time in the international connections (e.g. MAD-MIA) as MIA passport control and customs are very slow and inefficient. As far as the airline is concerned, IBERIA's service personnel (ground agents, flight attendants, etc.) are just plain poor; although I must say better than the last time we traveled with them. The in-flight food service was just awful. As always, their Economy ""cuisine"" was an option of chicken or pasta. I had the chicken and my wife ordered the pasta. The chicken was in this case poorly cooked (Vs. the last time which was over-cooked/ burnt). The pasta was, as per my wife, hard. I had to ask the flight attendants several times for extra water, as our requests kept being unfulfilled. After lunch (on the way to the U.S.) and dinner (on the return flight), over the course of the flight, the flight attendants never came back to see/ask if we needed anything else or wanted anything else to drink. The breakfast, on the return flight, was just as bad as the dinner; cold, small portions, and unsavory. Overall, we are unsatisfied with IBERIA quality of service. BTW, throughout the various flights the airline (through the PA system) kept over and over espousing the fact that IBERIA was declared for 2017 as the ""Most On Time"" airline in the world. While that is nice and welcomed, we never heard anything about (or where the airline ranks) on other Key Performance Indicators that are also an important measure of an airline's value to the traveling public (e.g. Customer Satisfaction, Price/Value (or Value for your Money), Equipment Reliability, Aircraft Cleanliness Record, etc.).",November 2017,"February 21, 2018",2.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,1.0

"In a sea of airlines, next time you fly to or from Europe, consider flying Iberia",Marrakech,Miami,International,"Iberia has not always had the best reputation, although they have a long history, they have had their ups and downs. Non-the less, this time it seamed like a good idea to fly with them. 

Now let’s talk about the on board service; the flight was on time, Iberia claims it is the “Worlds number 1 on time airline”. I was relieved to see that the aircraft was an updated one and it had an entertainment system that offered somewhat of a decent selection of movies and shows, (even though some shows like “the Handmaid tale”, only offered 1 episode from an entire season), none the less, there was enough to keep me entertained in the 10 + hour flight to Miami.

During our flight we had 2 services, a lunch that was average and your basic airline food, nothing to rave about and about 1hour ½ before landing we were offered a box with a yogurt, a candy bar and a pastry, also very average. I wish there had been service in between, but other than a flight attendant walking thru the aisle offering water once and coffee another time, that was the extent of service, I believe that for a long-haul flight, this is less than adequate, there should be at least 2 drink and snack services in between meal services, especially for a transatlantic flight.

Over all, I found Iberia to be an average airline that offers a service that like many other airlines has lost its touch with its consumer. In an era where consumers demand more, I am surprised how airlines have managed to take away more and more and still make unbelievable profits all while having the worst consumer satisfaction.

Also, why is it that with economy passengers being the bulk of the airlines business, get the worst service of all? Don’t get me wrong, I don’t expect white glove service in economy, but I do expect to be treated with respect and dignity, they are paying passengers after all. Why treat them as the cattle of the transportation industry?

If airlines improved their service, even just a little, it would create positive ripples around the world, maybe passengers would enjoy flying again and instead of being angry, frustrated and on edge, causing many of todays issues, like in flight fights and or problems causing delays, plane turn arounds, people being kicked off flights, maybe we would all enjoy flying again ….",January 2018,"February 17, 2018",3.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,3.0
Poor service,Madrid,Buenos Aires,International,"I appreciate that your main concern with flying is safety and punctuality and on both counts I have no complaints, but when travelling long haul on a flight of thirteen and a half hours you expect a certain standard of service. 
Only one meal was provided as I don’t accept that a cold roll with a bit of cheese and ham can be regarded as a meal. In between these the cabin crew rarely offered anything else. Yes, you could walk up to the galley and help yourself to some water but what were the crew doing for the majority of the flight?  As this was a daytime flight you would expect them to be a little more attentive even if was to break up the boredom.

No hand luggage allowed - poor customer service,La Coruna,Madrid,Domestic,"I don't usually write to complain but the Iberia boarding process leaves a lot to be desired and needs to be highlighted. For the second time in a week, the ground crew attempted to remove my hand luggage while I was on the air bridge metres away from the plane. without prior warning. 

I was boarding with my mother (76) and two others. We were among the first to board after priority passengers and those with children, or in need of assistance. I estimate that perhaps 40 people had boarded before we reached the door of the plane. I was approached by a member of the ground crew who attempted to relieve me of my luggage claiming that there was no more room in the overhead lockers. 

I declined to hand over my luggage and explained we had a two-hour turnaround in Madrid where we had to transfer from Terminal 4 to Terminal 1 and navigate through security. I also said I was prepared to stow the luggage at my feet if necessary but was told that was not possible, even though I had kept it there on my inward flight.

I was not being awkward for the sake of it and if I was advised while still in the departure lounge, that it may be necessary, I would have obliged if we didn't have such a tight connection. I was in no way alone in being unhappy with the way we were being treated and asked why Iberia does not act in the same courteous and professional way the likes of easyJet and KLM do. I am sure more people would have handed over their luggage if they were given the choice in advance.

As I had refused to hand over my luggage and attempted to board the plane the ground crew decided to call the police to have me removed from the flight. I waited at the door of the plane with my luggage while the remaining passengers went through the timely process of having their hand luggage removed and labelled for stowing in the hold. Once all passengers had boarded I asked if the police were coming and was told they were not and I could board with my luggage. 

When I found my seat and opened the overhead locker, I found enough space for three or four pieces of luggage. The rest of the lockers were the same, less than half full. I appreciate that sometimes it is necessary to stow hand luggage in the hold, but on this occasion it appeared to be unnecessary.

Average flight; poor boarding practice,Madrid,Barcelona,Domestic,"My colleague and I took the Madrid to Barcelona flight from Iberia in February of this year. This route is so frequent that they have flights at least hourly. Iberia are part of the IAG group and I see parts of the behaviour within the airline that mirrors that of the rest of that group service.

After being instructed to start boarding at 10:20 for our 11:00 flight we made our way to the gate at 10:10. The gate was starting to fill with people; however, it was not immediately clear where to wait. There were approximately 7 staff members - both flight attendants and boarding staff waiting by the desk having a conversation and generally ignoring all customers. Once the doors opened to let the crew through, the remaining member of staff began checking their mobile phone. After another boarding staff member arrived they took 15 more minutes to decide what to do. After announcing the boarding the plan to board business / first class etc passenges fell apart when people just started going up and asking to board when they wanted. The result was that eventually people ignored the boarding process. On board this meant that it took longer to board the plane.

Customer Service & Passenger care useless - Constant flight changes,Zurich,Malaga,Europe,"I had booked the flight to Malaga about 8 months before the flight date. The flight to and from Malaga were direct flight, I hate 1 stop flights as I had an extremely bad experience a few years ago.

The changed the departure flight time twice but the time was not too bad, it was a 30 minute change on the outward bound time and the return was to be at 18.45 which was good for me as it gave me a bit extra time in Malaga. I was not all together unhappy initially. I was to fly out on Friday and back on Wednesday. 

A few months later they changed it again and automatically re booked me on a return flight on the Friday. I was really angry as they never contacted me (called me). Juts sent me an email which meant I had to call them. What the hell were they thinking. I have to work and moving my flight to the Friday, no call just an email with the following 2We are contacting you to inform you of a change in your flight. ""We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause. Here are the details:""

I then had to call them. The number inn the email was a Spanish one. I know that but other people might not. If you looked there was also a Swiss number (+41) 848 000 015 but this is not free. I am even angry writing this.

I changed the flight but I had to accept a flight with Vueling flying via Madrid. A really useless airline that treats customers with complete and utter disrespect.

The arrogance. I was to fly on Monday and they decide that they will re book me on Thursday at 7.00.

This is not the first time Iberia have done this. Recently I had my flight to Malaga changed 3 times and the backward leg was no longer a direct flight but a 2 stop flight. I will write about this in another review.

Embarizing for me as a Spaniard,Madrid,Panama City,International,"I had not flown with Iberia for years and was extremely embarrassed to see how my country´s national airline had lowered their standards to such appalling service. The seats and leg space was minute; very low food standards (Spain is a country with excellent food) and the worst part....the crew. On the way to Panama the crew was, at least, well mannared. They serve what they call breakfast in a box and even have the nerve to ask the passangers to put everything in the box, when finished, so that they can collect it faster. On the return flight, the crew were loud, rud and had no respect whatsoever for the passangers. We were sitting at the back of the plane, just in front of the kitchen at the tail of the plane. The crew spent the whole flight (night flight) chatting at the top of their voices, without any concern about the passangers that were trying to sleep just in front of them. The airhost on our side of the plane came down the aisle shouting: Te, ta, to, tu!!! when offering tea; answered us as if he was our longtime friend, with no respect whatsoever. It was really embarrassing to see how the crew treated the passangers. 
I know nowadays we all want cheap flights but we do not set the plane rates, the companies do and if they charge whatever they decide to charge,  the least that can be expected from any airline is a minimum standard of service and to be treated with respect and education from the crew who, at the end of the day, are there to make your flight more comfortable and ejoyable, not to take the Mickey out of you.
Having flown with many different airlines in my life, sadly, I have to say Iberia is the worst of all. They were not up to other standards in the past but to date, they are way bellow any other company and I will definitely not fly with them again if I can avoid it and, as I said at the beginning, it is really sad and embarrassing for me to have to say this about my own country´s national airline.",March 2017,"February 9, 2018",2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0
Worst travel of my life,Tel Aviv,Las Palmas de Gran Canaria,International,"I took of from tel aviv airport on. Wed 7.2.17 to las lalmas at the grand canary island. The fight took off at 6 o'clock. I was supposed to land at 12pm that day. At about 7am they gave us breakfat but after 5 minutes the captain said we have to land emergency landing at Athens airport due to mal function in one engine, so they took the breakfast back and people did notget the chance to eat anything.  We landed and waited for 45 minutes in the plain. Then we had to go down. Pass via security which checked us as if we just came from the outside and were possible terrorist. We had to take our luggeges and start check in all over again only because the travel agent found us alternative flight to Milano with alitalia. Before that they gave us 10 euros cupons for breakfast in a place which had low choice of food and far from being resonable to eat. We waited for almost 3 hours in the airport. Then about 2 hours to madrid with alitalia. No food possible as we joined on the last minute. Another witing in Milano and then 2 hours fligh and again to Las Palmas. A 24 hours trip instead of 6 or 8. We got NO FOOD on both flights from Milano and from Madrid. Only to buy. No compensation for more than 12 hours. This was a nightmare and one if the worst day in my life. Never take Iberia. Not to mention they asked us at the tlv airport to put our carry on, on wheels, bags with the luggage because there was no place to put it in the plane.

First trip on Iberia,Madrid,Tel Aviv,International,"Having flown from Malaga to Madrid with Iberia I then took an Iberia flight from Madrid to Tel Aviv in order to transit through tel Aviv and get a flight home to Paphos Cyprus.  I have to say that for an economy flight the trip wasn’t too bad.  The seats were spacious enough and the plane looked relatively new.  The staff could not have been more helpful and even though food was pretty good considering I was travelling economy!  I would probably look at using Iberia again however if it was long haul would pay the extra for either premium economy or business.  The only negative with the flight was the temperature!  It was freezing and despite several customers mentioning it the temperature couldn’t be fixed.

Be warned, transiting through Tel Aviv is not straight forward!!  You have to leave the airport and go back in, DO NOT FOLLOW TRANSIT SIGNS!  I did and ended up being questioned by 6 members of airport security for over an hour!  Because it is not common for people to transit through they are incredibly suspicious!!

As an avid traveller whose flown with most airlines please AVOID Iberia Airline at all cost...

I booked the flights through British Airway but they only flew the first part of the journey which was great friendly service, however for the second part of the journey and the longest it was Iberia Airline which was anything but, this flight was chaotic, there was no welcome, the staff senior in age (not that I’m being agist at all), they were slow rude, unhelpful and beyond arrogant...

I bought our ticket way in advance gave our dietary requirements and booked the seats of our choice to which none where respected or honoured...

The plane was dirty, pillows had stains on them and very uncomfortable seats also what didn’t help was having a very large man sit next to us, he took over half of our seat which we pointed out to the cabin crew but they didn’t care or offer any solutions...

There were no in-flight messages or info on when food or drink would be served, we were in the air for ages then they finally came around with papers, then food which was beyond disgusting plus I had mine 40 minutes before my family member so we didn’t eat the same time.  I requested a vegan option which in this day and age you’d expect something more than plain boiled rice and a few wilted vegetables, it was inedible.  Then they came around with a very limited drinks selection and bland hot drinks.  If the selection and blandness of the food & drinks weren’t bad enough there’s simply no words to express how awful the customer service was, the female flight attendants were so unfriendly and unhelpful, I’ve NEVER ever experienced such appalling service like this before...  

Hours passed then they came around again and handed or shall I say threw a sandwich at you, my dietary option was NOT available they told me I could either have meat or cheese!!!!! I explained that I don’t eat meat or diary to which they just shrugged their shoulders and told me ‘I could have one of the cabin crews apple as they’re nice like that’!!!  They didn’t even know what a vegan was!!!!!!   Then they came around with the poor drink selection and tasteless hot drinks...

Oh, there was one good thing to take your mind off the appalling food, drink, uncomfortable seats and beyond dreadful customer service and that was the selection of the movies available, thank goodness I had my own earphones as the ones they handed out were uncomfortable in the ears and did not sound great...

Iberia you spoilt the start to our time away, you really did and we will NEVER fly with you again...

Checkin was fine and i was told we would arrive 30 mins early giving me sufficient time to connect to Malaga.
We used the LATAM lounge at GRU  which was very pleasant--clean--good food /wine.
We pushed back on time on the A 330 and lift off was soon after.
Sadly we lost time and arrived 15 mins late into MAD 06.50am and as a result i missed my connection at 07.25am..
Staff were at the gate to issue new boarding cards and i now had a 4.45h delay.for a 12.15pm departure.

Yes --yet again this flight Iberia --AIR NOSTUM--gets delayed and we arrived 55mins late into Malaga.

Why can Iberia not operate on time .

Inflight dinner was acceptable  no French Champagne served instead warm cava.

The whole time she held her hand up and said no. It was extremely rude. Love to support the airline of Spain however this was an extremely bad experience.

Worst airline I have ever flown on,Miami,Madrid,International,"Iberia is by far the worst airline that I have ever flown on. My problems with Iberia started long before the day we flew. I tried to call them for about six weeks before our departure. I dialed the US 800 number, indicated I wanted to speak English and when asked what I wanted, I said representative. I was told a representative would be with me shortly, my call would transfer, and after about two minutes, I got a click and a dial tone. This happened repeatedly.

When I checked in at the Iberia counter in Miami and the agent looked at my return date, he grinned at said, “Do you know what is happening on the 17th?” I said, “the strike and what are you going to do to help me?” He replied, “you can pay to change your ticket.” This is not acceptable and is not customer service.”

We got to the Iberia gate area. Someone had vomited profusely fairly close to the Iberia counter. It was there for at least two hours and no one bothered to clean it up.

Airlines are not known for their food and I understand that. The food served on the flight was disgusting and I could not eat a lot of it. It was the worst airline food I have ever had. The food coming back was not so great but not as bad as the flight to Spain.

The restrooms were also the dirtiest I have ever seen. The fact that passengers are pigs is not the airline’s fault, but they should be serviced in flight. I have taken many international flights and have never seen anything so gross. People urinated on the toilet seat. There was trash and urine all over the floor.

Very Satisfied.,Johannesburg,Madrid,International,"Booked return tickets to Madrid on a promotional deal at excellent rates for flights over Christmas.  Although I had concerns after reading a number of reviews, we were more than satisfied with the service. Efficient flight attendants offered basic service and acceptable meals in both Spanish and English.  In-flight entertainment was ample with an individual touch-screen monitor.  Flight statistics were available on display throughout the flight.  Ground staff in Johannesburg and Madrid was friendly and helpful.

I paid extra to ensure we have two seats in a configuration of 2:4:2 and it was money well spent.  The rows in the middle of the plane on the wing leave more space on the side due to the wider fuselage.  Leg-room was better than expected and the seats were comfortable (for airplane seats that is). I am 184 cm and 120 kg (6 feet & 265 pounds) and this was one of the best long haul flights I have had in economy class.  The seat was slightly narrow for me but by lifting the arm-rests it solved the problem.  Some rows have an additional ""casing"" under the seats and if you sit behind that, it is impossible to straighten your leg past that.  On the return flight I opted for the same set-up but in a different row and had no such problem.  It can also be the fact that outbound was with an A330(200) and we returned with an A330(300). 

This direct flight departed on time and touched down in Madrid ahead of schedule in a few minutes short of 10 hours.  The overall conclusion is that we had a very satisfying experience with Iberia and will most definitely make use of them again when traveling to Spain - OR to use them as a gateway to Europe considering their efficiency and the connecting flights out of Madrid.",December 2017,"January 28, 2018",5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

By using skyscanner as one of my favourite website for finding flights Iberia airlines showed up on top as the cheapest airline to my destination

So, I went to Iberia website and from there I book the return ticket Brussels - Colombia. I book a multicity ticket - Brussels - Bogota - Cartagena- Brussels for a reasonable price. Well, booking 9 months in advance 

Our flight starts early morning from Brussels with a stopover in Madrid. From Madrid we change to another carrier a bigger plane for Bogota

As it is my first time flying a longhaul with Iberia, I'm anxious how it is the passengers legroom. As I had a horrible experience with Alitalia last year during our trip Chile, a cramped seat and onboard entertainment is broken we're all suffering sitting on the flights for 14 hours, I certainly do not flying with that airline again

By my surprised with Iberia Airline - all I can say I certainly fly again with this airline in the future especially the longhaul flights. Economy seats are really comfortable with more legroom. A perfect airline for far destinations. 

Meals onboard - in my opinion, they're all the same, and I don't care about food as I don't eat during flights, the most important that I have enough legroom as I'm suffering with a swelling legs during flight

Just one thing, I find air hostess on Iberia ""should"" more friendly and more English.

Let´s start with the mess they did with my seating:  I bought 8 tickets to go to Geneva on January the 1st and come back to Madrid on January the 7th, since we wanted to go a bit more comfortable we booked emergency exit seats (15€ per seat), the initial plane was an A320 and some weeks before the actual flight they changed the plane to an A321, instead of keeping the emergency seats we paid for, they changed our seats and gave us regular seats. I called Iberia to fix the issue and I had literally several calls where after being told my call would be transferred to someone that would help me Iberia kept me on hold for more than an hour!! While I was on hold with one phone I called with another one and again the same thing happened!! it was beyond frustrating.

After hours of calls and them trying to fix it apparently the system wouldn´t allow to, so my only option was to make a claim to get my emergency seats money back and go on the new seats assigned. One day later they called me to see if I wanted an upgrade for 4 of the 8 tickets I bought to business for 40€ each, I said yes. Then they did 9 charges of upgrade!!! how does that even work if I bought 8 tickets and they were offering me 4 seats?!?

Again, I called to fix the situation and after hour upon hour on hold the only solution was to make a claim to get the money of the 5 extra seats back.... to make the situation even funnier they called me a day later to offer me the seats I had already bought.

When I booked, I made my reservation with my platinum card so all of the tickets had fast track and priority boarding, but after all this issues Iberia messed it up even more and the day of the flight we found out Iberia splitted the reservations and now 6 out of the 8 tickets didn´t have fast track nor priority booking, I tried to explain them when doing the baggage drop at the airport but they were unable to fix it.

The flight itself as it happens with Iberia was uncomfortable with super limited space, the seat in front of me was compressing my knees (I´m a little over 190 cm so tall but not crazy tall). Like always Iberia selling low cost space and service at premium prices... 

On the way, back from Geneva the emergency seats were free!! How is that even possible!! I pay for them, they messed it up and changed my seats, they tell me they can´t give me the emergency seats and that I have to do a claim to get my money back and then I see that the seats are empty, seriously Iberia?!

The business class flight on the way back was mediocre, the only highlight was a decent burger and that’s about it.",January 2018,"January 12, 2018",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0

Never again on Iberia if we can help it................,Johannesburg,Milan,International,"This is a good/bad and ugly story. 
We had to fly Iberia as BA could not accommodate us  on the assigned dates.
Their website to start with is not user friendly and eventually I gave up searching for on-board shopping in order to order on-line. We could not check in on- line in JHB or Milan.

Our aircrafts were all good and new, entertainment was easy to navigate and leg room 
was good. That is the good news.

The food on board was indifferent as was the service.  It would have been nice to see a smile every now and then. The breakfast (so called) was disgusting and cold; not even at room temperature.

The internal broadcasts in English were a blurr... heavy Spanish accents spoken so fast that no one could follow.  To give some credit, we could understand the captains who spoke well and slowly; and the pre-recorded messages.

London to Santiago - second leg,Madrid,Santiago,International,"Flight 6833 Madrid to Santiago, Chile 10th November 2017. When I booked my flight with Expedia they reported that the plane would be an Airbus A340-500 which has 2 engines. I find flying very boring and the only interesting thing is looking out of the window to see the land (or islands) we’re flying over. For that reason I logged on to SeatGuru to check out the seating. SeatGuru (part of the TripAdvisor group) told me Iberia didn’t have any A340-500s and they suggested that the plane might actually be an A340-600 which is a longer plane with 4 engines and a different seating plan. Despite several emails and enquiries to both Expedia and Iberia I was told the plane was definitely A340-500. When I did the online check-in I was shown the seating plan for the smaller plane and chose a seat which would give a clear view of any ground below. The plane turned out to be the larger plane and my seat gave me an excellent view of the top of the wing for the whole of the 11 hour flight. No fun, especially when I’d been looking forward to seeing the Andes mountains from above. Fortunately on the return flight the plane actually was an A340-500 (Ciudad de Mexico), although the safety leaflets in the pockets behind the seats were all for the different, larger, plane which has a vastly different layout and 10 emergency exits whereas the A340-500 has only 8. I suspect Iberia recently acquired the A340-500 but had forgotten to get the A340-500 safety leaflets.

Tenerife to Madrid delayed by 1.5 hours on 12/31, so we missed our Madrid connection to JFK.

We ran like bats out of hell and approached the gate, eager to find out if we had made it in time. 4 very uninterested personnel told us they'd call us ""soon"" which didn't answer our question. 

Those express flights have no room, and they charge for tea, even when they mess up your flight!

Then we go from London to JFK, totally missed our New Years Eve plans by the way, and are still at the airport waiting for luggage when 2018 rings in. We wait and wait, no luggage. We spend an hour waiting and filling our forms. Turns out, my name was tagged on a bag that doesn't belong to me, so this is a huge security issue. 

Did I mention they lost my husband's bag on the way to Tenerife to begin with?? Yes, and the lady in the Tenerife airport said it wasn't there, but we got a call from customs to pick it up, so we spent $45 on an extra cab ride back to the airport to get it, then the airport agent says it wasn't there, but wouldn't look it up and said she didnt know where it was, advised us to wait an hour till the next flight came in.

We started from the gate and suddenly there was an anouncement for four missing persons. They crew suddenly found out, that this people was not boarded but the baggage was. We have to return to a gate to take out the baggage of the unboarded persons. Until now one and a half hour delay. No drinks was served in the business class until this time.

"Decent to fly with, appalling customer service",Madrid,Malaga,Domestic,"The flight itself was pretty standard, tiny aircraft but considering the short duration of the flight not too bad. 
Upon landing at baggage claim, looking forward to spending my christmas holidays at home, I realised that my suitcase had a massive gaping hole in the back of it (luckily no personal items were lost) due to the careless manner in which luggage seems to be handled by airport staff. 
After filing my formal report at the Iberia customer service desk in Malaga airport, I was given a slip of paper with a website, phone number and reference number and told to call the next morning. 
Needless to say it has now been 12 days since my first phone call to Iberia and they have yet to resolve my luggage problem. 12 days of calling almost daily, being told ""a supervisor will call you this afternoon"", ""we will send you an email with details to help with your problem"" and ""we are sorry for the inconvenience"", without any of those things ever actually happening. 
Dealing with the incompetence and sheer disregard for paying customers on behalf of this airline's customer service has genuinely affected the quality of my vacation, 
I will definitely be thinking twice before ever booking checked luggage on one of Iberia's flights again.

Mediocre,Santiago,London,International,"The outbound flight was OK with a straightforward transfer through Madrid. Allocated seats were together.  Return: seats in different parts of the aircraft were allocated and it cost 37$US each to change. We changed them at the airport free. The line for check in was much shorter than the line for baggage drop so it  is quicker to check in at the airport. We were served a light lunch, no evening meal, small sandwich for supper, sandwich with fruit and cake for breakfast. 10 hours with 1 small cup of water or juice. At Madrid we had to go through immigration in and out. This took so long we had no time to buy breakfast. We bought coffee on the short haul: 3 € for half a cup of lukewarm water & a sachet of cheap coffee. By the time they had produced milk the water was cold.

The crew were amazing! They were friendly, responded with a smile and assisted whenever they were needed. Couldn’t fault their service, surprised when I read the other reviews about the crew, guess I got lucky :-)

Only a call to Iberia's office informed me that my ticket has been reissued and that my flight has been changed to the new airport rather than cancelled. The flight also added a fuel stopover in Las Palmas which adds some extra time to the journey. On the ground everything was smoth however, although the flight was delayed for about an hour and a half.
Iberia's business class is basically wider economy seats with a gap seat between the aisle and the window seats.

Iberia's business class are basically wider economy seats where the middle seat can't get booked.
The biggest perk of flying business class with Iberia is the lounge access, if you're not flying with extra luggage which is another reason to pick business.

300E upgrade from Prem Econ to Business - well worth it,Madrid,Chicago,International,"I recently flew from Madrid to Chicago on an Iberia A330.  I had booked Prem Economy and was offered a 300E upgrade to Business during my on-line check in.  I’ve not flown long haul on Iberia before and had been reluctant as my impression of their reputation was not particularly good.  

I was very pleased with my choice to fly and to upgrade.  I think I would have been perfectly happy in Prem Economy, as they (along with BA, AA, and LH) have created a “real” upgraded class of service.  With that said, I felt the upgrade was worth the money.  Business Class was not full so service was particularly attentive.  Good Spanish wines were a bonus...the food was good - though perhaps not up to the standard of the best Business Class offers from other airlines.  Flying with Iberia out of Madrid also had the advantage of better facilities in the terminal, including a vastly better lounge in Terminal 4S than I have experienced when flying short haul out of Madrid.

Here they took our boarding passes.  wait.  finally an other bus (crowed) picked us up. to an other terminal. In and out of bus.  thy took our boarding passes again.  after a wait someone with wheelchair picked me up and drove me (a long way) to another terminal.  Again a wrong one.

The big bird of Spain,Budapest,Madrid,Europe,"In the last few years, we flew with Iberia several times. Partly because they’re one world carriers and partly to avoid Heathrow, that isn’t our favorite airport. In 2017 we flew from Bp to Madrid and back on one member of the Airbus A320 family, and from Madrid to Malaga and again on a small airplane operated by Air Nostrum, which is Iberia regional.   
What I like about this carrier is the cheerful mood. Partly due to the staff and somewhat to the fact that most travelers are holidaymakers. The flight is short, at least according to our standards, since we used to have 10+ hours flights. Roughly 3 hours “flies” away quickly, everyone can survive that, even those who do not like this mode of transport. The trip doesn’t provide entertainment and no freebies either. If you want to eat or drink BYO or pay for it. Since we have access to the business lounge, it isn’t a problem for us, because in between the two flights in Madrid, at the Iberia lounge we can have a few bites and a drink.

Not worth the extra money,Madrid,Basel,Europe,"I fly quite often within Europe and get into KLM, Easyjet, Ryanair, Air France and Iberia airplanes once or twice a month.
I can say fully convinced that nowadays low-cost airlines offer the exact same service than the classic big airlines. I would only make an exception with KLM as they still offer a great service, offer drinks and snacks and always employ very professional crew members.
Iberia, sadly, is trying to lower their costs but they are not doing it on the right way in my opinion. The extra money, that can be some times double the price of a low-cost airline, can't be felt in the service quality. Easyjet aircraft cabins have been refurbished and are the same level today. The crews are usually rude and feel ""superior"" to their low-cost colleagues.
Also low-cost have very fast turnaround times and that makes them push a lot to be on time, while Iberia or Air France have usually longer turnaround times and tend to leave late. 
I'd also like to point out that customers of classic airlines are usually either snobby or uneducated people. I believe these people thinks that a low-cost airplane is not maintained or not taken care of, and might fall from the sky during flight. You can feel straight away that low-cost companies are attracting more open minded people and young people that make the boarding and un-boarding process a lot smoother, the flight quieter and more pleasant and don't complain so much as they know that they're paying for a low cost service. In classic airlines customers are arrogant, not used to fly and complain for everything, as they might be expecting a premium service that it's not longer offered by these companies.

Perfect connection from Vienna to Sao Paulo & back,Vienna,Sao Paulo,International,"Just in brief: for many years flights with Iberia to Latin America were dreaded experiences, to be be avoided at all costs.

Not so anymore. This year I took Iberia 3 times when travelling to Brazil and everytime I came away perfectly happy. The new business class is the best which is offered for long haul flights to Latin America, service is impeccably friendly (not something which is exeperienced with some of their competitors), flights are always on time, food is great, the seat transforms into a very comfortable bed...

Worst airline I've ever experienced,Manchester,Madrid,Europe,"We missed our flight because:
Iberia Express failed to issue our tickets properly despite taking money from our accounts. They advised us this would be solved at check-in but despite us being 1hr early it wasn't BECAUSE THEY DON'T EMPLOY ANY STAFF AT MANCHESTER  AIRPORT and DID NOT ANSWER THE PHONE TO THEIR OWN CONTRACTORS (!) for 45 mins.

So me, my wife and our baby and 3 yr old were stuck in the airport for several hours trying to sort it out.

We were unable to find any solution and simply had to go back home because:
Iberia BLAMED US for them not issuing us with a ticket, falsely claimed that we were late to the check-in (how would they even know with no staff there) and a customer service manager hung up on me after laughing at my complaint.

We have received no compensation and no offer of alternative flights. So, good luck everyone.",December 2017,"December 7, 2017",1.0,,,,1.0,,,1.0,
Price OK. The worst service experience ever.,Miami,Madrid,International,"I booked economy plus believing that it might be similar with the ones in British Airways or Lufthansa. Worst customer service ever from the crew. Their attitude is like they are doing us a favor flying with them. The only message they keep telling the passenger is that they  were the more "" on time "" airline, which I cannot deny is good.
Starting service dinner they were offering meat or pasta (as all of the airlines usually do), after 4 or 5 passengers were served , one loud men crew member shout to another ""no more meat give them pasta"". A gentlemen behind my seat, also in economy plus was son surprise that he inquired that how come after only serving 4 people there was no meat.  Also, the same attitude when servicing drinks even telling them that one was willing to pay to get some.
If you only want a little more comfortable seat than economy and does not care about service at all, go for it. That is the only thing you get for paying little more than an economy. Then, the restroom issue; God forbid you go to the ones in front of the aircraft ( 3 feet from economy plus ) the crew will in a rude way yield in front of the other passengers "" you must go to the restrooms located in the  rear of the aircraft"".
The bottom line : they need to be trained on how to address the customers even if you travel in regular economy. Try reading the description of Economy Plus in their web and then fly and verify it.

Worst service on an airline in 30 years!,Oviedo,London,Europe,"I had to book this one as I was back from a 3 days business trip from Valencia, Madrid to Oviedo. 
If the flight from Madrid was ok, this one was booked through BA (they work with Iberia to serve their customers on some routes). The cost of the ticket was €380 economy.

The temperature within the cabin was very hot and uncomfortable. I was told the pilot refused to power the air in an extremely hot cabin (low oxygen as the flight just arrived from London) - not to mention the external temperature was 3C! 

I politely asked for water and I was brought a cup of water after 15min - I wasn’t sure where did the flight attendant got that. When I asked to have the water from a bottle (so at least I know what I drink), I was told they can’t do it and I need to purchase water! 

The flight attendant with her colleague start arguing with me and when I said they should respect their customers, they were so ignorant! I smiled and left.

It is a pity BA are mixing up their flights with untrained Spanish flight attendants!

This morning check in was busy as usual, but smooth in the priority lane. I was told to put my carry on on the scale and was told it was too big and heavy, as it was a small plane. That was a lie as they always use either Airbus 319 or 320 and my bag fits just fine. I said I would retrieve it in Madrid rather than have it checked through.
The flight was fine, not even completely full; baggage claim in Madrid was on carousel 18 of 19 and took seemingly forever. My bag was one of the first off. So far so good!
I then had to go through security, which was nearly empty. When I went to take my laptop out, I opened its compartment and it was gone.
THEY STOLE MY LAPTOP!!

Other than that everythign was pleasant and sufficient; no food or beverages for economy class and not any free servise.

dirty Aircraft,Madrid,Santiago,International,"The price point wasn't bad for this flight, although I disliked being able to select my seat number prior to check in being open. (I booked through a third party carrier and it was the code share and so selecting a seat was not an option, even if I wanted to pay). This meant we ended up with seats in the middle of the aircraft and further back in the cabin than I would normally chose.
When I opened my tray it had not been cleaned. Complaining to cabin crew was worthless. They just shrugged. I cleaned it myself and asked them to take away the sanitiser cloth I used. Another shrug. Had to dispose of it myself in the end. 
Charm school would do nothing to improve the crew's attitude. Speaking politely and smiling at them elicited nothing but more rudeness. Not really sure what they are paid for exactly, but being optimistic I kept trying to smile and see what happened.
It must have been a really bad day for them as the crew that we had on the return leg were much nicer, friendlier and helpful. Cabin was still dirty though. I know they have tight turn arounds to cater for, but the numbers of cleaners that got off the flight should have meant cleanliness at the very least.
Seats were fairly comfortable considering the long journey. Meals were nothing to complain about, standard airline fare. Drinks were not served often enough and we resorted to just going and getting one when we felt like it. At least the staff didn't object to that.
Would use them again if I had to and the price was right.
I did like the bidding option on the upgrades. More airlines could use this method. We managed to get an upgrade for a short flight on our return journey and it was well worth the price. It was a shame that we werent able to get the upgrade on the long leg of the journey as it would have been interesting to see if the cabin crew were able to raise more of a smile in the business class part.",September 2017,"December 6, 2017",3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.0

Quality vs Price = Iberia,Sao Paulo,Lisbon,International,"Been flying with Iberia for the last 18 years from and to Brazil to several Europe destinations, sometimes solo, once with my 2 year old daughter, and lately with the all family. Always on Economy class and with one stop/connection in Madrid. Never had any trouble, and never seen anyone have any. My choice to Iberia was always based on the price versus what they offer, and price was always the best, the service always equal and better than the competition I experienced before (British, TAP, TAM and the dreadful Swissair). The food is just fine, with 2 options on Economy class (You can also request something different using they website before the flight), enough drink options and the breakfast is just delicious. On-board entertainment is complete, movies, music, TV series, new and classics at your front in some kind of Tablet with touch screen. Wifi and GSM available for a price, never tested GSM, but my last trip I experienced the worst Wi-Fi connection ever, 6 months ago was perfect. The seats are very comfortable, the space between seats is the same as every other company I used, blanket and pillow offered are good. Everything is well cleaned and looks/feels brand new. Attendants are very nice and always happy to help. In all the flights, there was never any delay, and sometimes arrived earlier. On land the service depends on local people, so that is hard to judge, but despite that, I was always treated like I was with a first class ticket on my hands. One detail that is quite good to me, is that I can travel with two 32KG bags if you have a Iberia Plus card (its free and very easy to get). For the last 6 years I always buy the tickets from Iberia.com, as they are cheaper and way easy to buy than in any other agency.

Also the breakfast of a ham and cheese croissant seemed a bit feeble. The toilets had no bonuses like moisturiser or wet wipes. 
Overall the flight was smooth and punctual. The big disappointment was they charge you to select a seat even during online check in 24 hour before you fly.

Lost wallet and difficult management of situation,Santiago de Compostela,Madrid,Domestic,"I left my wallet in the front pocket of my sit and when I got back to recovered after hours of insisting to get to the plain before the next day, the cleaning company was there and the wallet was gone. 
IBERIA not only made it so complicated to access to the plain but tried to discourage me to do so. But a great guardia civil empathise with my situation and by 3 am decided to go into the aircraft to check it out. The wallet was gone by then after the cleaning company already “cleaned” the airplane including my wallet. 

I cannot proof anything but it’s clear what happened. 

My complain here was the attitude of IBERIA staff who not only tried to discourage me to move things forward but emailed me the next day to say that the investigation wasn’t successful. 
I am sure it takes more than a day to check with all staff specially from 3rd party companies to interrogate all personal who was involved in the aircraft cleaning and catering.

baggage forgotten,Vienna,Madrid,Europe,"Me and my friends went to Madrid for the Mad Cool festival.
Our flight was delayed about 20minutes from Vienna and when we arrived in Madrid at 11pm they told us, that our baggage (3 items) was forgotten in Vienna. Just 20 items have been forgotten - coincidence?

We were talking to the staff there and got the information that our baggage should arrive the next day about 4pm.
It seems that we were the only ones who got bag with toiletarticles  because I asked.

We stayed there from Wednesday night till Sunday afternoon.
One problem was, that we booked a flat by AirBnB and so we have to be at home when the baggage arrive.
The first one we got on Friday midday - the second and third one at Saturday midday.

At this weekend a seller told me was the poorest weather in Madrid since years - monsoon-like downpour - my friends had their rain jackets in their luggage.

At the end our home flight was also delayed without any information. The departure time was moved from 1550 to 1610 and we didn't got any information why... In general you see on the information board that a flight is delayed or canceled - but in this case it was just moved...

At the end I was a bit agry about myself because if I would have booked the flight with AirBerlin it would had cost 15€ more - drinks would have been included and we wouldn't had this kind of problem.

Iberia to Florence 9 hour detour,New York City,Florence,International,"We flew out of JFK Sep 4, Iberia 6252. It was supposed to have a 1:40 layover in Madrid and then onto Florence, Italy by about 2pm Italy time. Typical overnight trans-Atlantic flight. Well- when we got to Madrid we naturally had to be processed thru EU Customs -with about 200 other travelers. Like I said, a 1:40 layover but the Customs took 1:55. We missed our connection to FLR and Iberia was shrug-shouldered useless. They KNEW 45-60 people on that flight from JFK were tied up in Customs. Why didn’t they hold the flight? Why didn’t they put us on a faster, shorter line?  Why did they -through their negligence- purposely strand us in Madrid?  The resulting scene at the “customer service” kiosk was horrendous. “You can come back tomorrow and fly to FLR standby”, was their only no-extra-charge-offer. And that offer did not include an over night hotel room. To avoid wasting one or two added days enroute to our vacation, we eventually opted for the only other flight to FLR - via Dusseldorf.  That’s right - If we didn’t want to pay for an over night stay in Madrid (plus meals) and MAYBE get a flight to FLR the next day - or maybe the NEXT day - we would have to pay for an additional side trip to Dusseldorf - and from there to FLR.

We could not see the gate number displayed on the Board, we asked at the vueling desk who were carrying out the flight, the woman never looked up at us, but just pointed to the gate opposite her  glassed in desk, we went over to the gate which said Paris. We then went to look at the board which said IB 5731 was now changed to gate D30, so we made our way there only to find that was not the case. we wnet back to the woman at Vueling only to be told that our flight had closed some forty minutes, we asked why she hadn't told us which gate the flight had gone from as we had seen her at 10,25, she told us she thought we wanted to go to Paris. So we landed up losing our flight, car hire and hotel monies, these airlines now treat you as cattle, they couldn't care less, I can only imagine the flight was overbooked and shut the gate early.

What was more exasperating was that Iberia’s attitude was so, you’ll have to buy another ticket.

"Lack of Customer service, in the air and on the ground!",Tokyo,Madrid,International,"Took a flight with my family from Tokyo on Iberia on July the 1st,   Couldn’t check in the night before, got to the airport extra early so that we could try and get seats near the front because of a fairly quick connection, was told that this was done for us, when we got on we were approx 6 rows from the back. Really poor service on the flight, delays on the runway, not communicated, no drinks offered for over 2hrs, food just being slapped down in front of us, no choice given, when we asked if their was a choice you would have thought we had asked for gold bracelet by the tutting and look we got. When my wife got up to see if she could get a drink the steward was sat down reading a book and told her to help herself.
Used their website to complain, filled in all the details, then told it could take 28 days for a response, 28 days later they sent an email asking for flight details and the such, sent these in again, no response. Filled in their website again and contacted them through their Facebook page, nothing different from the website, FB team got back to us, chased up the same info, I sent them screen shots of all the emails and references, they said they would pass these on to customer services team as they were unable to intervene.

In theory there is a choice of meals, but the flight attendant decided to give one to me without asking.

Iberia? Possibly an airline to avoid!,London,Cape Town Central,International,"Well, so far this planned holiday has not happened. Using an online flight search, we came upon a decently priced option through Carlton Leisure - booking in September for a holiday next Easter. All done and dusted, we thought.
Then, in November, the wheels came off. Iberia made a schedule change which saw our return flights having to change. This was fixed by using a BA flight but then it was noticed (by ourselves, not Carlton Leisure) that the Madrid to Johannesburg outward bound flight had changed to leaving Madrid almost 19 hours before we were due to fly from London! 
After several emails and onlince chats it was found that Iberia had brought in a schedule change and could not accommodate us on our planned outward journey. They offered a flight earlier which we could not take (due to work commitments) and seemed to think that was enough. 
Funnily enough, the return flight was changed from Iberia to BA to get us home but that was not, apparently, thought of for the outward bound. The result?

Cabin crew not alert,Madrid,London,Europe,"As a former PPL (Privat Pilot Licence) i always follow with interest what´s happening during a flight.  Flying has always been my passion and  I had the priviligue to ride in the cockpit of a big airliner on many occasions. But also the average performance in the cabin catches my attention. ""The cabin crew is here for your safety"", is a common phrase during preparation of a flight announced via the P/A system. On this particular flight, we had a normal flight from Madrid to London. But upon landing the aircraft had to wait temporarily for a parking gate, as it was occupied by another aircraft about to depart.  As it often  happens, in the moment the aircraft came to a halt, half of the passenger in my section of the big A340 raised and opened the overhead bins, despite the fact that the seatbelt sign was not yet turned off.and it was obvisously that the aircraft hadn´t reached it´s parking area. In fact, it had stopped far away in order not to block for other passing traffic. The cabin crew did intervene only after lots of the luggage from the overhead compartments had been removed by the standing passengers in the aisle. Then the aircraft started to taxi towards the parking gate, apprx 4-5 minutes away. The doors for the overhead bins remained open during the entire rest of the taxi, as did the luggage standing in the aisle. Now you may think that this is nothing to talk about. But keep in mind that the greatest aircraft accidents during ll times have happened on the ground, not in the air. To certify a new type and model  the manufacturer needs tio demonstrate that the aircraft can be evacuated within 90 seconds. This is a rigid and necessary ruel which is performed without exception. The cabin crew in this particular flight did not do their job and should have phoned the capatin to tell him wait until they have replaced the luggage back, closed the locks, and brought the passengers back to their seat. Instead the aircraft continued with the aisles blocked, passengers standing in line and the overhead compartments completely opened.   Upon leaving the aircraft I made a remark about this to the chief flight attendant, who´s only response was to be arrogant. My impression of Iberia is after this lttle incident not the best.

Surprisingly good inflight experience,London,Havana,International,"I struggled to find any direct flights when we looked to fly to Havana even though I have been led to believe that Virgin fly direct there, so booked BA/Iberia via Madrid.  I was a little apprehensive as I had not flown long haul with Iberia before and their short haul flights tend to be basic and on fairly tired aircraft much of the time.  Some of the reviews of their flights were also not great.

However, the flights were on relatively new airbus aircraft with good entertainment systems and USB charging points in all the seats. The leg room was a bit tight, but the seats were reasonably comfortable and we particularly appreciated the adjustable height headrests that were a big help when you were trying to get comfortable.  There was a good choice of films and TV to watch and the flight-tracking function was good too. 

My only complaints were that firstly, despite being booked through British Airways the whole way through, neither BA or Iberia would let us check-in for the whole journey or see our seats on the Iberia legs of the trip online. Secondly the layout of the aircraft cabin meant that there was very little room if you wanted to stand up and stretch or walk a little.
