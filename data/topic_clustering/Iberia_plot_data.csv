But their customer service is the worst, they literally stole me 96,000 avios and 600$ (I have a claim with the DOT open). Fly with Iberia only if you NEVER plan to cancel or change your flight, even if it's refundable."
10.7433109283447,4.06723880767822,"Iberia Seat Booking",1,"Iberia changed so many times our flight schedule. 20 days before departure one flight segment was cancelled. When check-in paid seats disappeared. When I called Iberia I only got answers like - we can do nothing, even when alternatives were available. Iberia is a kindergarden. Not a serious airline."
10.1737413406372,6.03196811676025,"Iberia Flight Delays",1,"Facts: 1. Poor check-in counter staff availability. As a result long queues on the check-in counter. Staff arrived 90 mins before flight departure. Before that there was no sign of Iberia on the check-in counters at Lisbon Airport. Had to ask other airline staff for the Iberia check-in counter.
2. Gate information was disclosed only 30 mins before flight departure. We had over 90 mins at Madrid airport to catch our connecting flight. No airline staff informed us about the updated gate or the terminal one needs to go to get the connecting flight. Unprofessional ground staff.
3. Baby stroller which was carried via cabin baggage was missed by airline staff along with over 10 cabin baggages at Madrid airport during the connecting flight transfer. Passengers were queueing up at Cairo airport to file their missing baggage report.
4. NSAS (delegated representative of Iberia at Cairo airport) gave us a PIR form with all info without the PIR reference number.
5. Iberia staff who cannot be approached by any way other than a phone call asked repeatedly for the PIR number. Iberia website is useless without a PIR number.
6. We called Iberia phone number for baggage delay over 7 times and each time the customer support will ask to choose a IVRS option which did not exist. Unprofessional phone support.
7. Iberia Instagram profile responded back saying they do not recognise NSAS as their representative. There is no counter of Iberia at Cairo international Airport and NSAS features Iberia logo along with many other airlines for baggage and logistics support. Iberia itself does not know about NSAS and cannot get in touch with NSAS (the entity they hired for Cairo operations).
8. The website for filing the delayed baggage claim does not work and gets stuck on a loop of """"please wait"""". 

Very frustrating at several levels. I wish they file bankruptcy soon. Such a sham should not be allowed to operate at this level of negligence."

It's been over three weeks since these incompetent airlines have lost my luggage. Over one week ago they said they have found it and they're sending it over to my home address in Poland. They sent it from Madrid to Munich and then it was meant to be sent to Krakow... after few days I called the airlines to find out what is going on with my luggage, I couldn't believe when they said the luggage is being sent from Munich back to Madrid and they don't know why, probably some mistake...Until today I have no idea where is my luggage and I don't think they do..."

- Long queues to check in luggage at OSL airport. I waited more than 1 hour in the queue.
- Messy and slow boarding process at MAD airport.
- Charges for everything like a low-cost airline.
- Not possible to change a pre-booked luggage allowance from 15kg to 23kg; I had to buy a new 23kg luggage allowance for 75 EUR.
- Delayed flight in MAD caused me to miss my connection for a domestic flight in GRU.
- Delayed luggage at GRU. Long queue at GRU with only one staff member to support all passengers who did not receive their luggage. I do not understand why my luggage was missed. My connection in MAD was more than 4 hours.

Iberia canceled our carefully planned business class tickets at the last minute - only by email. When we called, there was not option with Iberia that would get us to our destination in time to receive our dog. We asked to cancel and to receive a refund. Instead, they went ahead and booked another flight - and sent notice by email. This option did not work as we would arrive only the day after our dog. Finally, after hours navigating the horrible customer service we were granted a refund - maybe - this we will only know in 72 hours. This arbitrary cancelation cost us thousands in extras when we had to rebook with another airline to arrive on time. Horrible airline, avoid at all costs."

The flight attendants were nice and very attentive. The food were good as well.  What made this four stars go into 1 is that they made me wait all that time looking dumb waiting for my bag when they knew it was still in Madrid.

My brand new luggage came back with two missing wheels and beat up. I can’t seem to file a claim online it kept giving me errors and took forever to speak to someone on customer service line. When we finally got someone they barely spoke English and after all that explaining the call drops.  By the way when they called for us to get my bag we had to go to the car and we had to ask the man to open the trunk for us. He didn’t even get out of the vehicle. Very unprofessional.

They were good once again: very good cabin crews (a mix of senior & junior staff), the meals were tasty and well-presented (by Gate Gourmet, the MAD sector has meals by DO & CO which produces even better meals), and both flights were on time.

Why not 5 stars? The aircraft they used both ways (EC-IJN) is over 20 years old, the seats and the legroom are the same as in economy, and there is no IFE on the older A321's.

All cabin crews were very good, and the purser on the BCN HEL sector on 08 December was outstanding (I guess his name was Ricardo): what a welcoming & professional person who did his job with joy, great motivation and enthusiasm, and comforted a younger passenger afraid of flying throughout the 4-hour flight.

On one leg, it actually made me sick.  We were served the same awful food back to back.  No clear soft drinks were available, ran out of cokes, didn’t have white wine.  Consider another in-flight food provider.

On one leg, I pressed the call button.  No one ever came.  I flagged down an attendant.  Which one is the call button?  Pointing to an area on the panel, the attendant said it was somewhere in that area.  Even then, the attendant didn’t turn the light off.  My video needed resetting.  I’ll tell someone.  Thirty minutes later, still no reset.  One hour later and three request later, the lead attendant did reset and followed up to confirm that the reset occurred.  

The flight crew was insensitive to the needs of passengers.  While they were serving passengers, and blocking the aisles, they refused to allow passengers to use the lavatories in business class.  These were long legs and the lavatories need to be cleaned during flights.

One leg, from Madrid to Barcelona, was delayed and cancelled because of weather in BCN.  No staff to direct passengers who arrived at the gate.  Limited staff at the customer service desk, creating extremely long lines.  There were employees sitting at the gates, but weren’t helpful.

I said i wanted to complain and was told I could. How do I do it """"you have to complete the on line forms""""  which of course  were on the same system that was not working.

Our (me and my team) flight Madrid-Paris was cancelled, we had to go to Brussels instead the day after and take a train from Brussels to Paris. Our 3 suitcases didn't arrive. Very hard to reach customer service, they give you a number that doesnt do luggage service and tell you to call back the same number and choose another option , just that it doesnt give you any options, etc. My assistant called to different airports services and spent hours on the phone. 2 bags where tracked in bagtracer, 1 stayed unfound. LUCKILY there where airtags in the bags. After about 5 days 2 of the bags came back, delievered by a guy who was stinking of alcohol. One bag broken.

Eventually it got on a flight to Brussels and someone at Brussels airport told me and my assistant it was going to Paris. I got a notification and saw excactly where it was on the airport, but still noone at Iberia could be reached, and they where just telling us to wait.
After 8 days my boyfriend went to the airport with my Ipad to beep the Airtag, and managed to get it - from the """"lost and found"""" area for Vueling, on a terminal unrelated to Iberia, who totally had abandonded the case !! I would never have gotten it back if it wasnt because of the airtag. The way Iberai handled this was really awful.

After days of back-and-forth communication with both Iberia and Sri Lankan Airlines, I learned that the cancellation occurred due to a payment issue between the two airlines—something completely beyond my control.

This meant we couldn’t extend our legs due to the lack of a seat in front, and we were stuck staring at the inflexible kitchen wall throughout the flight. Additionally, the entertainment system was severely lacking, with only a fold-out screen that couldn't compare to the in-seat ones we expected.

The onboard service further compounded the disappointment. The crew was inattentive at best, and basic requests felt like an imposition. For an airline like Iberia, we expected much better service and accountability.

This experience has left us thoroughly dissatisfied, and we would not recommend flying Iberia Premium Economy to anyone. The lack of customer care and attention to detail is simply unacceptable."

I even paid extra to choose our seats—a window and aisle—for comfort. Without any explanation, Iberia changed our seats to the middle of the plane. Despite explaining the situation, we were told there was nothing they could do. To make matters worse, they forced us to check our carry-on bags, which contained all our clothes.

Our flight included a layover in Madrid. Due to fog, the flight from Porto had to turn back to Madrid, which I understand wasn’t their fault. However, when we landed at 10 AM, everyone had to rebook. The next available flights to Porto were at 3:40 PM and 7 PM. Given the long wait and our dog’s exhaustion on her first flight, we agreed to take a flight to Vigo at 3pm, an hour away from Porto, after Iberia assured us our checked bags would be transferred.

Surprise, surprise—our three checked bags didn’t arrive in Vigo. The agent informed us that the bags were sent to Porto at 4:40 PM, but when we drove to Porto Airport, they weren’t there. We opened a claim around 7 PM on Saturday, and it wasn’t until Monday that Iberia confirmed our bags were actually in Madrid. Even then, they couldn’t promise a delivery date, saying it could be Monday or the next day.

Their service got even worse. They delivered *one bag per day*—starting Tuesday and finishing Thursday. This mishandling ruined our plans. We had prepaid for a hotel outside Porto from Wednesday to Thursday, but we had to cancel since we were still waiting for the last bag. The hotel couldn’t refund my $160; instead, they offered a credit for future use. But we don’t plan on returning to Porto, and Iberia refused to compensate us for the loss.

On top of that, since we had to buy extra clothes during our trip, our bags were overweight on the return, and Iberia wouldn’t refund the overweight fees either. This was supposed to be a vacation, not a disaster. Iberia’s lack of care and logistical incompetence ruined our trip. Their refusal to take responsibility or reimburse us for the consequences of their failures is unacceptable.

I’ll never fly Iberia again, and I wouldn’t recommend them to anyone. This company clearly doesn’t prioritize its customers. Absolutely disgraceful service."

So if you have to use the bathroom to bad for you, because with this great airline if you ask them to use the bathroom bathroom they will answer “not right now…” with the same attitude of an I-pad kid who got their iPad taken away, and if you ask if it will be possible before boarding to use the bathroom you will be met by their most used answer; “I don’t know…” with the spice of rolling their eyes. 

In air the seats are nothing to celebrate, but then again you can have your expectations high in economy. If you’re lucky your seat will be equipped with a blanket and a pillow, if not guess you have to be quick and snatch some (because the flight gets very cold).
But besides that the seats are equipped with some pretty neat screens, that contains games, movies, audio etc., these screens also contains the buttons for the light and to call a flight attendant. But don’t be fooled! Just because there is a button for service, doesn’t mean you’ll get any! 

On this flight I called for service 5 times, and a flight attendant showed up 0 times out of those 5. I don’t know if it feels worse being ghosted by an ex or flight attendant who passes you several times. 

But you might wonder, why would a person be so consistent on calling service just to be ignored? Well it was to ask if the food onboard contained any pineapple, since I’m highly allergic and prefer not to die, even tho it already fell like I was in hell. And to my luck a flight attendant walked by, and I finally managed to catch her attention and ask if the food had any pineapple, and her answer was “mhmm I don’t know…”. 

Great guess I had to either yolo, or just not eat. 

Later on the flight I had to use the bathroom, the one on the left was occupied so I just used the one on my right. Just to be surprised, that the mirror was popped out and hanging on for dear life, revealing whatever isolation was going on behind it. Luckily there was a flight attendant right next to the bathroom contemplating life, and I told her about it, her respond? “Mmmkay”.
This left a bit of awkward silence so I asked “can I still use it?” And of course I should  have known the answer “I don’t know” perfected with a roll of the eyes. 

So choose Iberia, if you wanna know what r hell feels like."

Be very CAREFUL when buying tickets with Iberia. They send you the flight confirmation and then cancel the transaction without notifying you. DO NOT trust the Iberia platform. I bought my ticket directly from Iberia, received the confirmation by email, and made sure I had it in my Iberia app. The day of my flight arrived, I tried to check in on the app, and the reservation didn’t appear. I checked the email and confirmed my reservation, but I couldn’t check in. That’s where my nightmare began.

I called Iberia, and they informed me that the reservation didn’t exist. They asked me to write via WhatsApp, which I did, but I received very little help from the agents. They couldn’t give me any clear answers because they had to check everything first. I went to the airport, and to my surprise, Iberia doesn’t have its own staff there, so no one could help me. I ended up buying a ticket with American Airlines from SJU - MIA - MAD, even though my ticket was supposed to be a direct flight SJU - MAD - SJU. My husband traveled on that direct flight, while I had to take a different flight, paying almost double.

Later, I wrote to Iberia, and of course, I haven’t received a response. The Iberia computer system, first of all, should not have generated a confirmation if the transaction was incomplete. Secondly, if it did generate the confirmation, it should have sent a cancellation notification.

I want a refund for the difference in what I paid for the ticket I had to buy. This chaos was caused by Iberia.

That’s 11 people, folks, all with lost luggage. We landed in Madrid and were on our way to meet a train to Barcelona then catch a cruise. This airline is miserable.  We read Reddit advice every step of the way which warned us that if Iberia lost our luggage we were in real trouble. Believe it. Miserable. So I’m glad to share the step-by-step misery we suffered from Iberia Airlines. First, Ill  jump to the end: we returned home after three weeks of travel and 2-3 weeks later, for several of us- we finally got our luggage. Iberia sent us a check, for 11 people, for $1500. For all of us. So I’m going to share what you have to expect from Iberia Airlines. Day one- lost luggage day- landed in Madrid- exhausted.  We spent 3- hours, along with over a hundred other passengers finding the right line then filing the proper claims. The people were nice- just not enough of them- and it was 2 hours in line.  By the way, despite filing our claims as instructed by the staff- most of us never received a single communication about our individual luggage.  Iberia has received multiple messages from me. I’ve NEVER received one word from them. So. Missed our train. Paid an extra $700 for train fees and long delay. Paid an extra $100 for transport fees as we arrived in Barcelona super late.  Lost an enjoyable afternoon of our  vacation in Madrid and an evening with the rest of our party in Barcelona.

First hour they serve a meal which was fine. After meal service, trash accumulated, they disappeared. Eight hours later, they drop off the little sandwiches before landing. In between, they are in their galley for 8 hours, not bothering to pick up trash maybe every two hours, is that so much to ask? By the last few hours of flight, the plane is a biohazard, several of the bathrooms are cordoned off, presumably because people are dropping their trash in the toilets. When I spoke to a flight attendant about it and told them there wouldn't be such a problem if they picked up some trash a few times during the flight, I was met with a scoff that it was not their problem.

We contacted Iberia customer service and the gentleman we spoke with said the flight was not cancelled. We asked him if he was sure because google flights says canceled.  He said no sir not cancelled so based on what the Iberia customer service representative’s confident answer we proceeded to leave and drove to the airport decided to get there 4 hours before our flight just in case the representative  was wrong. We got to the Iberia line and at the counter the ladies working the ticketing and baggage checkin would not check in anyone and would not say if flight was canceled or not. They would not answer our question, they were rude and just told us to continue and wait in line.  After 2 hours of waiting in line with no one answering us if flight was cancelled and if we can take another flight to make it to Barcelona.  We were told no flights until the next morning.  We asked why we did not receive email re cancellation and why the customer rep on the phone did not give us the correct information and why we had to wait in line for two hours without any response as to whether flight was indeed cancelled or not so we could look into other options and we did not get any apologies nor any explanations. Everyone was so unprofessional and rude and  none of them had any idea how to respond to questions. This was our first time flying with Iberea and we had purchased food from the special menu and had paid extra 200 dollars each of us for our seats for more leg room.  We took a different airline and flew to Barcelona because we needed to get there for a wedding and the flight had a stop   Lay over and no leg room we got to Barcelona very late.  Since we had our return ticket with Iberia for nonstop flight again paid seats we were going to use that in the way back a week later which was today.  Prior going to the airport once again we tried to check in and no flight was coming up as if it was a ghost airline but the interesting thing was the airline once again had not sent us a cancellation email in fact we had received an email saying your get ready for your flight 2 days prior.  When we got to the airport again ahead of time the Checkin desk representatives were extremely rude and unprofessional and would not give us a straight answer. The flight had been cancelled god knows when and there was no trace of it no email re cancellation. We kept being told to contact the phone number they had for the customer service airline and they couldn’t help us with any thing there we had to call and deal with a representative on the phone.  They would not respond to any of our questions and kept being rude and unprofessional as if it was our fault and not the airlines fault   We were stuck at the airport taking to representatives over the phone and those representatives also had no answer for us. We are now stuck over night as they could not offer us a a flight to leave the same day despite other airlines availabilities they offered a flight that will get us back to Los Angeles two days from today with stops making me not being able to make it back to my work on Friday and missimg important work meetings. I am exhausted and extremely upset of how Iberea airlines had canceled both of our going and return flights without any email notifications of cancellation and how we were treated.

Flying Business class from London Heathrow to Quito Ecuador via Madrid. Check-in at Heathrow was relatively pain free and the priority lane through immigration was helpful. The business class lounge at Heathrow is shared with BA and various other airlines and was absolutely rammed with passengers but eventually we managed to get two seats together. There was a good range of food on offer in the lounge and the drinks were regularly topped up. The business class seats on the short haul stage from Heathrow are not much more than a standard seat (an extra inch or two perhaps) but you get three seats between two. There was also a lack of overhead storage space. The food was acceptable with a choice of main course, also a reasonable selection of alcoholic or non-alcoholic drinks. On the long-haul part of our journey we had fully flat beds, a good choice of films etc on the entertainment system. The food was again acceptable with good choice of starter, main and deserts. The only downside was that it was served very soon after take-off, the crew would appear to do this so that they then get, on this flight, seven hours rest.

Although they are partners with major carriers such as BA and American, they do not play by the rules of their own game. Most flights to places inside Spain from other EU countries or from other more distant places must pass through Madrid Airport. Madrid Airport is very large and far more complicated than their website suggests. Furthermore, most employees you will encounter for help with directions and procedures do not speak anything except Spanish. And...they are working as third party outside contractors to Iberia, not the airline itself. Iberia picks certain flights for certain destination connections. You cannot change them easily when you book. Nor can even top travel agencies such as American Express. 

We had booked and paid in advance for a round trip from London to Seville through Amex. Iberia gave a connection time of under two hours. This sounds okay except our flight was very late in take off and arrival do to nothing we could see. the airport was chaos unlike what Iberia had told us at Heathrow. We had just 40 miniutes to go through passport control, security, and take a 13 minute train ride to a distant terminal. We arrived just as the final people were loading and were refused embarkation. Amex could not rebook us because we were in Iberia's control. the rebooking agent listed us as no shows. Did not even offer us anything but standby on a local budget airline even though we later learned that there was an empty Iberia express to Seville leaving in less than 90 minutes. We lerned that by wandering around until we found the only Iberia true help desk. Had to buy biz class walk up seats for nearly $800 each for a 50 minute flight.

The flight there was perfect, everything was orderly and we received proper attention and accommodations, including dinner, snack, pillow, blanket, and headphones. We had a working television. On the flight back, though, Murphy’s law took hold. And LEVEL, and by extension Iberia (whom is responsible for the operation of LEVEL) are to blame. 

1. There was no order when it came to boarding the plane. There was no group calling, or preference for those that had disabilities, children, or strollers. Everything was a free for all. 
2. While they were admitting passengers, among the mayhem, they had us descend the escalators, where we thought we were to board the plane. There was a flight of spiral stairs, with no option for elevators. NO OPTION FOR ELEVATORS FOR THOSE WITH DISABILITIES. A complete criminality and danger for its passengers. Having been traveling with my grandmother, her among others had experienced trouble, pain, and dangerous circumstances coming down to a BUS, that would take us to the airplane and would make us go up the STAIRS onto the plane as well. Completely criminal. 
3. As this flight was operated by Iberia, we expected to receive our dinner meal, as well as some assortment of snacks and water. They did NOT feed us, seemingly choosing passengers at random no matter if they had or had not “pre-ordered their meals”, which was complete lunacy considering they still asked passengers what meal they desired, and were left with many leftovers. They also did not notify or message that we had to request meals in advance. My grandmother, who is hypoglycemic and suffers from high blood pressure, could have suffered serious consequences aboard this flight, with no consideration from the airline. It was DISCRIMINATORY AND INHUMANE.
4. We were also not given the basic amenities such as a pillow, blanket, or headphones. There was a TV screen behind each seat that served as decoration, as it did not turn on the entire flight. There was not even a functioning outlet.
5. Aside from the abhorrent and inhumane conditions that we were subjected to during a 10 HOUR FLIGHT, the staff of LEVEL were unpolished, unprepared, and incredibly rude. They showed no empathy and gave a pretentious “better than you” air. For a ticket over $500, I expected much better conditions. 

For anyone flying internationally, please make sure that you do not fall for this inhumane, money-hungry scheme, and fly through American Airlines, NOT OPERATED BY LEVEL OR Iberia. We have reached a new low."

I expected there to be a TV, no tv, I expected there to be wifi, there was no wifi, at the very least I expected there to be charging ports that work, nope nothing. So for 7 and a half hours, I was bored out of my mind. Thankfully I was smart enough to download movies and TV shows to watch but soon my devices lost their charge.

When we got to the Airport we discovered we were flying with LEVEL.  They start boarding from front to back not the other way around so you are in line for a long time.  The seats barely reclined but we paid to get seats together and my husband's seat was broken and was in the reclined position all the time and he got a metal box under the front seat so he couldn't rest his feet correctly.  The plane shook and sounded like something was going to fall off at takeoff. The worst part was that we discovered our ticket DIDN'T INCLUDE A MEAL!!   We pushed the button to call the flight attendant and they came to turn the light off twice without asking us anything, after the 3rd time my husband raised his voice to get the flight attendant's attention to order food  (45 min. after everyone else finished their meal and they only had cold food option to order.).

They seemed to board people from the front and back of the plane which seemed to cause more chaos with so many people trying to board at once. People were pressed up against each other trying to let others through to get to their seats or to put their carry on luggage up. At some point a cluster of 5 passengers including myself and my husband were trapped in a group that could not move until others cleared out. I started laughing out loud because it seemed we were part of some elaborate joke.

We arrived in Madrid to find out premium economy doesn't actually exist for our flight and we're checked in for economy, with absolutely no notification about this. Having paid twice the price of a normal ticket for an area of the plane that doesn't even exist, we went to the customer service desk in Madrid airport so see what we could do and the lady at the desk just shrugged her shoulders at us and said """"not possible"""". We rang the customer care line three times and got through to someone who in fairness tried to help, but on her system she said she couldn't even see proof of us boarding the dublin flight to Madrid!

Like all airlines, they list the aircraft type and a diagram of the seats for seat location so you can sit next to family or friends. The aircraft which was being operated was a Airbus A350-900 for this route.  During this time, I purchased seats near the front of the plane in rows A and B which are a window seat and middle.  On this particular aircraft, it had 3 seats along the window in a row, then a middle section and the same configuration on the other side with two aisles.  Five days before the flight, I logged into the website to check on things.  
So upon logging in, I noticed they changed the aircraft to a Airbus A330-300 series aircraft. My wife's seat is no longer assigned?  I purchased two seats at extra cost to move up front so we could sit together.   I myself still have a assigned seat, because the new aircraft has row A.  It did not have row B,  The Airbus A330-300 only has row A and C, so anybody that was booked in row B just fell off and would be re-assigned 24 hours before the flight.  WHAT KIND OF SYSTEM IS THAT???  Tickets were booked together, why is everyone separated now?  What if kids were separated from their parents because they were booked in row B.   So everybody that was booked in row B was left unassigned.  
Customer service was terrible on this, they would not fix the issue because now some random person, not my wife was now sitting next to me.   You would think if the aircraft changed to a different aircraft type, they would keep parties togehter which booked tickets on the same confirmation number!!!  My wife did not have a separate confirmation number.   I get to the gate to the day of flight to ask the gate agent, sorry the flight was overbooked he said - you will have to ask the passenger on board if you can sit together??

We were scheduled to fly from Lisbon to Madrid onto DFW and then home. The morning of the flight from Lisbon Sept 26, I received an e mail from Iberia in Spanish. I don't read or speak Spanish. Upon reviewing the e mail, there appeared to be a section at the end of the email stating that we owed around 430 Euros each. I had no idea what this was for so we went to the Lisbon airport about three hours before flight time. The line was over two hours long. Once at the counter we were informed that our flight had changed and that our original flight was delayed. Our ticket was changed to a different airline, TAP and we missed our flight. I was asked if I received an e mail. I showed the one in Spanish and explained. The gentleman behind the counter stated that this was wrong that they did not give us enough info before flight time. He got on the phone and fought with someone. We were finally rebooked on the delayed flight to Madrid. However, due to their error, we missed our connection. Once in Madrid the battle really began. We went to the customer service desk. the line there was over an hour long. When I got to the front of the line I was told to go to the other line, another 45 minute wait. People were really pissed. When we finally got to a customer service rep. it got worse. She could NOT have been more unfriendly. She accused us of flying in two days before even thought I showed her our itinerary and boarding passes for the flights. There were no other flights out of Madrid to the US. until the next day. She did everything in her power NOT to provide overnight accommodations and meals. After 40 minutes we were given a voucher for the hotel and meals. The next day, we made our flight to JFK. We sat on the tarmac for 90 minutes before taxi. We had a connection in JFK to Dallas. Our flight landed about 40 minutes before our connection departed. By the time we cleared customs and retrieved our bags our connections was long gone. Back to customer service. Note that there were at least ten (10) other families, couples singles in our same situation Most of them gave up and walked away. This is what Iberia hopes you will do. Now it really gets bad. Again they did their level best NOT to provide lodging dur to their delay. We spent over three hours going back and forth. They would take our info. say they would be right back and disappear. I asked for a supervisor. I was told that she was working a flight and it would be 30 minutes. Over an hour later she shows up and had no idea what was going on. The girl behind the counter finally said he is flight from JFK to DFW You will get home late tonight. I did not have readers on so I took her at her word. I went to the American A/L counter, (they partner with American) and was told, you are flying from JFK to LAX and you get home tomorrow. I went back to the counter found the customer service lady and called her out as being a LIAR to her face. She got upset and walked away. It took us at least another hour to get anything resolved. When we finally got a voucher for a room, I asked about meals. the same girl said, We don't provide meals, you pay and file a claim. I know why she did this. I found out at the hotel that meals are included. Had I not asked and filed a claim, Iberia rightfully would have said T/B you had a voucher and did not use it. A couple of things to note. If you speak Spanish you will be treated a touch better. They do their absolute best to not provide any service after the flight, their fault or not. THEY DO NOT CARE. This was WORST experience that we have every had with any airline. I am not saying don't fly them. Note that at both airports, Madrid/JFK there were what seemed like more people with lost/missing bags than those bags that arrived on their flights. Surprisingly, that was one issue that we did not have. They have made it perfectly clear that the goal of their customer service is to provide NO service and do their best to get you to walk away."

8.34470462799072,7.24233531951904,"Iberia Customer Complaints",1,"Flying with Iberia Airlines has become synonymous with a venture into the abyss of customer service nightmares and endless delays. My recent experience, which I'm sure resonates with many, paints a grim picture of an airline that seems to have lost its way amidst the clouds of organizational chaos and customer neglect.

From the outset, the promise of smooth skies with Iberia quickly turned into a ridiculous journey through a bureaucratic red tape of a kind I’ve never witnessed.

Check-ins that should have been straightforward turn into ordeals, with lines moving at a pace that suggests staff training involves learning how to master the art of slow-motion. When finally at the counter, the hope for efficiency was dashed against the rocks of indifference. 

The customer service, or the lack thereof, is akin to navigating through a labyrinth designed by someone who despises clarity. Calls for assistance are met with a purgatory hell fraught with news of delays and minimal empathy. If you’re looking for a supportive staff, don’t — your cries for assistance will vanish into a void of nebulous answers, leaving passengers in a limbo of uncertainty.

And let's talk about delays - Iberia seems to have patented the art of extending travel time. Flights that are supposed to glide you across the sky instead keep you grounded, sometimes for hours, with explanations as thin as the airline's apologies. These delays aren't just occasional hiccups but appear to be a core feature of the Iberia experience, as if the airline operates on a different time zone of inconvenience.

The straw that stirs the drink of discontent is their handling of these delays. Promises of assistance, whether it's rebooking or accommodations, are certainly offered (albeit in an impersonal way), but when it comes to delivery, Iberia often seems to misplace its commitment. The process of getting a flight rebooked or a voucher for a meal voucher or hotel due to their delays feels like a quest for the Holy Grail, fraught with misinformation and runarounds.

Moreover, posts on an endless array of platforms reveal a chorus of dissatisfaction, a community of travelers united in their frustration with Iberia's service. From lost luggage to being stranded overnight without proper care, the stories are not just anecdotal but form a pattern of neglect that's hard to ignore. 

In essence, flying with Iberia feels like buying a ticket not just for a flight but for a masterclass in patience, resilience, and the art of dealing with disappointment. For an airline that boasts a legacy, one would expect a modicum of respect for its passengers, but instead, it offers a lesson in what not to do.

If you value your time, sanity, and the basic tenets of customer service, steer clear of Iberia. They've turned flying into an adventure, but not the kind anyone books a ticket for.

To clarify specific details:

Flight Delay and Missed Connection: My flight from Nice to Madrid was delayed, resulting in me missing my connecting flight to Miami. Despite sprinting through Madrid Barajas Airport, I arrived five minutes late. Unfortunately, there was no sympathy or assistance offered by the Iberia staff.
Rebooking Chaos: The rebooking process at Iberia's help desk was poorly managed and excessively lengthy. Only two employees were handling a long queue of passengers. Unexpectedly, without prior notice, these employees closed their operations, forcing us to relocate to another desk across the airport for assistance.
Hotel Voucher: I was rebooked on the following day's flight to Miami and provided with a hotel voucher. However, the accommodation was substandard, resembling a college dorm with a noticeable odor.
Further Delays in Madrid: On the next day, September 25, 2024, I arrived at Madrid airport for my 11:40 AM flight, only to find out it was delayed due to technical issues until 3:00 PM. After hours of waiting, this flight was eventually canceled.
Misinformation and Misrouting: I approached what I thought was an Iberia desk for help, but was redirected as they did not assist Iberia passengers. After traversing the airport again, I was rerouted via a complex itinerary: Madrid to London Heathrow, Heathrow to JFK, and finally JFK to Miami. Despite my inquiries about connection times, particularly at Heathrow, I was assured there would be sufficient time.
Stranded in Heathrow: Unfortunately, the time was insufficient, and I missed my connecting flight at Heathrow. This left me stranded at 7:00 PM without accommodation, luggage, or toiletries, and with no immediate solution for continuing my journey.
Last-Minute Arrangements: I contacted Iberia, and they could only arrange a flight with British Airways for the next day, requiring me to independently secure lodging for the night.
Service Comparison: While British Airways proved reliable, Iberia demonstrated severe operational and customer service deficiencies.
Luggage Issues: Upon finally arriving home, my luggage was lost for three days. Today, Iberia confirmed it was located in Madrid and is now en route to JFK, rather than directly to Miami, which seems unnecessarily convoluted.
Future Action: I plan to file complaints with the Department of Transportation and the Better Business Bureau. I strongly recommend that everyone avoid Iberia Airlines to prevent similar experiences."

Iberia doesn’t have their own lounge and I don’t think there is one for another oneworld airline so they direct their passengers to the Vienna lounge which was a fantastic lounge with a nice selection of both food and drink options that started with breakfast items when I arrived and transitioned to all day items around 11am. 
While the lounge was busy I found a nice spot by the window which had some great views of the airport and departing flights.

The flight left a little late maybe 20 minutes but wasn’t an issue for me as I didn’t have a connecting flight. I was in 1A which gives you better legroom as it is a bulkhead seat but like 99% of European business class on a narrowbody plane the seats are just economy with the middle seat blocked and in theory a better inflight experience than economy and that is exactly what this flight was. 

I had a nice three course meal with a choice of main courses and drinks and the crew were always seeing if anyone wanted anything. 

Overall the lounge experience was above what I was expecting and the flight pretty much what I was expecting so overall I was very pleased."

The Boston customer service agents were TERRIBLE. When we showed up at the airport they literally said they couldn't help us. It was unbelievably unprofessional  After insisting on speaking to a supervisor, we finally got transferred to an American Airlines flight via Philadelphia, only to learn that it was DELAYED and we would miss the flight to BCN.

RETURN LEG - Two days prior to the flight we went on the app to purchases seats. Only ONE of us was on the reservation. My husband's reservation had vanished into thin air. We called multiple times and got nowhere. When we got to BCN, we were referred to the Vueling  representative who told us they had no record of his reservation (nor of the seat I'd purchased).

2. They have so less seats in the premium economy that you can rarely sit together with your travel companion. During both flights we had to sit separately or pay on top to seat together! Like wtf ryanair is this?!

This was for just the outbound flight .... That is 3x the amount of money I paid for the entire roundtrip ticket. Paying extra for a flight change is a scam. Even though their policy says you can change your flight to any flight on Iberia.com, the only way to change it is over the phone with their customer service and according to """"their system"""" it only allows them to change to what is essentially a business class fare flight. 

When I inquired about whether there was a cancellation fee, they just went ahead and cancelled the flight. I never told them to cancel the flight. I called customer service so many times and they told me several different things. Because the flight had been cancelled, the reservation could not be changed. I was left with no flight tickets. I begged and begged the Iberia Twitter Business Account to help me and they told me someone would be calling me soon to resolve it. More than two days later, someone calls me. I speak with them for 13 minutes over the phone and all of a sudden, they hand up on me. I called that number back 2 times and of course it didn't work.

2. Gave me 1 hour to make a connection in Madrid, I just barely made it because I spoke Spanish to customs and they rushed me through. Dozens of people on my connecting flight did not make it, there were entire rows of seats empty because of this. Why even sell this as a connecting flight if it’s nearly impossible to make.

3. Because I had to rush through MAD I couldn’t buy food. No problem, my infotainment tells me I can buy food just ask the the stewardess, when I go up to her, she tells me this flight doesn’t sell food. So who’s lying her or the Ads on the screen in front of me. Later I see people have purchased the food I wanted. What a joke, I’m literally trying to give them money and they can’t be bothered.

Everyone got bread with their meal, me no bread.

Felt like racial discrimination but my evidence is all circumstantial.

I am writing to express my profound frustration and disappointment with the handling of my recent flight reservation. On August 7th, I received a confirmation for a flight from San Jose, Costa Rica, to Ibiza, Spain, scheduled for today, August 29th. The confirmation code for this reservation was K19HY.

Based on this confirmation, I proceeded to book an entire weekend itinerary in Ibiza, which amounted to approximately $10,000. As you can imagine, this was a significant investment, made with full confidence that my travel plans were secured by Delta Airlines.

However, when attempting to check in online for my flight today, I was informed by your support team that my reservation had been canceled. I was utterly shocked, as I had never requested any cancellation, nor was I informed that my credit card had not been charged. I have booked hundreds of flights in the past and have never encountered a situation where a confirmed reservation was not honored.

The lack of communication regarding the cancellation of my reservation is unacceptable. If there was an issue with the payment, I should have been notified immediately so that it could be rectified. Instead, I was left in the dark, and now that I am aware of the situation, all alternative flight options have been exhausted. 

As a result, I am now faced with the grim reality that my entire $10,000 itinerary in Ibiza is non-refundable, all due to the failure on Delta's part to properly manage and communicate the status of my reservation.

To add insult to injury, when I attempted to file a complaint on your website, I was unable to do so because I was not provided with a ticket number, which I should have received after the initial confirmation. The email you sent me clearly stated, """"La reserva se ha realizado correctamente,"""" with the confirmation code K19HY. There was no indication that my reservation was pending or required further action on my part, aside from a vague note in small font about confirming the ticket by a specific date.

Given the significant financial loss I have incurred due to this mishandling, I expect a full refund of my $10,000 expenses. This situation has not only caused me immense stress but has also severely damaged my trust in Delta Airlines as a reliable carrier.

I request that this matter be escalated immediately and resolved with the urgency it warrants. I look forward to your prompt response and an acceptable resolution to this matter.

This matter significantly impacted our long-awaited vacation. Our original flight plan for August 7, 2024, was from SeaTac to LAX on American Airlines, then LAX to Madrid on Iberia (IB42). We booked these flights early to save money. However, the flight schedule changed, resulting in an eight-hour layover at LAX. To avoid this, I contacted American Airlines, which rescheduled our flights to depart from SeaTac to Dallas (American Airlines(AA2769), then from Dallas to Madrid (Iberia IB42). During our flight from SeaTac to Dallas, we were informed that our connecting flight to Madrid had been canceled. Upon arrival at Dallas, there was no clear communication, and our luggage's status became uncertain. We were rebooked on a flight to Madrid the next day, but when we inquired about our luggage, we were assured that it would be on the flight with us. Despite these assurances, our AirTag tracker showed that our luggage was not on our flight. Upon arrival in Madrid on August 9, we immediately filed a lost luggage claim with Iberia, only to find that American Airlines still had our bags. We were told that our luggage would arrive the following day, but this did not happen. From August 8 to August 14, we waited for our luggage to be found, spending hours in the Iberia customer service line in Madrid. Despite providing AirTag information showing our luggage's location at American Airlines' luggage hold in Madrid, no one was able to retrieve it. The failure of both airlines to locate and deliver our luggage ruined our trip. We were without our clothes and essential items for an entire week due to poor management and inadequate customer service from both American Airlines and Iberia. We hope that by raising this issue, steps will be taken to improve the coordination and customer service between these airlines to prevent such experiences for other travelers."

Turns out we are not flying in and out of same terminal and wait for it, AA know nothing about any seats having been secured by Iberia and all seats are now gone.

I have traveled extensively on over 20 airlines over my life and Iberia Airlines Customer Service in the reservation process,  problem solving (when they made a mistake) and follow up is the worst I have ever experienced in my whole life.

1.  Iberia outsources ALL of their Customer Service (Booking and Iberia Plus) to a  firm in South America.  THEY DO NOT WORK FOR Iberia - so have zero ability to solve any problems or mistake made by Iberia.

2. Over these months, I have spoken to over 40 Iberia Customer Service Representatives and Supervisors and none of them are fluent in English - and speak with such a heavy accent them might as well be speaking Greek.  This made any conversation extremely difficult and prolonged (you have to speak to them very slowly and explain multiple times while it is almost impossible to understand their responses.

Background:

8 Months in advance, I attempted to book two Business Class Tickets using Avios Miles. I called the Iberia Plus Representative to book the flight and to confirm that 2 Business Class seats were available using points, as I had to transfer American Express Miles into my Iberia Account.  The Iberia Plus representative assured me that seats were available using Avios Miles.  I asked it they could hold those seats for 24 hours (American and other airlines do this) as I need to transfer the points.  He said they could not, but said the seats WE'RE AVAILABLE. I explained that once I transfer the points, they could not be transferred back, so I absolutely needed to confirm that the seats were available.  He said yes, so I transferred the points.

When I called back thenext morning, the Iberia Plus Representative told me the previous Representative had made a mistake and NO Business Class seats were available using Avios and never had been.  I was taken aback and spent the next two weeks and phone calls with multiple Supervisors explaining the situation and I just waisted 168,000 miles on the assurance of their employee.  

I spoke with several Supervisors and representatives (you have to repeat the whole facts each to you call as they will not transfer without knowing everything) asking them to solve the problem as these miles will be completely waisted. None of them could solve the problem.  Finally the only solution they provided is that I could transfer the Avios to another airline.

I ended up Buying two Business Class Tickets and then would then attempt to transfer the points to British Airways.

I logged in to my Iberia Plus account yesterday and tried to transfer the points, but it would only allow a transfer of 60,000 points and charged a fee of $50 so I called back to Iberia Plus and spent another hour with the representative explaining what had happened and what I was promised on the basis of the Iberia Rep's mistake.  The Rep told me there is nothing they can do. I asked to speak to a Supervisor and they said none was available, However they told me one would call me within the hour. My information was taken and I was told a Supervisor would call me back.  They never did.

I called again several hours later and was after a 30 min explanation I was transferred to a Supervisor and the line went dead (on purpose).  I called right back and had to spend another 30 min with the Rep explaining the situation. They finally transferred me to a supervisor and again the line went dead again (on purpose). I  called back a 3rd time and did the same 30 min explanation.  They said it was two hours to speak to a supervisor - I told them what had happened and they I would just stay on the line until one picked up.  After realizing I was not going to hang up, he spoke with a supervisor (the cowards would not get on the line) and they transferred all of my points.

I have a saying regarding Airlines.  If you put down the tray table and its not clean you wonder if they are servicing the engine.  If their customer service is representative of the way they manage their Airline - I have serious doubt about their safety. 

NEVER FLY THEM - It's a nightmare."

I travel four or five times a year for different purposes, Asia, Europe, North and South America included. My experience with Iberia has been one of the worst in my life as a regular traveler and here are some of the reasons:
-my flight on July 24th., was suddenly cancelled, passengers have passed immigration and security in Madrid airport, we were already onboard when all of a sudden we were asked to disembark due to some “technical problems”, that’s all we were told. After disembarking no one from the airline gave further details or reasons. When passengers asked, Iberia staff seemed very annoyed and just said that we will be arranged into the next available flight. Before boarding the new flight, after a wait of around two hours, it was announced that the aircraft had some problems (a joke) too and we were offered a hotel with no compensation for being cancelled twice.
-on my flight bounded for Madrid from Santiago de Chile, on August 15th., the cabin crew was so unpleasant and unprofessional that when several passengers complained about the foul smell of the lavatories and the lack of hygiene, they answered very rudely and their attitude towards us, the customers, was very bad. The cabin had trash everywhere, the smell of the toilets came up to the seats we were assigned to so we were unable to rest for the whole trip.

Plan to bring several LARGE water bottles because the flight attendants are NEVER going to come give you any. For the majority of the 7-hour flight, the flight crew remained behind the curtain in the far back, texting, eating, chatting.  They only came down the aisle with their cart TWICE throughout the entire flight -- once three hours in to give us a meal and the second time about 2/3 hours later for the breakfast meal. My husband and I bought a large water bottle with us on the flight but it ran out quickly.  We both had to walk up to the curtain, open it, and knock more than 6 times to ask for water, as did many other passengers.  All the crew did was give us one small cup, 3/4 of the way filled with water.  You would think that would be a sign that people are in need of water.  A couple of flight attendants did come down the aisles but they were JAUNING so we couldn't even catch their attention, nevermind put our waving hands back quick enough to not get hit by them.  I'm assuming they were rushing towards the front of the plane where first class was.  They never even looked at the passengers any time they came rushing out.  Also... space was so limited that it was extremely uncomfortable.  I did not see a single person in my area who did not need to get up multiple times to stretch.  Every time I went to use the bathroom I wished I could have just sat in there the entire flight because it would have been far more comfortable.  And you know how tiny those bathrooms are!  Finally, on one of my water trips I mentioned to the crew that another passenger had their window shade open at 1AM and the sun was directly in my eyes and in the eyes of an entire row of passengers.  One flight attendant waited about 7 minutes to come out and then quickly walked past the passenger and didn't even look at him.  The window remained open for the rest of the flight.

I look at the boarding it to look for the 4th time to see it’s at terminal M gate 28. I barley make my flight. Thinking the worst is over. Definitely was wrong. Finally back in Boston waiting for my luggage, standing for over an hour waiting with everyone that was on the flight with me. My luggage never came. And basically anyone who was making a connecting flight didn’t get their luggage. It’s almost midnight, I’m exhausted and just want to go home. I file my claim for my luggage, and go home. I called repeatedly the following day. I finally get ahold of someone, they tell me it will be at the airport by 10pm Tuesday night. I get and email today (Wednesday) and a verbal confirmation that it’s at Boston Logan. Drive an hour in traffic only to be told it’s not there. I am fuming at this point! So I call again, only to be told they scanned it but never actually put it on the plane. What in the actual F*#k! They guy from Iberia promised me that it will be there tomorrow but to keep calling. NEVER AGAIN WILL I EVER GIVE THIS AIRLINE BUSINESS, so people read the many complaints about this airline, spend the extra money on a more reputable airline."

We called the customer service line who then told us that we had to deal with it in the airport. So for fear of being stuck at the airport for 2 days, we have had to book an Air France flight to Paris. We have lost the first night at our hotel in the south of France, our Iberia tickets cost, we have to book a hotel In Paris for the night and they have basically ruined our vacation. Again, we were at the airport on time, we checked in on time, they just decided to sell more tickets than they had to maximize their profits with no regards for the customers. All the while being rude and not understanding. It’s no wonder Spain's economy is in such trouble given how their national airline does business .

The check-in and gate staff are third-party contractors. No one provided information about flight rescheduling, hotel stays or ground transport.

We then had to line up at Level departure windows, again for hours, to find out what hotel we were allowed to sleep in. The only alternative flight home we were offered was an indirect flight THREE DAYS later. Despite spending hours on the phone confirming our family had seats on this flight, at checkin we were told our six-year-old did not have a ticket (despite having a ticket number). The best we could do was a flight from Barcelona to LA. After the 12 hour fight with two small children, we had to rent a car and make the 6 hour drive home from Los Angeles to San Francisco starting at 8 PM.

I have done it again! I have traveled with Iberia airlines. Route Barcelona, Madrid/ Caracas and back Caracas/Madrid. What a horrific nightmare! Would I ever learn? But I swear this time,  never again!.  The story repeats… but you see the thing is Iberia does  offer good traveling schedules to Caracas. If you don’t want to fly direct to Caracas from Madrid  and arrive late in the evening, Iberia is your only choice. Plus let’s face it, Iberia  has been around for ages. And that is where I center my complaint or “review”. When you have been an airline of “larga trayectoria” (around for ages) and not always in the best of shape, you get complacent and perhaps also end up with old planes in your fleet. Now these old planes are perfectly functional. Some airlines even buy them to refurbish them like you would do to an old house and voilà, they are back in service as good as new. But it seems Iberia prefers to skip the extra cost of doing so and rather assign them to  routes where they know they have little competition. With the big players like Air France, Lufthansa, British Airways  and others gone out of the route Caracas/Madrid, Iberia is now king of these skies and, I suppose, it can afford to service this route with plain old planes.

Last June 29  on the scheduled flight Madrid/Caracas, carrying well over 100 passengers on the economic class,  3 hours on route and we are already with only 3 semi serviceable toilets in filthy state. The staff do warn you at the start of the flight not to wander into the business class toilets as a prelude for what they must know is coming. And no amount of complaining could persuade them to spruce them up, noticing that this is  “not their job”. Fair enough, these are already worn out toilets with stains and worn out seats, tape securing paper bins, lacking proper toilet paper as Ibearia prefers to offer kitchen towels for all your toilet necessities. I don’t blame the cabin staff really, they are only there to make the best of what Iberia has to offer. And please don’t get me started on the meals, not worth the paper to write on about it. My return to Madrid again on Iberia airline, was not different. Same story with the filthy old toilets and poor tasteless meals. On my return I decided to check if someone else has said anything or written any reviews. I also shared this experience with friends before deciding on writing a review myself. Regrettably, the general consensus is that the poor standards of Iberia airline spread across all their routes. I have not been on an Iberia flight for other international routes neither am I inclined to do so now. I have said at the beginning of this, I will not fly on Iberia again unless I hear they are willing to serve their clients on the South American routes with some dignified toilets and decent meals. I hope this time I keep my promise. 😝"

The website is useless when trying to local luggage. It doesn’t even tell you if your checked in luggage made it onto the plane! Turns out my luggage was left in UK… even though mine was checked in before a colleague I traveled with (who’s luggage arrived fine…)

The customer services phone person was useless & dismissive. What’s the point in having a dedicated lost luggage phone number if the person answering doesn’t have any access to a system to know if the luggage was put on the plane? And whose attitude is that they honestly couldn’t care less about your possessions going missing. 

Eventually we spent 3.5 hours in the Iberia customer service desk queue in Madrid airport. There were probably only 20 people ahead of us but again Iberia though it appropriate to only have 2 people on the desk (1 for business class & 1 for economy). By the time we got to the desk the queue was probably over 100 people. Only then did 2 more Iberia staff grace us with their presence. Although all they wanted to do was palm us off on a QR code online form (same thing they do at the desk but at the desk they can check what stay on the journey it’s at).

The seats were dingy and the seat in front of me was missing the pocket. There was absolutely no entertainment on this flight. None of the seats had a screen so therefore there was nothing to do for 11-12 hours. The air didn’t seem to work properly, as it was hot throughout the entire flight. With about 2 hours left, I heard a woman tell the flight attendant that the bathroom was out of toilet paper. His response to her: “We don’t have any more available”!!! How does an airline run out of toilet paper???!! The flight attendants were nice to talk to, but really didn’t do much. They were in the back eating and talking. When people went back to ask for water they would point to a bottle and wouldn’t move to assist! 
The flight home was a bit better. We had entertainment this time around. However, one bathroom did not have working water and another was not working at all. The air conditioning system was not that great on this flight either. 
In speaking with other passengers, they agreed on how terrible it was. One lady actually said “Iberia sucks!” But said that she flies with them, as they are the only direct flight to Spain. 
Iberia, do better for your passengers!!"

The staff who answer the phone at Iberia luggage department no nothing about anything. You cannot even get a manager on the phone, customers services just direct you back to the luggage department. My husband travelled Business class and the bags had priority labels. What a joke and a waste of money. 2 bags coming today by courier, only know that because I called the courier. The other bag coming separately why we don't know so its back to chasing and calling. No one from the airline has called us. Awful customer service, phones manned by robot type workers. Also the Iberia customer services phone number in the UK DOES NOT WORK HOW BAD IS THAT. if you have to fly with them make sure you put airbags in your luggage.

Barely had time to ask for anything and when I did they said what do you want? I am a Spanish speaker and in any language that is a very impolite way to treat someone. As if they were doing me a favor !!! I paid for my flight. I wasn't flying for free !!! Got to Madrid on my way back from Tangier to Miami then Orlando. Asked THREE passport check airport employees for directions to my next flight. All THREE gave me incorrect directions and kept ignoring me when I stated I was going to miss my flight, also the fact that I only had 40 mins between flights did not help since when i booked it I was not made aware that time moves forward one hour when leaving Tangier, Those employees would not even look at my boarding pass and of course I missed my flight. I understand it was not Iberias fault but I was in an unfamiliar and extremely large airport, so was a bit lost. Went to the Iberia customer service counter and joined the long line of passengers who had also missed their flights. Needless to say I was treated with very little empathy and with very short and dismissive attitudes. I guess depending on what nationality you are you are treated differently. I noticed that because even though I am a  US citizen the people next to me, who were also US citizens, were treated with respect and understanding, not that anyone is above another in any way due to what your citizenship is, but I surely felt a bit discriminated.
 The unwillingness to help and the continuous blaming made me very angry. Was told I had to pay an additional $200 euros to get on the next flight. Which I refused to pay. I preferred to pay the VIP lounge at the airport and the train ticket back to Orlando. Iberia will never get 1 cent of my money ever again. Finally after lashing out and asking to speak to a supervisor, which was non existent, an employee agreed to put me on the next flight which was at 11:40 am the next day. No fee. I did end up paying 120$ to stay at the VIP lounge at the airport to get some rest, which was ok with me. Also ended up paying for a train ticket from Miami to Orlando because Iberia refused to issue me a ticket back to Orlando. All good though because at least after some arguing I was put on the next flight to Miami which  I did appreciate. I was better off on the train anyways. Thankfully I made it home safely but definitely would not recommend this airline to anyone. STAY AWAY"

My son is on a Study Abroad trip right now in Spain and he landed in Spain on the 25th of June only to find out they left his bag back in Texas. As soon as he landed and his bag wasn’t at baggage claim, he tracked it back to the States. He went straight to their counter and they located it and said it would be put on the next flight and he would have it the next day. Next day rolled around and the next and he still didn’t have his bag. He called Iberia again and asked about his bag and let them know he would be flying to France for a couple of days and would pick it up when he flew back to Madrid. He got back and went to get his bag, they had sent it to Barcelona. 🤦🏻‍♀️ They said they would get his bag and have it sent to where he is currently studying and he would have it last weekend. It is now July 5th in the states and July 6th in Spain and he still doesn’t have his bag. 
He tried to file a reimbursement bag for everything he has had to replace while he has been waiting on his bag, and they said they would only reimburse him $20 out of the $1200 he’s had to spend on clothes, underwear, shoes, toiletries, chargers, etc. 
Keep in mind he’s a COLLEGE STUDENT who worked two jobs to pay for this trip. He bought clothes and everything he needed while in the states. Now he has had to buy more while he’s been over there and the airline won’t give him a straight answer and they haven’t gotten his bag to him when they said they would. Now he has to pay someone to take him 2 hours to the airport to get his bag and they’re only saying they’re going to give him $20.

Customer service is reluctant at best at this airline. Iberia offered the only non-stop flight from California to Spain and that was our sole selection criteria. We bought tickets four months in advance, but as flight time approached, Iberia reached out to offer a $481 travel voucher to change our travel dates when they realized the flight was in demand and they could sell our tickets for more. I frustratingly entered travel document info (passport number, frequent flier, etc) over thirty times into their reservation system and the info never registered. It required a two-hour call with customer service (almost impossible to reach) to have to input the same info another six times before it 'stuck'. My reservation never reflected on Iberia’s App that made me nervous. I had to continually input the record locator from the reservation for Iberia to find my booking. The 'add booking' function doesn't work on their app. Check-in is a brave new world. Iberia's app informed that my flight was available for check-in however my ticket was deemed “not eligible” for app check-in so I'd need to go to the airport check-in desk. If you don't go to the airport to check-in the day before, Iberia will void and resell your seats and you will need to BUY NEW tickets. I was able to ultimately check-in with my laptop over a land line from a hotel. Fortunately, I was aware of the Iberia check-in scam from other reviews so I carried my laptop for my three-week vacation otherwise our tickets would have been vacated by Iberia. They hold your feet to the fire to comply with their protocols, yet their antiquated and unreliable systems are frequently unavailable so it becomes a game of Russian roulette to comply. Need to go to the Iberia check-in desk to get your boarding passes? Well you best check their hours of operation; Iberia doesn’t have an open check-in desk, and they arrive late and leave early.  Iberia’s app only permits you to check in, if they determine that your ticket is “eligible”.  (No clue what eligibility criteria might be). Iberia is a horror show and an anxiety roller coaster."

I landed in Paris from MAD as a business class passenger with bags checked in a Priority. Only one luggage arrived. I filed a declaration of lost luggage, my bag was untracked, there was no trace of where it was. I made 7 calls to customer support, they were unable to tell me where the bag was, whether it had stayed in Madrid, had arrived to Paris. I received an SMS 10 hours after landing, informing me that my luggage was going to board flight VY 6937 from IBZ to ORY the next day.  (Vueling is Iberia's low cost airline).
The carelessness, unprofessionalism, cumulated mistakes and absolute incompetence across the board is like no other I have ever experienced. As a frequent traveler it's happened to me before that a piece of luggage doesnt make it. But this was just next level.

I recently had a deeply frustrating experience with Iberia Airlines regarding a change to my return flight reservation. Originally, my flight was scheduled to return from Rome to Santiago via Madrid. I attempted to change the origin of my return flight to Milan instead of Rome but faced significant difficulties on the company's website, which redirected me to a phone operator.

After spending several minutes on the phone, I was informed that I could change the origin of my return flight for an additional cost of approximately $500 per passenger. I accepted the charge for myself and my two children, assuming the matter was resolved. However, upon arrival at the airport, I was shocked to be told that I could not board the flight, though my children could. This situation was absurd and highly stressful.

At the check-in counter, I was instructed to call customer service because the staff at the counter could not assist me, causing further delays and frustration as other passengers waited to check in. During the phone call, I was informed that I needed to pay extra to secure my place on the flight from Milan, despite having already paid for the change. This made no sense, especially since my children and I were on the same reservation.

After an hour on the phone, I was finally offered a seat on the flight, but my return flight issue remained unresolved. As the departure time approached, I feared missing the flight altogether. Although I eventually boarded, I spent the entire journey anxious about not having a confirmed return flight.

From Spain, I had to make multiple calls to ensure that my return flight was confirmed. Despite assurances over the phone, I only received the tickets and reservation confirmation for my youngest child, not for myself or my older child. The stress and unpleasantness of this situation were overwhelming, especially when traveling with two young children.

I strongly urge Iberia to revise their policies to empower check-in counter staff to resolve such issues. Up until now, I was a satisfied customer who recommended Iberia to friends and family. However, after this experience, I will seriously reconsider flying with them again. I specifically chose a flexible flight option, which did not prove to be flexible in this case.

This experience was deeply disappointing and stressful. Iberia, please take note and improve your customer service and policies to prevent others from going through similar ordeals."

I am an avid Spain lover, especially of their people. I travel there at least once a year. I've mainly taken American or British. That's why going through the nightmare at the Madrid airline still scars me. The last time I took Iberia was something of a surreal, slow motion movie script that's impossible to believe.

My two minor children and I arrived at the Madrid airport and got into a check in line that stretched into eternity. At first it was steadily moving, as there were 3 attendants checking people in. Shortly, one attendant got up and left, leaving one attendant to attend to first and business class and the other all the rest. The line started moving significantly slower. After about 30 min, the second attendant gets up and leaves, leaving one attendant to check in about 30 more passengers. At this point we were moving at a snail's pace, and the boarding time starting to approach by the minute. There were still about 15 people in front of us and most with children and multiple bags to check in. All of a sudden, the last remaining attendant gets up, grabs her purse and starts to walk away. We are all in shock, running after her, explaining that we have to board and there is still a 30 min estimate time to get though security and switch terminals via a rail. She simply says, """"I got a call, I am needed elsewhere."""" She then walks away, leaving us stranded, at a loss, freaking out, as we are all about to miss our flights. Luckily a passenger began to frantically run around the airport calling for help. One random attendant came over to help us all with ticketing and baggage, but we all had to run to get to our flights and we barely made it. When we got into the plane I broke down in tears. This level of sheer insanity should never happen in a civilized society. My poor daughters were traumatized and shaken.

What for? So that Iberia can re-sell the 3 seats I've payed for with ~900€? What kind of company has a policy which charges 900€ for services that are not given to the customer? Especially considering that there are at least 25 days left until the flight and that the flight is in June so they'll have no problem re-booking it."

I told her that I had never heard such a thing in this small plane (I've been travelling for 33 years...), besides no one was using it so why can't I?
She just stood there saying I need to go all the way back to the economy class bathrooms, I was in shock, I was right there in front of COMPLETELY EMPTY BATHROOM, the door was even half open she could see no one was there! And told her I had jus woken up, had been sick, please let me use the bathroom, it's urgent. I used the word urgent and she just stood there, being completely rude.
I've gone through ALL Iberia's website, read """"our seats"""", """"terms and conditions of economy fare"""", all the """"Iberia Experience"""" tab and IT IS NOT STATED ANYWHERE THAT THE FRONT BATHROOM IS ONLY MEANT TO BE USED BY ECONOMY CLASS IN SHORT FLIGHTS.

If you absolutely have to travel Iberia, re-evaluate your life's choices.. but if you are going to go anyway, ensure you either book with them directly or validate your booking on their website, choose you seats on their website, etc. And don't fall for any BS answer they give you about booking outside of them directly.. they have a contract with these booking agencies to sell in their marketplace; if there's a problem, it's not only their fault, but something THEY NEED TO FIX with the agency, you are not at fault for using their marketplace that they contract for"

We booked business class seats a year in advance with the expectation that we would be able to modify/change our flights. I even checked the airlines policy on changing flights which stated 25 euros to modify. After booking we needed to get to our wedding location one day early, I called Iberia to change our flight and were told due to the fact that we booked through Iberia but were flying an American and British Airways flight that they could neither refund or change our flight. I have spoken with several customer service representatives at Iberia and a supervisor which have all been no help.  The supervisor then directed me to a claims departments which he  stated would add value with a voucher to rebook our flights. I'd also like to add that this suspervisor apologized for this incident and mentioned that there is nothing on the website that states you cannot change or refund a flight that is directed to a different airline under Oneworld. We even filed a complaint with the department through Iberia and were denied help through them as well. This is seriously the worst experience I've ever had/could imagine.

Bit worried at Granada when the seat issued for the Madrid-London leg was not the one paid for. Flight late leaving Granada and arrived at the most distant gate at T4. We then had to get to T4S in less than 40m. Mad rush through the terminal, endless retail obstructions, poor signage, got hot, sweaty, down to the crowded transit train, then rush up the other side to find the queue of queues for border control. By the time we'd got through that and rushed to the gate the flight had closed. Then had to queue again to get rebooked on a later flight. The booked months in advance emergency exit seat was gone of course and we had to sit in one of the most cramped seats ever. I have a knee prothesis and the knee was jammed up against the seat in front - two hours of agony. Throughout the Iberia staff were rude and unhelpful, with the shining exception of the connection desk clerk who was really good. The points that come to mind are:
1) If they can't be sure of the connection time, don't let customers book it.
2) Respect the seats booked - and paid for.
3) You know if the connection can be made before the origin flight leaves. Why not do the rebooking at the origin and save all the passenger pain later?
4) With tight connections other airlines I have flown with in the past have had a car waiting at the gate to run such passengers to the connecting aircraft gate.

We were not the only ones with connection problems; the Malaga flight was also affected, there must have been 10-12 of us. Clearly Iberia knew about the problem but did absolutely noting to mitigate it. What a shower. We will be avoiding Iberia in future and definitely avoiding Madrid for any connections - they might be upgrading it but clearly they have learnt nothing from decent airports like Changi and Dubai. And if you are tall or long legged the seat pitch is crippling - even Ryanair had more room.

I booked a separate flight from my friends. I arrived at Terminal D 2.5 hours before my flight, went to check-in and the gate agent said, """"Are you traveling standby?"""" I quickly informed him that I have a paid ticket for business class that I purchased in September 2023 through Ovago. I showed him the booking. He sends me down to a lady named Maria at the check in desk. Maria pressed buttons for 3 hours, and told me Iberia oversold the flight, but there are 3 seats in business with a """"R"""" meaning reserved. She said she could not put me in those seats. I asked why, she said they were purchased seats. 

At this point I have been standing with Maria for 1 hour and I am getting pretty upset, you have 3 seats, I am here to check in, but they wont give me my seat. Instead, I am scolded for not checking in """"online"""". I tried, but the Iberia system did not work, came up and said """"system error"""". 

At this point I am confident I will still get on my flight. So I called Iberia customer service, the agent on the phone kept telling me she could not help from afar, she did not have that reach. She can not see the seating chart, the gate agent is the only one that can get me on the flight. After 38 minutes of talking with Iberia I put Maria, my gate agent, on the phone with Iberia directly, after 20 minutes of talking with Maria, the Iberian representative hangs up on Maria. Maria hands my phone back to me, and rolls her eyes. 

My flight boards at 9:20, it takes off at 10:05. It is now around 9:40 and Maria tells me, I have your ticket for premium economy, you can take it if you want it, otherwise you will not be flying, and I am leaving.  My question from the beginning was, """"how much money will I get back on my ticket if I take this downgrade and board the plane?"""" Iberia rep on the phone, nor Maria could tell me if I would get anything in return. I have paid almost 5K for a business ticket, there is nothing wrong with my ticket per Iberia Customer Service, yet I do not have a seat because Iberia oversold their flight. Iberia will not admit to their fault. I was advised by Ovago that if I board the flight I would not get a refund, so I opted to walk away and miss the flight, assuming I would get another flight or refund at the worst.

One would assume they would offer a different flight on a different day, which is still really bad, but at least an option. Maria looked, no business class tickets available for the next 3 days on any flights to Malaga. She kept wanting me to take economy seats but would give me no confirmation of what refund I would get in return. Iberia would not put me in a hotel. Iberia ultimately made an error and would not own up and handle their business. 

I am very very angry and sad I missed my trip with family and friends who are waiting for me in Malaga right now.

When my husband came to occupy  seat 20 D, there was a  pool of water on the seat. He requested the flight attendant, whose name was Safaa. Z to get  some paper towels to wipe off the seat. She came after about 10 minutes and handed the paper towels to him. When he asked the seat to be cleaned up, she said she was not the cleaning crew and that he himself should clean up the seat.. We were incredulous and shocked because we had paid for the flight and she expected us to clean up the seat?!!  She steadfastly refused to clean the seat or have someone else do it, insisting my husband should do it himself!! we had never seen such atrocious , rude and arrogant behavior on any flight that we have traveled, and we are world travelers, and we are constantly traveling to different countries. This was the most horrible customer service that we have experienced on any flight! This particular flight attendant should NOT be on any flight because she has no customer service and no respect for anybody because the entire flight she was rude and arrogant to other passengers and totally unprofessional.

In the claim luggage area they gave us a paper form which needed to be filled  by hand and return to an agent of TSW ( I understand is the local handler). They said they where to put this info in the system and I was suposed to receive an email later that night. I am  Still waiting! 
We where very uneasy with the situation and my wife decided to go to the airport at 7 am. Talking to various people  she managed to locate one of my missing bags (which by the way wasn’t reported to me yet).
Later in the morning we received an email stating  that her luggage was to arrive in the 11 ok flight from Madrid.  We rushed back to the airport and to our surprise my wife’s luggage lock was broken and the suit case open.  My wife is very organized and packs with great care she packs in cloth bags and such, the suit case was all messed up inside and found that the 3 pairs of Chanel shoes , one cashmere/mink poncho a Gucci belt and some other fine clothes where missing. This people must have seen through the x ray machine the metal buckles of shoes and belt and decide to raid the suitcase. Don’t know either if the luggage was left in Madrid  on purpose?? The Suit case lock  was broken making the suitcase no longer usable.we estimate  more than$ 8kin value where lost. We are still missing one bag! 
The lady’s in the counter where really nice and helpful but with no authority on the matter and  unable to help other than recomending to call the airline. 
 There is no one to talk to from the airline. I really hope that Iberia covers the damage as the luggage was under their care the hole time.
My wife si an executive platinum emerald member in American airline one world program. We where traveling in business class and our luggage tagged as priority? 
I don’t understand what that means anymore. 
Shame on Iberia and its customer service, I would not recommend any body checking luggage with them and never to leave garments that can be identified  in the x ray machine. Iberia it’s  a one world alliance member and one would expect better customer service.

I was able to get a ticket and board the flight from ORD to MAD. Although I had to explain my ADA service dog status to the airline. 

In MAD, I had to exit the airport after stopping twice at Iberia service desks asking for the ticket for my next connecting flight, as they would only give me a ticket at ORD for the first flight. There are no service dog relief areas in Spain’s airports, so I had to eventually go outside for my dog.  I eventually ended up re-entering the airport and running between Iberia snd American desks because neither seemed to be coordinating information-I couldn’t get a ticket on the correct flight, nor get my checked bag on the flight I was ticketed standby on nothing.  Once past security, I found an Iberia help desk and was given a ticket on a flight.  

After we boarded, we deplaned because of a problem with the plane.  We by a stroke of luck left on another plane from a different gate about an hour late. 

This brings me to my return trip from. AGP-MAD-ORD.  I confirmed my service dog with American. American changed my departure date to a day earlier, as I would have 50 minutes between landing and my next flight departing, which is impossible to do.  So I booked a room in Madrid.  

When I arrived 3 hrs early, I stood in line until 1.5 hrs before the flight left to get my first ticket.  Then, I was told that Iberi a would not give me a ticket because there was no record of a service animal.  I pointed out that I travelled to Spain without a problem. I produced the Iberia form and American information showing I had gone through the process to bring the dog, but 3 agents said no.  If the dog isn’t on my reservation. I could not go.  They wrote a phone number for Iberia Reservations on a baggage tag and told me to call them. They also made clear that I could not fly without giving at least 49 hours notice of my service animal. (Side note, for the trip home, I had secured a EU Pet Passport noting my service animal.)

Iberia’s reservation line told me the error was on American’s part, as they had no record of a service dog on my trip at all.  I again pointed out that I traveled to Spain on the same reservation without a problem.  They refused to do anything to assist me, so I called American.  They also informed me of needing to notify them 48 hours minimum in advance of a flight that I’d be traveling with a service animal, which I told them I did the same day or day after I booked the trip months ago. 

After spending 11:30am-7:30pm on the phone with both airlines, the best solution American could provide (because I eria can’t get their computer system to add a service animal in their reservation or ticketing system) was to forward me all of the emails between the two airlines confirming my service dog on all of the flights I had either been on been ticketed on.  

So, I am left in Malaga for 2 more days to hope that by some miracle I get tickets at both airports and travel home with my service dog if the agents at the airport decide to accept the emails as proof that I should indeed be allowed to fly home with my animal.  Honestly, I don’t have high hopes of returning home as American and Iberia Special  Assistance departments promised me tonight.  

I never would have dreamed getting home would be such a challenge.  I mean, I have documentation from vets in the US and Spain , USDA certification, ADA certification, original rabies documentation, and  the Iberia and American Service dog forms/documentation. Not to mention my dog is perfectly behaved and working while other dogs bark at him and people try to distract him because they want to pet him."

However, I must express my dissatisfaction with the purchasing process, which I find to be one of the most peculiar and unprofessional practices I've encountered from an airline company.

As someone who frequently purchases flight tickets, I have never experienced a system where direct purchase is not an option. Instead, this airline reserves the ticket and deducts €10 from your account, only refunding it if you choose not to proceed with the purchase. If I intended to make a reservation, I would have done so directly without this unnecessary step. I voiced my concerns, yet they refused to refund my money. If €10 is crucial to you, then by all means, keep it. However, I have decided I will not fly with this airline again.

Furthermore, I was surprised to discover that I had inadvertently paid for baggage on my return ticket. I assumed it covered both legs of the journey. Who charges baggage fees separately for a return trip? As a result, I traveled without luggage, only to realize I had 20 kilograms allocated for my return journey. This practice is highly irregular and indicative of the airline's questionable practices.

In Rome, the Iberia airline ticket clerk didn't give us a boarding pass for the second leg of our flight (Barcelona -Boston) and said to get it at the gate in Barcelona. We thought it was strange, but we shrugged it off. In Barcelona we were at the counter 1 hour 15 min before boarding time, there was nobody there. We asked the counter next to it, they said to wait and we will be given the boarding pass. Passengers were starting to gather, but nobody was there. We are used to the American way, which is very organized, to start calling out if anybody needs a boarding pass etc. Nothing happened, no announcements were made. They were on their phones, coming and going, laughing or chatting and not working, after being there late, only 10 min before boarding time. At last, way later than boarding time we shouted from behind the ropes that we need a boarding pass, they let us in (at that point there was chaos, passengers needed different things and nobody was paying attention to them. The boarding time has passed and no workers did anything. When we reached the worker, she said we are late and they sold our tickets to somebody else. There were 4 of us, and they didn't give us anything, no accommodations for the night, no ticket for the next flight, nothing! We had to go find a hotel and book new airline tickets for 4 people.  That was the worst flight of our lives, we were never treated like this and we will definitely never use them again.  The tickets were most likely sold even before we flew to Barcelona, that's why the clerk wouldn't give us the boarding pass and just shipped us off for somebody else to deal with it. We asked for reimbursement but nobody were told they couldn't do anything. We stayed in Barcelona without luggage, because those flew to Boston without us. Worst airline, worst flight! Stay away!"

You need to book well ahead, as the flights are often full.

About 20 minutes before departure, business class pax are called through to the tiny (standing room only) gate area, then everyone else crowds in. A few minutes later, the doors open and everyone follows the short, outside covered walkway to board the aircraft. The journey is on a smaller (2 + 2 configuration) Air Nostrum aircraft and the website guidelines on carry on are a bit confusing. Basically, you get the standard allowance but you are given a tag to attach to any larger bags (anything over 8 kg and 45 x 35 x 20 cm), which you drop at the foot of the aircraft steps as you board. At Madrid, the bags are offloaded before you disembark and are left for you to collect at the bottom of the aircraft steps. The seats were comfy enough for the brief flight – so short that the crew do a drink service in business class (I don’t think business class is worth the extra money on this particular flight)."

10.4461984634399,5.75055980682373,"Lost Luggage Refunds",1,"Ah the saga of my lost carry-on bag. Where do I begin? I'm in my 40's and have flown many times to Europe since I was 20 years old and this was the FIRST time an airline had lost my luggage. I partially blame the ginormous unorganized Madrid (MAD) airport as well. 

I had a carry-on that I was forced to put under the plane in Florence by an already horribly rude lady at 4 in the morning. My route was Florence > Madrid > LAX. It was December 1st 2023. From Florence my mom and I flew with Vueling, we landed in Madrid which we had about a 2 hour layover and then finally landing into LAX, that's when this whole nightmare began. The flight was actually delayed about an hour and then later I found that my carry-on never made it home, but my mom's did. It was still at the Madrid airport.

Let me preface this by saying that I have an air tag which is what saved my sanity and gave me peace of mind. I HIGHLY recommend buying them. So when I finally realize my bag wasn't coming at baggage claim (along with a whole bunch of other people I might add), I file a claim with the Iberian rep LAX guy and from that day forward begin the MANY calls to the Iberia lost baggage customer service people (1-800-772-4642) which I called EVERY DAY, sometimes twice. Once in the morning and once at night. Reading other reviews though, nobody blatantly hung up on me. But they sometimes tried to rush me off the phone after telling me they had no information regarding my claim. It really depends on who you get honestly. Some seem like they know what they're talking about and some don't realize where they are lol. Some did lie to me too telling me at one point they did locate the bag and was waiting for flight info and then the next day saying they hadn't located it and were still searching which definitely angered me and put me on an emotional roller coaster. 

NOBODY knew where the bag was but I did, thanks again to my air tag. I had to tell them exactly where so they could email that info to MAD airport. It was so frustrating seeing exactly where it was which was Terminal 4 (baggage claim) and not being able to just go there and grab it myself. Apparently when you call customer service, they have NO way of communicating to the airport via phone which I thought was crazy and ridiculous. I've never heard of a business that didn't have a higher person you could complain to, let alone a department. Only emails which the airport never responded to, let alone me who desperately tried emailing on my own as well. I took screenshots of the air tag locations, sent them pictures of what the suitcase looked like and literally pleaded with them to please help me. Nobody responded. At one point on a customer service call I was so fed up, tried asking for a supervisor and they ignored my request and kept trying to tell me they were still searching for the bag and there was nothing they could do. This whole experience was so WTF??? I mean I know here in the states for the most part, there's good and bad customer service BUT at least there's a higher up or a supervisor you can try to talk to. Over in Europe I feel like nobody cared and there wasn't a person there to actually take charge and get sh*t done! I really felt powerless that they had my property and I couldn't do anything about it while taking their sweet old time. Even if I threatened to sue which I didn't but was wanting to, they seemed to want to take a siesta first then still not want to help me or take me seriously. The bureaucracy with dealing with a foreign country is something I hope to never have to experience again. Nobody wanted to work and again they did not care. I feel the airport could of also communicated better. They really have to figure out some way to communicate together because their system clearly does not work at all. One of the customer service people did admit that and agree with me as well. It was really unprofessional and there was no accountability at all. I felt like they could do anything they wanted and it didn't matter because their supervisor was probably the same way. I hate to say it but at this point I felt like it was personal seeing I was American which I gathered from other reviews I read on here too. 

THEN after a couple of weeks still calling and them saying they were still trying to find the suitcase, they tell me they're now putting in a special search team to as a special investigation to the matter. I was like just NOW you're going to do this? Sure whatever. So they make another special claim and email me asking what they would find inside if they scanned it for items to make sure it was my bag once they found it. 

Weeks later, nothing again so I keep emailing them screenshots because at this point it has been moving around the airport so SOMEBODY'S been in contact with it and you would think they would at least read my tag on the bag and put two and two together? I see it move to the front of the airport so I think hmmm maybe they did locate it and scanned it as TSA because TSA is at the front of the airport right? Then it's moved back to the middle of the airport. All this time they still don't know where it is because the airport isn't responding back to the Iberia customer service people. 

THEN there's movement. Next thing I know, it's flown to a Barcelona Airport. Like HUH? Ok ...so I think they're going to fly it back from to me from there? I check the flights and there's one the next day going to LAX. I pray that they do that and even call customer service to ask them about it but they have no idea of course and I was like OMG can't someone just communicate something? THEN I see they fly it to the OTHER Barcelona airport nearby.... I was like WHAT? WHY?! THEN a couple days later to some air cargo facility called WFS which stands for Worldwide Flight services which is a third party air transit company that is a part of the airport? At this point I had been trying to call the WFS place AND the lost and found at the Barcelona (BCN) airport and emailing them but of course nobody answers the calls and the recording hangs up on me and nobody answers my emails. At this point it's now almost the middle of December and it totally takes me out of the Christmas spirit. I'm so sad and heartbroken thinking I'll probably never get it back. There were things in there that were irreplaceable and special to me. 

THEN a week later I see it going back to the Barcelona airport then days later back again to the Madrid airport so I call and they say it's finally going on a flight to LAX on New Year's Eve! I actually didn't believe it though because I'd been lied to so many times but I was still trying to be positive and hoping for the best and  guess what, it didn't make the flight lol. Apparently the engineer decided they didn't have room for my bag for the flight. Like I've been waiting a month now and I should have priority at this point but again, THEY DO NOT CARE. So I google to see when the next flight is and it's January 3rd 2024. So I wait and pray it gets on that flight. Now the thing with the air tag is that it needs to be around other apple products for it to ping it's location and early that Wednesday, at 2:35am, it hadn't refreshed or pinged the whole day still showing it was at the Madrid airport but that's only because it actually was on flight IB 6171. Reason being it was down under the plane and everyone's phone was on airplane mode. If it were still at the airport, there would of been activity at some point for it to ping and refresh. So when the plane landed at 3:51 pm at LAX, it refreshed and thank god it was finally here, a MONTH AND THREE DAYS LATER. It MOST DEFINITELY shouldn't of taken that long. People here complaining about 3 days... I only WISH it took that long in my case but unfortunately it did not. Just ridiculous.

I had told the guy who took my claim initially to have it delivered to my house once they found it but now that it was finally home, I just decided to go to LAX last minute after work since it was so close to me and try to just get it myself. After talking to some people I went upstairs to the Iberia check in area at the airport and nobody was there so I had to ask Air France next door to go knock on the door and have one of them come out. A lady did and I explained my situation and she took the original claim form and went back to look for my bag. 10 minutes later, she comes out with no bag saying it wasn't there. She said I'd have to wait for 20 minutes for some guy at baggage claim. I was like look, the bag looks like THIS and showed her a pic. She said """"Oh there was something like that back there but it didn't match up to your luggage tag"""" which I thought she meant name tag... but she took a pic of it on her phone and went back again to check again. 5 minutes later she FINALLY rolls out my bag and she still doesn't believe it's my bag. She asks me to open the combination lock as proof. Also my NAMETAG is still attached with my name and all information CLEARLY written on there. The bag opens of course and I tell her didn't you even see my nametag and match it up with the claim form I gave you? She didn't even bother to look anywhere else because that would require more work I guess to look at it and then when she realized she had made a mistake proceeded to tell me that she only scanned the luggage tag because that's all that really mattered. At this point though the original tag was covered with 10 other luggage tags because it had moved all over the place so of course it wasn't going to match up seeing nobody communicates and there wasn't any record of anything! If I didn't even show her a picture of what the suitcase looked like, who knows if I'd even have it right now. These people really have no common sense like AT ALL!!! Or do they care. Even when I finally got my suitcase back, she didn't even seem happy for me which I don't need her to jump up and down but I don't know, pretend you care at all? Especially if it was their fault. I had been waiting over a month to get it back wasting all my time and energy everyday which should of never happened in the first place. Also I asked what the procedure was if they still had to deliver it to my house and she said it would of taken 24 hours and after that I'd have to be present to sign for it and show ID which who knows if I would of been at work because I didn't trust any of them at this point seeing again I went straight to LAX to get it done once and for all. So glad I did that.

Anyways, sorry I didn't mean to write a novel BUT what I learned from this whole horrible ordeal is to BE PATIENT because I didn't lose my temper the whole time also with them on the phone only because I felt that if I yelled or cursed, it would give them a reason to hang up on me and would only worsen the situation, and keep calling and don't let them forget about you. Persist EVERY DAY because they WILL get tired of you and eventually do their job AND BUY AN AIR TAG! Or some type of tracker because I feel like that's really the thing that gave me peace of mind in being positive and information on where my bag was. Even if it's not accurate at times, ANY information is better than nothing at all. I never asked for any compensation either because I read on other reviews that even if you were promised any, it would take months if at all. I was so sick and tired of having to deal with these people that I just want to put all this behind me seeing I finally got my luggage back. And thankfully it was all in one piece too with no damage which was a surprise honestly. If I didn't, then of course I would have to be dealing with that right now. Plus I threw all my receipts away in Italy thinking I didn't need them anymore so I'm sure they would of asked for them and I don't want to give them anymore of my time and energy. Anyways, after this I will MOST DEFINITELY NOT BE flying with Iberia Airlines ever again even if I have to pay a million times more. The energy spent with worry and heartache is something I never want to deal with ever again if I could avoid it. Iberia's whole system is broken with no protocol or structure. Their practices are very illegal and abusive even seeing what others have written. They have over 6,000 1 star reviews on here and only over 3,000 5 star ones so that should definitely tell you that they need to either clean up their act or just go out of business because this irresponsible attitude and bad/rude customer service along with the amount of lost baggage on the daily can't last forever and shouldn't be tolerated AT ALL!!!!!

I just got a response back yesterday from Barcelona (BCN) airport from a December 18th email I sent, one of many  (note that it's about a half month later) and they responded with (and I'm paraphrasing), """"Sorry, we don't know where your suitcase is and also this isn't the right department anyways for your problem."""" And that was it... no, """"Oh but here's who you can contact... """" OR """"I'll forward this email though to the right department""""....They don't care...or even realize I finally got my suitcase back... so yeah... the whole system there is broken for sure."

It would have been easy to resolve the problem when I was in Spain for ten days. However, the responses from the Iberia employees were always poor or none at all, not to mention the rudeness of the employees in Spain (Madrid and Barcelona Airports). I kept calling Iberia at the number 1(800) 772-4642; when following the robot's instructions - lost luggage - sometimes, the system transferred me to a human. They constantly say this is different than the correct number and offer other numbers, which either don't work or are in Spain. International calls to Spain are expensive. I was in Barcelona (3 days), and they told me that the lung was in Madrid. When I was in Madrid for three days, they told me the suitcase was in Barcelona.

In agreement with the Montreal Treaty, Iberia paid me $ 1638.66. 
At least they paid me for the loss, although nothing will blow the lousy experience off my mind. I recommend you not travel with a cabin bag in Iberia or put on a tracker because Iberia staff cannot track luggage.

- We called the airlines a day before our flight, and requested a bassinet for the baby. They ensured me that the baby will get a bassinet and assigned me a seat next to it. This was better than American Airlines as they could not ensure bassinet until I was inside the aircraft. It is much less stress when you know for sure that you will get a bassinet.

I usually don't have interest or time to write reviews but this time.... It's needed. The overall incompetence trying to book my flight was hard to believe. It all started a month ago when I booked a flight for me and my son to go from LAX to 
Barcelona. When I showed up at LAX, they told me they cancelled my son's flight because they didn't have his passport information. This was news to me, because no one ever called me or emailed me saying they were missing information. When I called them from the airport it took them 1 hour to tell me the flight was full and it took another hour to book us another flight the same day at America Airlines. After 1.5 hours on the phone booking the new flight, we completed the process, I paid, they said they would call me with the confirmation number, but they never did.
When i called again asking for the details to board the plane, they informed me that I didn't have a reservation and now it was too late to get on that plane. I couldn't believe it, because the charge went through. I proceeded to then blood the next flight which was the next day and trying to tell then that they had already charge me, they didn't care and charge me again, stating (you will be reimbursed for sure)  but since they took to long in the system, i lost that flight too, and ended up booking 2 days later. After all this frustration (now I've been in the airport for 5 hrs trying to book a flight with a 13 yo boy who is tired, hungry and frustrated....
They assure me that it is all taken care of, for BOTH of us to fly 2 days later, that they will email me details.... When I come home at 11.30 pm, tired and ready to sleep... I check the next the day my reservation and they messed it up AGAIN!
They had me flying 12/21 from LAX to Madrid... and wait.... then flying the next day from LAX to Barcelona !!!  I don't know if they are of very limited capacity of if they have very little training as they put me on hold multiple times after every little question, making each phone call about 1 hr. 
Now I have to spend a few hours to fix the problem again, and then get the refund of the double charge. What a nightmare! 
Update. now that I fixed the problem, i check my email and the reservations are both under my son's name, i have to call them again to fix that because at this point I DONT TRUST what they tell me, i want it in writing, i don't want to risk losing my flight yet again! 
I hope the airline sees this and invests some money on properly training their staff or firing the people who are evidently incompetent. I know Spanish people to be very smart and efficient in general, they may just be lacking training. I don't know, but for sure I WILL NEVER FLY WITH Iberia AGAIN IF I CAN AVOID IT."

December 10:
Iberia lost over 20 passengers' luggage, including one belonging to my stepmother, containing various items intended for Christmas. The magnitude of this incident suggests a severe lapse in the airline's luggage handling procedures. I find it perplexing that a plane can depart with missing luggage, and I strongly believe that modern technology could prevent such occurrences. Simple measures, like scanning each piece of luggage before departure, could ensure that no item is left behind and certainly not 20 pieces.

I learnt from another reviewer that Iberia also lost more than 40 pieces of luggage on another flight, also going through Madrid.

December 11:
During a call with customer service to seek clarification, we received verbal confirmation that our delayed luggage had been found, but when politely requesting them to please send a written confirmation, the representative abruptly closed the line. This disrespectful treatment of customers only adds to the overall negative experience.

December 12 Update:
Contacting Iberia again, this time with Carlos, we learned that the company policy prohibits providing written confirmation, and he declined to escalate the case. Carlos mentioned a potential 24-hour delay in updating the status of our luggage. This unwavering adherence to withholding written confirmations, coupled with a refusal to escalate, intensifies our concerns about transparency and accountability, further eroding our trust in the company.

In conclusion, the numerous setbacks, unprofessional conduct, and lack of transparency have significantly marred our experience with Iberia. I sincerely hope for a swift resolution and improved communication, but the sentiment is pointing in another direction."

In flying with them round trip from Boston, MA (USA) to Bologna, Italy, I experienced nearly every imagineable flight issue, as well as some which I could not have imagined prior. My flight from Boston was delayed due to weather (not Iberia's fault), but throughout the delay, no information on departure time was communicated to the passengers at the gate. When I landed in Barcelona, Spain, the first of two connecting stops, it was too late to make it to my first connecting flight. Having missed this flight, I went to an Iberia gate where there was another flight to my second connecting stop (Madrid, Spain), which was scheduled to leave in approximately 45 minutes. After waiting for the ticketed passengers to board, the staff at the gate gave no clear indication of how to proceed, but waved me onto the plane without even issuing a formal ticket. This flight landed in Madrid with enough time for me to make my original second connection. However, I was not allowed to board the flight as the gate staff told me that I had been bumped due to the flight being overbooked. After debating with the staff to no avail, I waited in line for two hours to speak to a customer service representaitive to be told that I could join the standby queue for an evening flight to Bologna, and that if there was no room on that flight, I'd be given a hotel voucher and the option to take a flight the following morning. I waited for five additional hours in the airport until the evening flight began to board, a process which started an hour after it was scheduled to, and was ultimately not allowed to board the standby flight. When I went to speak to customer service to get the hotel voucher and a ticket for a morning flight, I was told that I would not be given a hotel voucher, despite having been stranded by the airline at the Madrid airport at what was now just after midnight. The customer service representative also told me that I could not get a morning flight to Bologna, and that my only option was to fly to Venice, from where I'd need to rebook my transfer to the Ravenna cruise terminal (my ultimate destination). With this being my best option, I accepted, but was unable to find a hotel with vacancy and was forced to spend the night in the Madrid airport. My morning flight was relatively uneventful, but after my flight ordeal, Iberia refused to compensate me for my Bologna accommodations, original transfer from Bologna to Ravenna, or rebooked transfer from Venice to Ravenna. I hoped that the worst had passed when I began my return journey, but it had unfortunately only just begun. My flight from Bologna to Madrid was delayed by almost an hour, with all passengers already on the aircraft, and water was only distributed in small cups after 45 minutes with no air conditioning active. When I landed in Madrid, I had to full-on sprint over half the length of the terminal to make it to my first connecting flight, where I was told that I had to check my carry-on bag due to my late arrival. I reluctantly agreed, relieved to have at least made my connection, but when I would finally arrive in Boston, my bag had been lost. I submitted a claim for a lost bag, but when Iberia delivered my bag to me several days later, it was the wrong bag, despite Iberia having been given a description of my bag. After countless calls with Iberia throughout the following weeks and multiple trips to the Boston airport to try and speak with the baggage company that Iberia outsources their operations to, I finally received my bag after two weeks. A pair of shoes inside the bag had been damaged beyond repair, and despite four months of email and phone follow ups, I was declined reimbursement (of less than $50 USD total) for the expenses I incurred in retrieving my lost bag. I was never compensated for the night I spent in Madrid, my damaged shoes, parking expenses at the airport when attempting to retrieve my bag, or any other costs due to the entire experience. I will never fly with Iberia again, and encourage anyone who considers flying with them to reconsider."

I filled out all the appropriate forms and Iberia stated that once my bag was located they would fly it to Rome and have a courier deliver it to the apartment I had rented.

After hours on the phone, a resolution was finally reached: a rescheduled flight on September 26th, complete with an extensive 12-hour layover in MAD, and arrival in BER on September 27th at 11 PM, effectively almost September 28th. In essence, I reached my final destination nearly three days later than my originally scheduled arrival.

Understandably, I submitted a formal complaint, only to be met with a response from Iberia that left me utterly dismayed: """"There is nothing we can do for you. Thank you for your understanding."""" This response raised a multitude of questions. Who would compensate me for the considerable time lost, the stress, anxiety, frustration, the financial burden, and the loss of working days? I was even forced to consume unplanned vacation days from my limited remaining annual leave. All of this turmoil was the direct result of a system error, which is especially disheartening considering my decade-long loyalty as a customer of Iberia. I've consistently chosen Iberia for my flight bookings, and this is the treatment I receive?

I'd like to conclude by expressing the gravity of the situation I found myself in. I wouldn't wish this kind of experience on anyone. The fear and uncertainty of being stranded in a foreign country, far from your place of residence, with no knowledge of when you can return home, is an unimaginable burden. It becomes even more daunting when you have responsibilities to take care where you live and your hands are tied. Fortunately, I had family in CCS who were able to assist me, but the situation could have been far more dire in a foreign land where you know no one. Once again, my profound disappointment in Iberia's handling of this situation is overwhelming."

We asked how that could be since we were already checked in, got our boarding passes etc., but received no understandable explanation. We panicked and called our contact person at the travel agency, who wanted to talk to the flight attendant of Iberia in person, but the flight attendant refused to talk to her and sent us away. The travel agency said it was clearly the fault of Iberia that we didn't get a correct ticket number and that they simply had to let us board the flight. Anyways, they wouldn't let us board, we therefore also missed our connecting flight. We went to the Iberia counter and asked if they could set us up with another flight etc., but they said it wasn't their fault, they refused to talk to us any further and denied us any service and help altogether.

I am utterly disgusted by the abysmal service provided by Iberia. The entire experience has been nothing short of a nightmarish ordeal that I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy.

To begin with, the communication was nothing but a pathetic display of incompetence, leaving me clueless and frustrated. But the real horror began when I realized that my luggage had been lost. It's simply infuriating that a company of this stature can't handle something as basic as safeguarding passengers' luggage.

What followed was a wretched scavenger hunt in Fuerteventura, where I had to waste half a day of my vacation scrambling to find essential items in a nearby town due to the scarce options available where I was stationed. This inconvenience forced me to incur astronomical costs, the majority of which Iberia has audaciously refused to reimburse adequately.

Their pitiful compensation is nothing but a cruel joke. Offering a measly sum that barely covers the cost of a swimsuit, while I have lost valuable time and money, is an insult to injury. Iberia seems to have no semblance of respect or concern for their customers, leaving them in a perpetual state of uncertainty and distress without a shred of empathy or responsibility.

To add salt to the wound, the uncertainty surrounding the return of my luggage pushed me to possibly buy more than needed, with the threat of having to repeatedly travel to get necessities looming over me due to the unclear timelines given by others who were also at the mercy of Iberia's inefficiency.

I vehemently warn anyone considering flying with Iberia to think again. This experience has been a hellish journey through neglect, sheer incompetence, and a heartless disregard for customer satisfaction and well-being. Save yourself the agony and choose any other airline, because Iberia clearly doesn't give a damn about you or your belongings."

We are also 2 black girls ( you will see the relevance of this as you read on). We had the worst experience ever with Iberia with a taste of racism. The customer service is the worst I have ever experienced in my whole entire life. In short, we upgraded to business class, and paid the full amount using my card. But once we arrived at the business checking point, we were told that we could not board business even though we paid and they actually took the money from my account. They said business class is full and  it’s no refund. For more details and for how we felt discriminated against as black girls, please read the full story below:

 Let me explain in details what happened: My sister and I upgraded to  2  business class tickets on a flight from Spain to the US (Washington DC). I paid with my card. I had a confirmation email with flight information. They even took the money out of my account almost immediately. So then, the day of the flight, we went to check in in the business line. The ticketing agent was rude to begin with. How was she rude? As soon as we came up to her counter: she said: “ you are not business class, you are economy. We replied: yes, we are business class because we paid for it”. She told us that all the seats in business class were full. And then we said: we booked and paid in full for business class and then we showed her our confirmation email and flight info. And we added: “On top of that the money is gone from my account already and how come they took my money and overbooked the business class”. She said: “I don’t know I can’t help you with that because it’s my time to take launch. I have to go”. And then, she walked away from us and left us standing there with no one to help us. Her colleagues did not pay us any attention. We looked around and saw the customer service desk and we went to the desk behind us. We stood in line for approximately 1 hour before we were able to talk to someone at the customer service counter. Mind you, our boarding time was approaching. We were anxious. 

Remember, we are 2 black girls in line and I counted 8 white folks in the same line. Please, tell me why the white lady at the customer service counter, got out of her seat and approached my sister and I who are two black girls and said; “this is not economy line. This is business line. The economy line is towards the back, please. You must go there to be served”. Let’s talk about this: there were 8 white people in line. Why did she not tell them the same thing? Why did she choose us, 2 black girls to say this to? There were white folks in front of us and behind us. When I  replied: “We are in the right line Madam”. She looked at us and asked: but this is business class: “are you business class”? I nicely said “yes”. But I was boiling inside 😡. 

When it was  finally our turn, the lady at customer service told us that we couldn’t get our money back nor could we get on business because it’s full. At this point we were frustrated. I had paid for international phone service so I had good connection so I called my bank. My bank told me they could not cancel the transaction and that I had to cancel it from Iberia. Basically, they took our money and did not let us book on business class nor did they refund our money. they said these exact words: “business class is full and we cannot refund you the money”! That’s not all! Wait for it. Keep reading. I promise, it’s almost done! 

So now, we were given seats in economy after paying for business class and not being refunded. In addition, they refused to check in our bags unless we paid extra. Mind you, business class comes with 4 check bags for 2 people. So now after paying for business class, not only we are being told that we can’t get business class because it’s full, we have to go to economy, but also we can’t check in any bag unless we pay extra! How much worst could this get on top of being discriminated against! We didn’t want to miss our flight so we paid extra to check in our bags in economy after they took our money for business class and refusing to refund it. I know, I keep repeating myself, but I want you to get the full scoop and understand how inconvenienced we we were!"

After arriving 3 hours early for 12pm flight, the gate opened at 10am, after about an hour of trying to figure out the battery, they changed me to the 7pm flight to allow me time to get emails from manufacturer regarding type of battery.  The counter would reopen at 5pm, I received the emails and showed the documentation, but they said it wasn’t sufficient for this type of battery.  When I called manufacturer, they said the airline was confused about lithium battery versus wet cell battery.  They sent another email to explain the difference.  Now the airline realized they were looking at wrong documents on their side and sent manager.  Now they tried to change saying they couldn’t prove these emails belonged to this scooter, even though I had the original purchase and all the emails under same email.  I was still understanding and understand, and just asked for my refund.  She said I would need to call, i agreed.  Then she insisted on explaining that this battery was not the battery the manufacturer of scooter and the battery manufacturer were claiming.  I told her maybe she is correct, I’m not a battery expert, all I can do is ask the people who made the mobility scooter.  When I was trying to call for refund, she persisted to keep talking and her colleagues were even laughing.  I just spent 8 hours waiting at airport, now I have no flight, have to call for refund, and she wanted to continue to tell me I was lucky they rebooked me with no cost and it was my fault.  I never once raised my voice, I asked her just to stop talking to me, but she continued to persist I MUST LISTEN TO HER.  I finally ignored her and said my review would talk for me.  After minutes of her talking, she realized I wouldn’t respond and she walked away.  She might be the most rude human being I have ever encountered.  I preach kindness, happiness, and love.

From my older experience they would serve the meal and then disappear for the rest of the flight. This time we were served three meals! Incredible! a proper lunch then a mid-flight tapas snack and finally a great tuna sandwich before arrival. The crew also went through the cabin with drinks and water regularly. Felt like a transformed airline. I had flown them a lot in the past but then avoided them for a few years. They definitely have improved a lot.

Again, it was within 5 minutes of the purchase so I gave eDreams a call. I was told that they can only change 3 letters and that even my small last name of Vigil would not be allowed to be corrected. I was then told to call Iberia and see if they could do anything about it. Classic shifting the responsibility back and forth onto the other company and leaving the customer getting hit back and forth like a game of tennis. Iberia told me they could do nothing about it but their company would end up penalizing eDreams for not providing a good enough service. I doubt that will actually happen. I ended up calling each company back for a span of two hours probably trying to get this issue resolved. Eventually, I thought for sure my problem would be fixed when eDreams said they would be able to fix my problem if Iberia simply sent them an email saying it was okay to change my name. Apparently a simple email was too much to ask for as I was told Iberia doesn't send any information by email which is a total joke. How would anything get done at the company without using email as a way to convey information? They send flight confirmation emails, so a simple email with a few words saying """"yes, you can change the name"""" doesn't seem like such a crazy ask.

We have gone to several stores, both dedicated kids/stroller stores and large chains who sell strollers like Walmart and Target. No one has heard of that certificate.

I asked her to ask them first if the bags are still on the cart, or already boarded on the plane. This will be my determining factor on if i should book a different flight, or stick to this one. She rolls her eyes at me, sighs and tells me she needs to know if I’m going to get a flight before she calls them. I tell her i will not give my word until I know that piece of information because I simply will not promise something that may result in me not following through. So she says something under her breath and finally calls them, throwing her hands and getting all excited on the phone.

However I will tell you that their """"customer service"""" people are mislabeled in the extreme, and their website seems designed to fail if you even breathe in the general direction of having an issue you want resolved - it will repeatedly pop up with messages that the system is """"not available at this time"""" or similar.  I was told that this is because I have a Mac and it works better in PCs which is either the worst lie ever told or they need to fire their web team and hire someone remotely competent.

If you fly this airline, keep your expectations low.  Then lower them some more.  And if you need customer service, consider instead seeking divine intervention - it's more likely to actually produce results."

I had to start recording the calls myself, as each time I had different information about changing my flight. I spent 3 hours on 9 different calls with them. As I was not getting anywhere with the operatives on the phone, I raised a complaint with a well-written letter explaining my problem and frustration. I had a generic reply 7 days later stating that they can't help me and not even replying to my questions. Terrible! I would give it 0 stars if I could. Never again. I cancelled my flight in the end, as I got fed up. Still waiting for my refund. Beware of their Flex policy, you will end up paying more than the £25 cancellation fee they advertise. So be careful!"

I found having to wait until 24 hours before the flight to check in unnecessary. To avoid this I ended up paying extra for 4 flights (that had been included in my original booking fee) to ensure we all sat together. 

When we arrived at Manchester airport, 3 hours before, the desk numbers were not visible. However we were told which desks they would be. 2 1/2 hours before the flight we started to queue up at the unopened desks. There was already a large queue building. Harry Styles was playing in Madrid the next day and the queue contained a lot of teenagers going to the concert. 

When checkin opened there were two Iberia staff checking the cases in. The first group were a group of about 8 who were slowly checked in with the exception of one of the girls. I don’t know what had gone wrong but it took 50 minutes to sort this one girl out. This meant that there was only one check in desk active for the whole queue. We effectively didn’t move for an hour. I can’t understand why a member of Iberia staff didn’t come from the back to sort out the girl so that the 2nd check in desk could clear the queue. At no point was any explanation given to anyone. It was a very stressful situation.  It would put me off flying with Iberia again."

I paid for two seats going and coming; when we checked in they said, “oh sorry we gave you different seats”. Mind you I paid extra for seats all the way upfront and they put us in the back of the plane. There was no accountability nor accommodating us for both of our flights. Our flight outbound was nothing memorable. The seats on the flight were horrible, extremely uncomfortable.  As soon as I got on the plane I needed the restroom. Now mind you, they are boarding new passengers on a new flight, yet the bathroom smelled like pee and has no toilet paper. There was trash everywhere. I was the first person to use the restroom and was completely disgusted. I immediately told the attendees that the bathroom needs to be cleaned. Within a 7 hour flights we were never asked if we wanted a cup of water. Also, my flight home was beyond a horrible experience. Sitting in the aisle row is a nightmare. The flight attendants were passing by continuously for 8 hrs and banging into me every single time and even kicked the passengers foot next to me to move his feet. So, if you’re trying to sleep on a 8 hour flights it’s impossible. On top of that only the people who pre-ordered food we tended to. Other guests apparently don’t have trash to throw out nor need assistance. This is the worst airline I have ever flown on aside from Norwegian Airways. In hindsight it seems like a better deal saving money taking this ratchet airline, but I strongly recommend taking any other airline."

Talking about food, my dog eat better, this is what you have for 12.5 hours: Hot meal, this time was pasta in tomato sauce and BBQ chicken, both were horrible and very small portion, the pasta was pasta and tomato sauce, no cheese, herbs, ..., then a piece of bread, 1 small potato salad and 1 chocolate mousse for desert, of course all portions are from the children menu... No butter, no little piece of cheese, no little fresh mint, no dressing, ... really bad.  End of flight meal was a tuna sandwich(??), luxurious!

8.9070987701416,4.52015018463135,"Iberia Flight Delays",1,"We booked a flight from Madrid (MAD) to Los Angeles (LAX) with American Airlines (AA). There were no direct flights, so AA partners with airlines like Iberia (IB) to make connecting flights. AA had us fly from MAD to London Heathrow (LHR) with IB, and from there we would take a direct flight from LHR to LAX with AA. We only had 90 minutes to catch the connecting flight, so when our IB flight was delayed for over 2 hours, we knew that we weren't going to make our connecting flight. I spoke with an IB employee while we were still in Madrid, and asked them if we should still fly to LHR since we're missing the connecting flight (or at the very least, start making accommodations for an alternate connecting flight). The IB employee said that there's nothing they can do at MAD, so we should take the flight to LHR and that they would figure it out once we arrive to London. We arrive at London 4 hours late (3 from the delay at MAD, and another hour at the gate at LHR because the door was jammed and they couldn't get it open... it's ridiculous but it really happened). Once we finally got out, there were no IB employees at LHR (they all leave at 8pm), so we went to AA's customer service. Well, AA can't help us because it's IB who was delayed (not AA's fault) , so the protocol in the airline industry is that the airline that caused the delay (IB) is the one responsible for making it right (I verified this with employees from other airlines, and that is the protocol) . Only problem is that all IB employees are gone for the night (they won't return until 6am), and their 24-hour customer service is trash, to say the least. The four different IB customer service reps that I spoke with said that since I bought the tickets from AA, that it's AA (and not IB) who have to book me a new flight home. Again, this is completely false (several reps from other airlines confirmed that it's IB that has to fix the problem because they were the reason why I missed my connecting flight). After 4 different phone calls totalling 90+ minutes on the phone (which I have to pay my carrier by the minute since I'm in a foreign country) IB was able to book us a flight to Paris, and from Paris take a 13-hour flight to LAX. Unbelievable... THAT was their solution to the problem that THEY created. Also, not once did they mention that we can get a hotel for the night and that they would have to reimburse us. However, we know our rights as airline passengers, and when I mentioned this, the IB reps were extremely vague as to how I can get reimbursed, or what my allowance was. The fact that these reps were vague in their response and shady when it came to taking responsibility (and the fact that our flight would require us to he back at the airport in less than 6 hours), we ended spending the night at LHR airport. For the record, AA doesn't get a pass on this SNAFU either, but IB is mostly at fault for this. It pains me to say this since I'm half-Spanish and I remember flying directly from LAX to MAD with IB as a kid when my mom would take us to visit my grandparents, but this cluster-f*** is unforgivable. Avoid Iberia if you can, because if they screw up, their """"customer service"""" will surely frustrate and disappoint you."

The airline provided us with a receipt that had no logo or much information that could identify them, It should be noted that none of the passengers on this flight received their luggage, so the airline should easily identify what happened. The luggage was finally delivered on the eve of our departure to Rome, which means that we practically spent our entire stay in Madrid without our luggage.

My wife and I had spent 8 months planning a trip for our family of five.  We had flight confirmation for all of us with American Airlines and were flying out of Boston to Barcelona with Iberia which was part of the booking.  When we arrived in Boston for our flights to Barcelona, we were told by the Iberia agent that four of our family members had boarding passes but one of our daughters did not have a confirmed pass.  I showed the agent the emails I had received stating that all members of our family had been confirmed for the flight with American Airlines (through Iberia).  We had flown to Boston from Indianapolis so I was able to show the Iberia agent our luggage tags for all five of our family members showing that we had confirmed flights for everyone from Indy to Barcelona with a layover in Boston.  The agent searched and again said that she didn't have any record of our daughter being confirmed for the flight to Barcelona and was told that we needed to go to the American Airlines counter to discuss.  We had already spent about 45 minutes with the Iberia agent at this point.  The check-in counter for American was 1 mile from the Iberia counter and there were no shuttles available at that time to take us to the other terminal.  All five family members ran from Iberia to AA (15 minutes) only to find out that there were no agents at the AA counter.  It was now about 1.5 hours before our flight was to leave.  So we ran back to the Iberia counter and told them there was nobody at the AA counter.  I asked them to look again to see why they weren't seeing my daughter's boarding pass and how would it be possible for us to have all of our luggage for all five passengers from Indy to Barcelona approved on the initial check-in if we ALL did not have boarding passes.  I asked if they could check to see if there was room on the flight to add my daughter because at that point I was desperate to get her on the flight and was willing to pay the money to make that happen.  The agent said that """"yes, there is room on the flight"""" but that we need to book the flight with American.  At this point, we had spent an additional 30 minutes arguing with them and it was getting close to the time that they were shutting the doors for the flight.  Another Iberia agent was calling American for us and we were told that there was now someone waiting for us at American Airlines counter at the other terminal.  We ran back again to the American Airlines counter and talked with an agent who, within three minutes, pulled up the boarding pass for my daughter.  At that point, the cabin doors to the plane had closed and we were no longer able to fly out that night.  When I asked the AA agent why Iberia wasn't able to see the boarding pass, she told me that she didn't know as they are privy to the same information that AA was and that the Iberia agent just didn't dig enough to find the boarding pass.  I can't tell you how upset my wife, my daughters, and I were about this.  We had two rooms booked in Barcelona and had planned on sightseeing in the city before getting on a cruise line for Spain, France, and Italy the following day.  When I called to cancel our rooms in Barcelona I was told that it was not within the 24-hour period of time to cancel.  So we're out $1,000 for the two rooms.  More importantly, our overall plan was to give our children an experience of a lifetime by starting our journey out sightseeing in the beautiful city of Barcelona.  8 months of planning, and everything spoiled due to Iberia not doing their jobs correctly.  It's also important to note that both of these agents from Iberia, along with a third that joined the discussion, only spoke in Spanish when not addressing us.  Given the circumstances, my wife and I felt that was extremely disrespectful.  Lastly, I am not an unreasonable person. Everyone makes mistakes and everyone has a bad day.  However, after pleading with them to take a closer look and to have them pass the buck to American Airlines, I think something needed to be said.  Coincidentally, the next day, when we were able to fly out of Boston on Iberia, the same person that had tried to help us the night before was there.  I asked to speak directly to her.  When I told her that AA had no trouble at all pulling up the boarding passes for all five of our family members, she said """"Yes, I heard about that this morning and it was completely our mistake for not getting your daughter on that flight last night""""   I am going to be reaching out to Iberia to pay for the hotel rooms that we had to pay for in Barcelona...but there is no way to repay my three daughters for the experiences that they missed out on...it was an absolutely horrible experience and one that was avoidable.

I'd not flown long-haul for several years, and never with Iberia so I wasn't 100% sure how it would be but it was fine. My one main disappointment was that upon boarding the in-flight screens suggested that there would be wifi available - which I thought would be great as it was an 11 + 1/2 hour flight! However, throughout the whole duration, no one was able to get wifi - it would just not work, either free or paid for it was just unavailable for the whole flight. However, there were plenty of in-flight entertainment options plus USB ports to keep phones etc charged which was welcomed. The seats were comfy enough with adequate legroom and you got a pack with a pillow/blanket/headphones too. The food/drink was nice, although, unlike some other long-haul airlines, the drinks were only included at meal times. For your main meal, you had a selection of two items, it was Spanish Chicken and chorizo in a tomato sauce with a salad or some type of pasta and a sponge cake with a choice of wines or soft drink/tea/coffee and water - all of which were nice. I think later on during the flight they came around offering a banana or another piece of cake and some more water/tea/coffee and then before landing they brought around a cheese panini (which was the only thing that wasn't great). Overall, other than the wifi there were no issues at all and I wouldn't hesitate to use Iberia - in fact, I will likely be flying back out to CR with them later this year!"

Instead, we will have to circle in the air for 2-3 hours to reduce weight and land safely. We landed with fire trucks and police cars everywhere. At the airport, they gave us a copy of our rights and the website where we can file a complaint, but they didn't tell us when we would be able to fly because that information will come in an email since the airport staff doesn't have access to ticketing. We go home, luckily we live relatively close. We receive an email telling us that we are flying in 2 days, on a flight with a layover in Dallas partially operated by American Airlines. On Friday, we go to the airport again only to find out that American Airlines doesn't have seats for us. We spent 4 hours on the phone with different people from Iberia, they hang up on us 3 times. We asked to speak to the manager and they denied it or told us a manager would call us back ( no one ever called us).

Stop at the Dali or Velasquez lounges at Terminal 4, in the gorgeous Madrid airport designed by Calatrava. Have dinner then a shower before boarding.

Long story: Within the first 3 weeks after my luggage went missing, I contacted Iberia several times and every time they told me they had no info whatsoever on the suitcase. They don't even know whether it ever left my departure airport, whether it did and was sent somewhere else....nothing! This was a suitcase I was forced to leave behind after I stepped on the airplane. I had entered the plane and a flight attendant literally pushed me out. At that moment we were standing at the top the stairs they use to get people on and off the plane. We are in authorised-only area, not at the check-in desk in a busy airport....here a company worker took the luggage, put a label on it and supposedly put in under the plane...easy, right?! Where can it goes from there?! Well, apparently to unknown mysterious places! After 3 weeks of waiting I used a Spanish association of lawyers* that deals with these kind of issues (it is a free service and you pay them a percentage only if they win for you), to make a claim for me. Iberia even had the guts to refuse the refund. The association is now moving the case forward in front of a judge.

This was only my second time flying with Iberia. The first time many years ago my luggage was delayed. It is not ideal but I understand these kind of things might happen...Unfortunately, what happened 3 months ago is on a completely different level and since then, if I meet someone who has flown with Iberia, they always have similar stories to share (experiences clearly supported from the numerous reviews on here!)! I really don't understand how this is possible...I have been travelling for decades, the majority of times with so-called """"budget airlines"""" but nothing like this ever happened, not even close. On the other hand, apparently, it is totally ok for Iberia to loose other people belongings on a systematic basis.

Needless to say, I am never flying again with Iberia, let alone suggest anyone to use them for their travel.

Once I arrived in Santiago, my luggage was lost and I had to wait until the following day for it to be returned to me.

To make matters worse, the flight back from Santiago to Berlin was operated by LATAM, and I was not informed during the buying process that I would not be able to select a seat until I arrived at the airport. As a result, I was unable to secure a window seat or any seat with extra legroom. Despite contacting Iberia to inquire about purchasing an upgrade, the plane was full and I was unable to obtain any additional space.

I am writing this review to share my experience with Iberia in hopes of saving others from the nightmare I have endured. I am not one to write reviews, but after what I have been through, I feel compelled to share my story.

I booked a business class ticket with Iberia for a holiday trip to my home country. At first, I was overjoyed to find such a good deal. However, my joy quickly turned to frustration when I discovered that I had been double charged for the same flight. I contacted Iberia, and they claimed it was a mistake from their end. Despite this, fixing the issue proved to be a daunting task. Every time I called them, I received different responses, and the problem persisted.

Eventually, I contacted my bank to dispute the transaction, and only then did Iberia respond. They canceled both of my tickets, even though the mistake was theirs, and they provided fraudulent data to my bank. They claimed both charges were legitimate, despite providing proof that the tickets were suspended.

After making numerous phone calls to Iberia, I was told that the flight might be canceled. However, if I did not ask, I would not have received a refund. I was also informed that the two tickets were valid and non-refundable, which was not the case. It is unacceptable for a large airline like Iberia to charge a customer for two non-existent tickets.

To make matters worse, I am still waiting for a resolution to my problem. It has been a never-ending cycle of claims, phone calls, and false promises. I was originally supposed to receive an email about my claim, but after a week and four phone calls, I was informed that Iberia does not send emails about claims.

In conclusion, I strongly advise against booking flights with Iberia. The airline may seem appealing, but it is not worth the risk. They do not value their customers, and their service is appalling. I am a middle-class person who saves up all year to afford a business class ticket, and Iberia's mistake has caused me unnecessary stress and anxiety. Spare yourself the trouble and book your flights with another airline."

I had tickets for trip in 2020 to Barcelona but Covid happened and they gave us credits of the same value for future use. I thought this was better than some domestic airlines (ie Frontier) where they gave us silly miles (that you're not able to use for many flights) instead and then didn't even do that on some flights ! Back to Iberia, I was hoping for good service when we used these credits for a new trip booked for April 2023. Our flight was schedule for late evening, after 11PM overnight to Barcelona from JFK. We got to the airport, checked in and were at the gate. Unfortunately my wife got her tooth cracked and from previous dentist visit this seemed like she'd likely need a root canal procedure, she was in pain. We called her dentist and they advised not to fly for 9 hours as that would aggrevate the pain even more - cabin pressure and such. We called Iberia and they tried to screw us by giving us an option to buy new tickets for this trip in the next few weeks that would require us to put out of pocket double the value of original credits, basically price went up 3 times ! This was nuts and we didn't take it and they refused to give us credits. Well, we went back home from the airport digusted with airline. Still, next day after my wife saw the dentist and got the doctors note I tried to open a ticket with Iberia to at least get our credits back. They refused. I then followed up again asking for reasons to refuse as they responded with very generic message, and got another generic refusal. 
Bottom of the story, will be avoiding this airline and advise anyone to do the same !"

The one piece of advice is Iberia do not clearly advertise the customer’s ability to cancel within 24 hours to receive a refund (+30€ fee). 

Initially CS advised I could cancel just one flight in the round journey and the refund would be processed in the form of an Iberia voucher.  I called back CS to confirm, to be told by a different operator, that I had to cancel both flights in the return journey and would receive the refund back into my bank account with a fee of € 30. 

In general I was happy with the solution and CS experience but advise Iberia to have 1 clear policy on refunds. Had I not called back to confirm it may have been a different situation. 

Another piece of advise for customers is to ask for your case number while on the phone with CS so you can track your refund."

In any case they don't send it there, but rather to an airport 4 hours away where they then want us to go get it. In the end the luggage is lost for 6 days before getting to the right airport (our vacation was three weeks).

During both cases we receive no service/information from Iberia about anything on either email or phone. Only because we ask for it in the airport do we get a meal to eat during our long stay in Madrid.

Proof of it is that I have qualified for Infinita Prime level, the highest they have. What I see more and more lately on long haul flights is that the catering is becoming worst every time.

I travel with many other airlines. On my way to the US this week I flew American Airlines  (I am an Executive Platinum). Food is much better at AA.
Also travel extensively with Qatar. Food is better there too, and the WC are always absolutely in perfect condition and clean throughout the flight. The fact that air hostess attend the WC on a regular basis is the key.
So, if IB can not improve catering and WC cleanliness in the future, I think other airlines will take a large part of their business."

We often take Iberia flights to Malaga, Jerez or Alicante that require making connections at Madrid's Barajas Airport, and until last year (April 20, 2022), we had been very lucky.  For starters, our takeoff from JFK was delayed for 45 minutes. That left us less than an hour to clear immigration control at Barajas (which was short-staffed and jammed with passengers) and race to the far end of a terminal to catch the connecting flight to Malaga, only to have the boarding gate closed on us. Since that episode, we now err on the side of caution and allow a least two or three hours to take a later connecting flight, which is not necessarily the one recommended by Iberia. Once cleared through immigration at Barajas, we then spend the hiatus in an airport lounge until the connecting flight is ready. No more mad dashes for us!

I argueed and pleaded and nothing worked. I went to BA website and booked myself the same roundtrip flights, but of course paid twice what I paid originally to Iberia. 

Now for part 2. I called Iberia to ask for my refund and they tell me they cannot issue refund of this flight, only a voucher. Needless to say that I lost it at this point. But yelling at customer service is useless, they are basically cannon fodder. The """"supervisor"""" is supposed to be available in 2 hours so I am calling back. 

Here's 2 items from Iberia's bill of Passenger Rights for cancelled flights

1. Compensation can be paid in cash, by electronic bank transfer, bank orders or bank cheques or, with the signed agreement of the passenger, in travel vouchers and/or other services.

2. 300 euros for all flights not included in the points above, when the re-routing offered has an arrival time at the destination of no more than four hours after the one initially scheduled on the reserved flight; or 600 euros ¡f the delay is more than four hours.

I will hold them liable for both items. This company is a complete scam."

We bought economy class tickets and upgraded them with Finnair points. The return price was 210 euros plus 20000 points.

Iberia packs even more passengers into its A321 than Finnair does. Iberia has 220 seats and Finnair has 209 seats. In business class, the middle seats are blocked away. Besides the front toilet, Iberia has only two rear toilets, Finnair has three.

The front cabin has got one row more by removing the tiny closet Finnair is having and moving the front wall forward so that it is partially on the side of the exit. The first row has quite the same legroom as Finnair has. Rows 2-10 have probably less.

In Madrid, Finnair business class passengers are not allowed to use the fast-track security. The lounge access is included. The Dali Iberia lounge is very spacious and excellent in service.

There was a group boarding. For row 1, it is advisable to be among the first ones inside the plane, because the overhead bins over 1AC are reserved for other stuff and you cannot have anything down during the takeoff and landing.

There was quite a lot of turbulence after the takeoff and it took a long time before the service was started. There were no hot towels before the drink service but a printed menu with two warm options was given before the food service. The food service was a complete three-course meal, no chocolate cookies as a dessert as Finnair serves.

Iberia is by far the worst customer service I have ever experienced . No one at the airline (both on the phone and at the airport ) cares if you make your flights. I was flying from Geneva to Miami via Madrid. The day before my flight departure Iberia changed my first flight from Geneva to Madrid so I only had a 55 minute layover. I immediately called and asked to be put on another flight as I knew the connection was tight and any little delay would cause me to miss my connection to Miami. I stressed how important it was for me to make it back to Miami on Saturday for work on Sunday . The representative refused to do anything and said she was texting her supervisor and he said no. I asked to speak to the supervisor and she said no. I then asked how much it was to change if I were to pay out of pocket and she hung up on me. Then of course the next day at the airport my first flight is delayed 25 minutes leaving me with a 30 minute connection. Keep in mind I also have to go through passport control. The attendants at the gate would not help me and said I had to “figure it out in Madrid”. I also called customer support and they said there was nothing they could do and would not put me on another flight . Horrible experience! Oh I almost forgot, on the way over they lost my bag for almost 48 hours which I did not complain about at all or request any money for even though I had to buy things out of pocket because I didn’t have my bag.

After the check in they gave me a voucher worth 8 Fr. and everyone knows how expensive the zurich airport is. With 8 Fr. you can barely buy a water. When I finally entered the plane someone was sitting on my chair and I had to go to the team and ask them to find me a new seat. I am shocked how rude and unorganized Iberia is. I would be ashamed working for this Airline.

Looking at the terms and conditions of Iberia lost luggage - it looks almost impossible to get any compensation! Trying to use their website is a nightmare and customer care services are very unhelpful.
My in flight experience for all the flights, but particularly the Madrid to London flight was unimpressive. There were 4 stewards serving 12 passengers in business and we were rushed through our lunch service, whilst they all huddled behind a curtain chatting and eating. The WC was closed off to passengers to prevent them for going behind the curtained area. On at least two occasions the cockpit door was left open four a period of time with nobody guarding access. On boarding the plane, no group numbers were used resulting in all passengers being loaded into buses together. This resulted is small babies and children being loaded towards the end. Parents had to struggle with pushchairs etc., with lots of people rushing to try and get on the plane. At first nobody guarded the end of the wing, and passengers were able to walk freely below as they accessed the front and back doors of the plane.

So I called again, and the Iberia customer service agent told me there would be a penalty to make the change... I said OK, this is fine.  And said, I would need to pay the fare difference.  I said OK, fine also.  And then he said he would check on the difference.  And put me on hold  for one hour.

I was on hold for so long I was concerned no one was on the line.  

So I called in from a second phone and started speaking with a second customer service agent.  While doing so, the first agent hung up on me.  

I explained the situation again to the second agent.  She gave me the information on the changed flights I was requesting.  Said the penalty to make each change is $199 per ticket, so total of $796 for four passengers. I said OK. And $25 each for a service charge, $100, again OK.  

Then she said the total I had to pay for each basic economy ticket  (which is the cheapest ticket they have) would be $5024.  For a total of $20,096, yes USD $20,096 to change all four tickets.  

I could not believe what I was hearing. The most expensive business class ticket is $4,886 on Iberia.com.  For the dates I wanted, Iberia.com showed all four tickets totaled $2,959.  With penalties, $3,855.  And that is without subtracting what I had already paid. 

INSANE!!!  She then explained to me Iberia.com's prices are for first time purchases and are special online rates... and they do not count for changing your flight.  I could not believe it.  I just laughed.... they wanted me to pay them $20,096 + the money I had already spent, to change our flights!  What alternate universe is this airline operating in?

With such an outlandish and outrageous claim, I can only expect this customer service is a reflection of the condition of their flight operations and personnel... not good.

Absolutely, the most incredible, unbelievable experience with an airline I have ever had.

Do not purchase tickets with them expecting to be able to make any changes unless you want to pay $5000+ for each trip."

They're mostly written by two groups of travelers.
First are travelers who had any kind of misfortune - their luggage lost, flight delayed or missed, etc... Not being in a position much more to do they write a review due to stress (and money lost) they encountered and that review becomes their exhaust valve. And, I understand them. But, such bad and unpleasant things can happen on any flight on any airline. So, take these reviews with a great reserve to judge an airline.
Second group are travelers who still think that flying (specially national carriers) should be a 5 star hotel experience. That's a long gone era. Low cost carriers forced major airlines to lower the prices which resulted in service scrap. So, change your attitude - as a traveler in the """"cattle"""" economy class you should observe your experience as a transportation from point A to point B safely. Don't expect feasts onboard except you're flying Business of First class, but that's times 3 or 4.
Third group of reviewers/travelers is the largest one, but almost non existent here.
Those are travelers who made their journey successfully without issues and they consider it normal, without a need to write a review about it.

We had 4 flights with Iberia in December 22 and January 23.
Two European on A320 Zurich - Madrid and back, and two intercontinental on A332 Madrid - San Juan and back.
We bought our tickets in April and for the return journey Zurich-Madrid-San Juan and back paid a bargain price of 500 Euros pp (luggage included).
On European flights there's nothing included, even water's paying.
But, it's a 2 hours flight - what do you need for that ??? Still if you do, you can buy sandwiches on board or take them with you beforehand.
On intercontinental flights a meal and a snack was served like in any other European flag carrier. It does not differ from any other I flew with recently - Air France, KLM, Lufthansa....
Meal is hot with a choice of mainly chicken or pasta with salad, cheese and cake. Complimentary soft drinks, beer or wine and coffee. Snack is a kind of sandwich.
What more you need ? It's not a feast, but a fair meal to keep you fed.

Each of 4 those flights arrived before scheduled time at destination despite being little late at departure. Later, I've read somewhere Iberia has among the world's best punctuality rating.

So, be and think positive, regard it as a mean of transportation, plan ahead and enjoy. Thumbs up for Iberia."

10.7497081756592,5.94091367721558,"Iberia Luggage Problems",1,"Already posted a review for this trip, just completing the story since update. I travelled to Marseille (France) from Manchester (UK) through a connection in Madrid. First flight delayed, and my boarding pass was only available an hour after the opening of check in and bag drop off desks... Madrid flight leaves on time close to 10PM. I was told my baggage delayed when I arrived in Marseille... a delay that lasted over 2 months... I kept on calling and going in person to airports but everyone pointed fingers at each other, leading me to go around in circles, looking for a luggage THAT WAS NOT EVEN REGISTERED IN THE SYSTEM.  
I was told this was probably because the tags might have come off the bag during transportation therefore couldn't be scanned, and enter the tracking system. After the 21 day mark I claimed a compensation for the expenses it costed and the value of my luggage. I usually keep all my receipts and online purchases invoices. I was able to provide proof for over £2,500 worth of belonging in between presents, cosmetics, jewellery,  winter clothing, and the extra cost of baggage handling. Iberia took the longest time to review my emails I had to call them to check them while on the line because my messages were getting 'lost in mail'. This can sound very pushy but I am student living on my own and I was missing most of my winter clothing, and basic hygiene products in times of 0 degrees Celsius, and £2,500 short on money. 
Finally Iberia decided to compensate the amount of £1,340, independently from the search of the bag, which they declared to be the highest amount they could refund me. I asked why they just said that was all they could refund. 
On the same day, a friend went to Madrid airport to ask about the luggage which still didn't appear on tracking system. When my friend described the bag they declared having sent it back to the U.K. Weird since they are meant to scan a luggage to send it, right? I don't know what they are taught to do in baggage handling, but I am pretty sure when you send something over, specially in an international flight, for obvious security reasons, you have to put a label and scan a bag. But apparently not they just sent a 'similarly described' bag back to the UK but they could not confirm to which airport. I call Iberia about this. It's not on the tracking system. 
2 weeks later I decided to go to Manchester myself. I guessed it was the airport of departure so the logical thing would have been to send it back there. I had to wait over 2 hours for staff to tell me they did not have the bag and that my case showed as closed. I asked how that could be and they said that it could only be done if the bag was declared found, which it clearly wasn't. Out of curiosity I asked whether that was something only Iberia could do, and yes. Meaning Iberia stopped the search of my bag after they refund barely half of its content value without notifying me. 
I later call Iberia to ask about this and the lady very rudely told me that since i had been compensated they closed the case. When I reminded her that it was meant to be independent from the refund she got worked up and told me off and that was ridiculous. I told her that I didn't just assume this information, I was told on the phone before accepting to go forward with the compensation, and that considering she had the same name and voice as the woman who said it, she was the same one. She denied specifying this to me although I remember asking her to make sure I wouldn't be screwed this exact way...
I leave it at that, I can't ask for more compensation, I have lost most of my winter clothing, and underwear, that I will have to replace. I have no information on my luggage, and their poor administration and handling abilities ruined Christmas holidays with family. 
On Friday the 17th I receive a call from London Heathrow Airport saying they have found a bag at my name and it corresponded the description, I go there to pick it up and turns out it had all the tag and little extra stickers for all my flights, and the one stating they sent it back to the U.K. via American Airlines. 
So either Iberia and luggage handling company has deplorably unskilled workers, or I almost got scammed off £1,500 and 23kg of belonging. I obviously don't think this was purposely done to steal the baggage but nevertheless, Iberia staff has be one of the most incompetent at baggage handling and communication I have ever experienced. Like I said in my previous review, I'll avoid it at all costs. They have built themselves a reputation and most reviews on here sadly show a fraction of the people they have screwed over."

After  an uneventful 2 flights to Madrid on other airlines we had one last flight to Marrakech on Iberia. We stood at the gate until departure time with no updates and at that point we were told the flight was delayed and expect an update in 2 hrs. The flight ended up leaving 3 hrs late and none of our bags arrived with us at our destination. We were forced to delay our plans out of Marrakech while waiting for our lost bags. At no point did Iberia offer an apology or compensation to purchase essentials while we waited. We also purchased upgraded seating on the flight and when we boarded our seats were occupied and we were moved a row forward from our original seats. Shortly after boarding the flight attendant came to us and said we needed to be moved out of upgraded seating to the back due to weight and balance issues. The people in our original seats were not moved and,later, other people were actually moved and re-seated in those seats? Apparently not weight and balance issues.

Fast forward to our flights home 2 weeks later. When we arrived home in Portland one of our 3 bags did not arrive for our transfer in DFW.  Customer service in DFW seems to have no clue how to handle this and simply gave all of us a confusing internal form to fill out that was obviously meant to be filled out by a customer service employee. After completing the form as best we could we gave it back to the agent and requested a tracking number... she said that was not possible. Fine, off we go to run for our connecting flight. The next day I call and the agent has difficulty tracking the bag because we did not have a lost baggage referral number. Eventually they find it using the original baggage claim number and said it was to arrive at our final destination late that night. The next day I call Iberia again to confirm it had arrived and had the oddest, and most disappointing, experience with the customer service agent. I gave her the same baggage claim number after explaining we had no lost baggage referral number because Iberia did not issue one when we filed the claim. The claim number was now somehow in another name and the agent accused me of lying, saying that was not my claim ticket it belonged to someone else. I offered to email her a picture of the claim ticket with my name on it and the number but she refused. She again forcefully said this was definitely NOT my luggage claim ticket. I had hit a frustrating dead end, and simply gave up. Later in the day I go to my local airport and the bag was indeed there... with a rush tag on it and with the exact claim number I had offered.    

Ok, so stuff happens and i'm really pretty easy going. Was it inconvenient to wait for 
 bags and reschedule a tour out of Marrakech at the beginning of our trip? Yes, but it wasn't the end of the world.  My biggest issue is at NO point through any of this did Iberia show any concern or offer even the simplest apology for  our inconvenience.

First, my trip was cancelled but I received no notification until the moment I tried to do the check-in. I tried to receive support from Iberia / Vueling / Level and they all acted like children that were fighting each other and blaming the other company for not knowing how to do the right thing. Meanwhile, I found myself in the middle of this childish discussion with no one taking responsability. I finally managed to get help, and the only alternative I receive from Level is to fly THREE DAYS LATER on a transcontinental flight (or a refund that obviously solves nothing if I want to buy a ticket from Spain to the US on the same day). Completely outrageous.

I then try to get compensation for the expenses I needed to incur during those 3 extra days while I was waiting to fly, and then again neither Level nor Iberia want to take responsability. To clarify, it was Iberia who should take responsability given they were operating the flight.

If this was not enough, Iberia lost my luggage and did not return it until 3 days adfter my arrival to Boston. AND the only reason I got it back was because I insisted and went unrequestedly to the airport, where I found my bag in the room where they keep the lost bags. They had not even bothered to call me.

Worst thing is that they give no guidelines whatsoever about what you can buy during the days when they leave you with nothing; the only guidelines I received from a staff in the airport is 'don't worry about expenses, they'll need to cover'. I buy the basics I need, clothing, basic hygine products... and once I try to receive compensation, Iberia concludes that they will only refund 20% of the total expenses I incurred during the 3 days, which included a return trip to the airport (25% of what they refunded).

I had an economy seat on board IB6251 from MAD to JFK on 18 January 2023. I was seated in 21A, which was directly behind the Premium Economy section. I noticed that Premium Economy had several seats available after general boarding had concluded. So, I asked a flight attendant if I could relocate to a Premium Economy seat and he replied, “No. It is not possible. This is our policy.” I was surprised and confused by his response because earlier I watched a couple that was seated in the same row as me ask him to relocate to Premium Economy and he immediately accommodated their request.

After I returned to my seat, I watched during the next 5-10 minutes as several passengers - couples, singles, a parent and child - being escorted from Economy and re-seated in Premium Economy. These were the same passengers who I saw earlier boarding the aircraft and were seated behind me in Economy.

Here’s my point of contention:  If there is a “policy”, as referenced by this flight attendant, that prohibits passengers from upgrading a class once on board the aircraft, then this policy should apply to all passengers. This flight attendant was remarkably dishonest! How is it that for me such a move was not possible per “policy”, but for at least 7-9 other passengers an upgrade was not only permissible, but encouraged? To whom is this area “off-limits”? Americans? People of color? Folks wearing all black? A black man wearing all black? What was the difference between me and those passengers who were afforded an upgrade?

There are far more cheaper airlines  that are more competent of providing a proper services than Iberia let me share with you  my travelling nightmare experience. When you go on vacations it is a time to renew yourself physically and mentally. Not a time to spend hours fighting with  an Airline in order for them to deliver your travel bags to your home or destination.

I flew to Bogota, Colombia  mid December using Iberia. I have travelled to this destination in the past  through different  airlines in past years having no trouble what so ever. This time it was a complete nightmare since when we (my wife and I) arrived to our destination, our travel bags had been left in Madrid. We originally flew from Frankfurt with overlay in Madrid. At the counter for the bag drop they explicitly told us that our luggage would automatically reach the final destination. Once we arrived to Bogota Iberia workers explained to us that our luggage was left in Madrid and that after filling a report it would be delivered to our home. 

The next night the Iberia worker called and said our luggage would be delivered on the next morning. The day after we decided to call Iberias contact center, where they said that they could basically see the same information  that was displayed in the tracking site on the Iberia webpage to us, and for further resolution we would haver to call directly a number in spain (+34) 90011342.  I asked if Iberia would cover the outbound call: answer (NO). I called the number only to find out that nobody picked up since it was out of services. After 3 days  we called again to complain only to receive the answer that if we needed to buy something (like a toothbrush Iberia would pay the cost for basic need items). So on the fourth date we decided to go to the airport in Bogota to Iberias offices  where the person who had called us in the first date told us that according to her tracking the luggage was already delivered. This was completely false and after she contacted the delivery service a (cab/Taxi) They said they would deliver it in the next 40mins. It was the only way to get our luggage for our vacation trip.

We flew 2 days ago back to Frankfurt with the same itinerary  from Bogota with overlay in Madrid to finally reach Frankfurt also with Iberia. airlines. The plane that took us from Madrid to Frankfurt looked more like a charter plain than a real commercial airplane i don't think it had more than 40 seats(maybe to safe up cost). I did not feel safe in this airplane at all. To my surprise when we arrived to Frankfurt our luggage did not arrive and even more surprisingly it was not only me but 7 or 8 other customers who had flown directly from Latin American countries and had there connecting flight in Madrid. It was as it the small charter plane was to small to fit all luggage to fly to Frankfurt. Two days have passed since I have arrived  home and had to buy toiletries just to look decent when I go to work since, my luggage has not arrived and have not even been notified of the status or whereabouts of my personal belongings. I would never recommend anyone I know to use this airline, it is the worst airline in the world. At the airport I requested for an e-mail or an address where I could sent a written complaint this was not provided since you can only contact them through phone. Pretty sketchy if you ask me."

Unfortunately if you want to go to Spain, you will likely have to experience their incompetence firsthand. I booked with American Airlines from Charlotte NC USA to Alicante Spain with connecting flights through London Heathrow and Madrid. American partnered with Iberia for the London to Madrid and Madrid to Alicante legs. In London the gate assignment for an 11:25 departure wasn't posted to the boards until 11:10. This was problematic as depending on where you are in Heathtrow, it can be up to a 30 minute walk between gates. It turned out the departure time of the flight was also delayed but never reflected on the boards. After arriving late into Alicante, we waited on the aircraft another 40 minutes at the gate because, as the flight crew explained, there wasn't anyone available to extend the jet bridge or block the aircraft wheels. Was our arrival a surprise? With the late arrival, deplaning delay, and distance between the gates in Madrid, I missed the flight to Alicante by mere minutes. The misadventure begins. I waited 30 minutes in line at the Iberia service desk to be told there were no more flights to Alicante and I would need to stay overnight in Madrid. I decided to take the 2.5 hour train ride from Madrid to Alicante instead of staying overnight. No offer by Iberia to reimburse me for this 65 Euro additional cost. I asked about my bag and was told by the Iberia desk upstairs that since I missed the flight, I would need to collect my bag in Madrid by going downstairs to carousel 6. After 45 minutes of watching new bags dribble in and existing bags go around the carousel with no sighting of my own bag, I stood in line another 30 minutes for the Iberia downstairs service desk to be told that my bag had actually gone on to Alicante without me (apparently my bag traversed the Madrid airport faster than I did and actually made the flight) and I would need to collect it at the Alicante airport. Off I go on the trains from Madrid airport finally arriving in Alicante at 9:30 pm apparently far too late in the evening to get any assistance from Iberia on picking up a bag at the Alicante airport. Ok. I’ll just go back to the airport and collect my bag in the morning so off to my hotel in Benidorm. Next morning at Alicante airport, Iberia baggage service representative keys my information into her computer and tells me not only is my bag not available for pickup but her system doesn't even show I have a bag. I feel like I'm trapped in an episode of Little Britain where “Computer says no.” Next I need to complete a form (blank sheet of paper where I wrote my name, email address,  phone number, and local address…feels very official) so they can search for my bag. I'm told I should call twice a day to check the status of the search. I call later in the day to be told my search profile is incomplete and they need my email address, phone number, and local address. It seems the official form, i.e. blank paper I wrote on, from earlier in the day didn't make it all the way through to their system.  Summation: I arrived on Wednesday and it is now Saturday but still no bag. Conclusion: Iberia airline is a logistical sh!tshow. The end?"

I chose the upgraded flexible no-change fee option, booked and paid at the Iberia website, and received confirmation and an itinerary from them.

I tried to contact Kayak.  That was an utter nightmare worthy of a separate review, but the upshot is that Kayak is not a booking agent OR a """"third party"""", they just assemble the itinerary.

I then contacted American, which flies the first leg of the itinerary.  They assured me they are not the booking agent, Iberia is, but for a $50 fee changed the problem flights.

Upon further review, I realized that the layovers on the remaining flights are really too short and get me into Madrid too early.  And guess what.  Even though Iberia has a much better flight leaving a few hours later, they won't change my ticket because they're not the booking agent. Kayak won't help me because they're not the booking agent.   And American wants $2000 extra (plus another $50) to put me on a flight that costs the same as the one I have.

So. I've spent a total of 32 hours fifteen minutes online, or on hold, or speaking with people who can't help me.  I've paid for a flexible ticket I can't change, priority boarding on a flight I'm not taking, a seat upgrade on another flight I'm not taking, and checked luggage I never needed to check, it was part of the """"flexible"""" package.

Nobody has information at Iberia! 

Just today, I spoke to an agent —- mark you, have called every single day and it’s the first time someone said—- we found a match for your bag tag on Dec 11th but there is no further information. If there was a match, why am I still not with my bag 2 weeks later? 

He also went ahead to tell me, you can declare the bag lost and we will stop looking! I have to declare my bag lost while I entrusted you and paid you  (Iberia) to safely transport it?

Transit in Madrid was a joke, they gave us 60 minutes and we arrived about 5 mins early, so far so good. Arrive T2 and we had to transfer to T3, Saw a sign saying 20 minutes transfer time so we bolted, rushed through security, made the next shuttle (it was packed but we pushed in as the doors closed on us) ran through the huge T3 and made our closed gate 5 mins before departure and thankfully they let us on. We had a dream run- do NOT accept a connection with Iberia at Madrid under 90 minutes, be warned. The worst was to come, arrived Toulouse with my wife's bag only, spent 1 hr logging a lost bag and then our holiday turned to crap. Iberia said it would arrive on the next flight, nothing. Day 2 we are told it would arrive, again nothing. Day 3 in same clothes nothing from Iberia. Emailed them, no reply, rang number as directed and told by abrupt operator : sorry sir you bag had not been found yet so I cannot advise when you will get it back. Now desperate and not sure If I will ever see bag again, check Iberia website and it states they will cover up to 1.100 euros for lost luggage so a I had to attend a wedding the next day went and bought some replacement clothes, neat casual only not the expensive suit in my luggage. Bag finally arrived at 5.00pm on day 5. Have put in a claim with Iberia and heard nothing.. Went online with our case number and found out it was """"closed"""", nobody told us. Complained again and they have offered pay approx. 1/3rd of our 800 euros of expenses.. Have said they have paid us on Oct 25th by """"cheque in the mail"""" (oldest trick in the book!) and here we are today with nothing after 2 more enquires to Iberia.

While Iberia reimburses travelers for some expenses relating to not having baggage, they don't reimburse everything.
Finally, there's some kind of gap between customer service and the lost baggage department. Talking to customer service is like talking to the wind.

For safety sake, before I make payment for upgrade, I tried to add luggage. but the website did not allow it. Seems like it is set for 2 pieces right?....WRONG

At the airport, I was served by the worst ground staff ever, when I showed my luggages, she just said pay 60 Euro, I said I am in Business Class, She just said """"You Upgrade, only 1 piece"""", I said """"I tried to add on-line but I could not"""", she ignored the statement, and just asked """"How you pay?"""", as if telling me that I have no choice if I want to fly. I felt digusted at being tricked by the airline and the treatment of the ground crew.
Upon reaching the plane, I was shocked that there is no actual Business Class seat, instead it was just a normal economy seat with an empty seat between the passangers. Imagine... across the width it was 3 seats left and 3 Seats right, but on the flight it was """"1 passanger + emplty Seat +1 passanger and 1 passanger + emplty Seat +1 passanger"""".
The airline website misleadingly showed as """"2 Seats left and 2 Seats Right"""", so whoever booked Business Class will not get the wider seat or the extra leg-space (only those in the first row).
Adding insult to injury is that the cabin crew used the lugage space meant for the passanger to put their hand luggage, thus making me go back 5 rows to retrieve my luaggage when the plane landed.

I boarded a flight with my partner the previous week and I had no problems at all so why now am I feel like this is discriminating me maybe because of my Race I don’t know. She didn’t want to reason with me and told me I will not board this plane I find this very painful as I have never in my life had any other problem with no other airlines and as I use Iberia a lot I didn’t expect this at all from a large company with yourself.

I was then refused to board the plane and couldn’t even get the next flight as she declined that also which wasn’t her duty to action this. I now have lost out on 1. Business meeting and 2. Money I have paid for this flight. Also, money I purchased a return flight for the 20th of October flight number 3180 at 16.50pm.

I would appreciate if you could look into this for me as I will be taking this further if this doesn’t get resolved I will also be contacting the metropolitan Police for my complaint. 

I look forward to your reply.

Because of that the flight got delayed by 1.5hours and we (along with our entire plane) missed the connecting flight from Madrid Spain back to USA. The agent in Barcelona did not tell the group why the flight was delayed. Iberia does not communicate anything with their customers, at the gate, nor on the plane, nor through any of their staff. Once we landed in Madrid we all went to the nearest information kiosk to get new tickets. The line grew, then staff came to take us to a different information kiosk in a restricted area. People were panicking at this point as the realization set in that none of use were getting out of Madrid that day even though it was around 1130 am. A lady even had a panic attack and required a medic.  Over 600 people were in the line for new tickets and only TWO Iberia AGENTS WERE WORKING. They had no rush and were so slow. We were towards the front of the line and it took us 6 HOURS to get to the counter. We tried calling the Iberia airline number and they told us that they don't have change fees but would have to pay the fare difference for a new ticket which would have been $800 USD per person. Even though the flight delay was not our fault. So we decided to stay in the line. Some people contacted their own companies and just bought new tickets for their destination, as the line was not moving. People began to get desperate and angry and began to cut which lead to fights. We were in a secured area of the Madrid airport so we could not leave to get food or water. Mother's with children were in the line. Iberia staff were rude and threatened to not help many people in line who were getting upset or even said """"if you don't stop yelling see if we will ever get you out of here!"""" At one point the boss came and said """"everything will be ok, just stay in the line we will help you in no time"""" however we waiting 3 more hours after that. The agents would finish their shift and leave, or would get angry and disappear for periods of time, there was no rush at all to help anyone. By the time we got to the front a huge fight broke and the """"guarda civil"""" or the police came. My husband was filming all the choas on his phone and instead of the police demanding order within the crowd, they came to my husband and yelled at him to stop filming them and demanded his passport and told him to go with them. They threatened to prosecute him or not allow him back in the country if he posted the video. It was the most frustrating moment of my life. We finally got new tickets (mostly because around hour 3 we called costco travel and they helped us but still had to stay in the line to get our new boarding passes) and the Iberia agent gave us a hotel voucher. We had to take a bus to the hotel and once we were there realized that hotel was housing Ukrainian refugee women with their babies. The whole thing was odd and strange, but we were grateful for a bed. We slept 3 hours (after being in the Madrid airport for 18hrs) and then took the bus back to catch our flight out of Spain. Never in my life have I seen such chaos, disorganization, sheer incompetence, lack of communication and respect from an airline company. I will never fly Iberia again, and neither should you. If your flight is delayed, or you miss a connection, etc good luck getting anyone on their team to give you any customer service. I loved my time in Spain but this airline singlehandedly makes me never want to go back to that country."

There were 20 some passengers trying to make this connecting flight and upon arriving at control point Iberian Airlines had closed the flight and did not let anyone proceed to the gate.    We were not offered the same courtesy as we had accepted with their delays.   Then it took 3 hours to make arrangements for another flight.  They did put us up in a third rate hotel, the  Melia airport suites with peeling paint and dinner in a basement dining room.  The shuttle  to airport  only left twice a day so we would have to leave the hotel 5 hours before our flight to utilize the service.  We will never fly this airline again and feel that it is inexcusable that they did not wait for 20 some passengers flying from Madrid to Dallas  running late for Iberians's delays with no other fights available.

There was a direct to Los Angeles to Barcelona from there we hopped on Ryanair from Barcelona to Brindisi. The price was great and I booked it on Iberia. I booked in April my flight left in September and returned in October. The App for Iberia was very non-user-friendly if you wanted to do any changing or exchanging of seats or upgrading. I did not realize that Iberia contracted out with LVL air lines and figured it out when LVL sent me a form to fill out for food request. The seats were the most uncomfortable seats. I am a woman 5’2” tall and I felt very cramped you can only imagine how uncomfortable My husband seat was. I spent extra money to purchase seats together row five on the way there and 5JNL on the way back I purchased the seats in April our flight was in September and return  October. The day we were to check in for a return flight it showed that I was in seat 36J and my husband could not check in to get a seat. We went to the airport the day before just to make sure that my husband was checked in properly and that our seat for it be what we paid for in row five. I was told by two ticket agents that they were not able to do anything for us since this was a level flight. They told us to contact level we tried to contact level I only got recordings and never spoke to a person at level and the recording said if we booked through Iberia or a travel agent we would need to do any changes through Iberia airlines. I explain this to both ticket agents . one sent me to a different  check-in line and finally the third ticket agent was able to at least check my husband in and seat us in row 25J and 25L together. They appesantitosi sold our seats to some other people and would not change their seats to the back . We were out of luck because the other couple checked in before us . Which is ridiculous since we purchased those seats back in April before anyone else .  they were not able to refund the money I spent on our original seats which were an upgrade. Now that I’m back I have to go through hoops to try and get my money back it is not going to be easy and Iberia keeps no records apparently I have all my records thank goodness but it’s going to be a disaster and I’ve wasted so much time already they can’t pay me the amount of time that I’ve spent trying to fix this mess that they created. The seats are extremely cramped the food is not good I would never fly this airlines again.

On arriving at Tel Aviv Airport and on finally reaching the Business Class Lounge (the one we were initially directed to was closed) we were informed that the lounge had reached its maximum capacity and it was standing room only.

We had been informed by the Airline in advance to expect on the plane 2m flat beds and a gourmet food service.  No such thing.  The staff couldn't either muster up a pillow or blanket.    The passengers were routinely informed that this was a short haul flight (5 hours 20 mins) and we shouldn't expect such things (despite the airline saying otherwise).  Frankly the Cabin Crew service was nonexistent.

To compound matters on arrival the Airline lost the business class luggage.  No apology no nothing.  We were simply informed that the luggage would turn up eventually and be patient.  In their defence the luggage did materialize.  2 hours later.

We have subsequently tried to bring these shortcomings to Iberia's attention, but they just don't care.  We received an abrupt and very rude response in return saying that we should have expressed our grievances on debarkation of the flight.  Sorry but we couldn't as we was too busy trying to locate our luggage.

I booked a round-trip ticket on Iberian's website from Boston to Mallorca a few days ago.  The final leg of the return was to be on its partner British Airways (BA) from London to Boston.

After booking the flight online, I called BA the next day to reserve an aisle seat. The BA rep told me that  a seat was 'temporarily' being held for me with a reservation code but that the ticket had not been confirmed and technically had not been issued.  He said I had to call Iberia and have them 'link the ticket' so that I could actually get on the BA flight.

Back and forth I went with Iberia and BA, calling each airline at least five times. This is what the two companies had in common:

  1. Neither Customer Service (CS) team was willing to contact the other airline to make sure I was properly ticketed.
   2. Neither CS rep would allow me to escalate the issue and speak to a supervisor or anyone higher

BA said I had to have Iberia fix the problem. Iberian reps all maintained that everything was perfect with my ticket.

Boarding passes were issued for both segments at Porto and confirmation that our check-in bag would also be transferred. There was significant delay at Porto airport however which led to our delayed flight arriving in Madrid and despite being at the gate for IB0512 in time for final call, we were advised the system had bounced us off. We are now on a waiting list for the next flight to A Coruna, stranded at Madrid airport.
We anticipated a delay would make the connection challenging given lines at Porto aiport and spoke to numerous airline staff in Porto and while on the IB3091 flight, asking to be prioritised for disembarkation and next flight advised so our connection could be guaranteed - however were assured everytime that Iberia Airlines was aware and because we had boarding passes, this would not be an issue. This turned out to be false and untrue, and the lack of care and prioritisation is very disappointing from a global airline. We even received text messages acknowledging our spots on IB0512 flight up until 15 minutes of our arrival at the Madrid airport gate when we were then denied boarding - with no reason provided at all.

Autistic people tend to block themselves in unexpected situations and that is what happened. Instead of helping him, the Iberia employees mistreated him with his attitude, indifference and lack of empathy.

Advising that they had the passport, we immediately called, and an employee named Carmen yelled at me that they were not to blame, she did not offer us any help despite the fact that we told her that the young man was autistic and needed help, on the contrary. hung up the phone on us.

We were able to find him an accommodation 20 minutes from the airport and the next day they told him that he could not leave on the scheduled one because it was full, they sent him to Customer Service, there the employees refused to speak with him in English, which is the language he knows. , and they told him that he had to wait for the next flight, I was able to get him a ticket for the next day with American Airline, flight number 95 at 10:05 am. When Iberia saw that it had another flight, they canceled the one it already had. Looking for help, I called and managed to talk to Mr. Felix Juaranz, and after explaining the situation and trying to cover the company at all costs, he told me to tell my son to go to post 850 and talk to Alicia, one of the supervisors, at that moment my 25-year-old son went into total desperation and crisis to the point that he couldn't tell where he was and started to cry like a child; at that moment, the pain and helplessness of us here was indescribable for not being able to help him, finally after more than 7 or 8 calls to Mr. Juaranz, he agreed to put him on flight IB 6253 and had him searched all over the world airport until they finally found him and a certain Ramon from Iberia took him to the plane where he had to wait until he arrived.

For the latter, we deeply thank Mr. Juaranz, but the mistreatment, lack of sensitivity, and irresponsibility of Iberia employees have caused deep pain to the family and an impact of which we do not yet know the consequences on our son. .

This attitude of Iberia must be condemned in its entirety due to the deep impact it has caused and its mistakes that have had serious consequences on a young autistic person.

From JFK-MAD, we were stuck on the tarmac for almost two hours because they couldn’t get the engine started. The AC didn’t work without the engine on, it was 85°F (30°C) outside, and they insisted on keeping the window shades up, so the plane was incredibly hot.

On the way back, the issues were again from MAD-JFK. I wasn’t able to pull up our boarding passes even after uploading pictures of our passports, as requested, and having those pictures be approved. Bari airport wasn’t able to give us our boarding passes either and MAD had to hand write our boarding passes. I’m guessing we got lost in the system somewhere because our bags made it to MAD but not JFK. Our bags then went from MAD-JFK-LGA-CLT-PHL-our home airport. 

We got our bags 5 days later and someone had gone through and stolen our alcohol, a power strip, my hair straightener, and all of my lipsticks (gross). I remembered that I’d seen our bags a few days ago at someone’s house in Queens, NY (I put AirTags in our bags) and figured out that an employee from the courier service, BEX Delivery, who delivered our bags from JFK-LGA had taken our bags home overnight and rifled through them. The cost to replace the lipsticks alone was like $400 (20 were stolen at $20 each), so they got away with $500 worth of our stuff.

First of all, they book flights with 1 hour layover which is minimum legal requirement, but it's not enough time to between Terminal 4 and 4S in Madrid. You have to deplane, walk miles in the airport, go through passport line, take the train to the next airport and boarding closes 15-20 minutes before the flight departs.  

Secondly, I checked my bag at Barcelona hours before my departure, so early there wasn't even a line at the check-in counter. I saw my bag get checked and leave on the belt. Somewhere between Barcelona and Madrid, airline staff or security staff went through all my stuff in my luggage and STOLE things from my checked baggage. They even dumped all the clothes from my laundry bag and went through my first aid kit. Whoever did it was very selective. They stole my camera accessories and gold jewelry pieces, which are small items that you wouldn't notice is gone until later when you need it.

Second, during a 12hr 45m flight, they offer customers drinks maybe 4 times. Once with lunch, tapas, and the snack, and one more time in between. For flights that long, you’d expect staff to be present within the cabin and checking on what people need. After lunch service, they literally disappeared and you would see maybe one staff member walk down the length of your part of the plane every 15m, if that. Moreover, they’re completely unfriendly. Third, on every other long haul I’ve been on, I’ve been able to order snacks and drinks if I wanted to by pressing the call bell. During a long haul flight, I’d maybe do this once. Otherwise I’d usually just wait until service time to make things easier. Since I hadn’t seen staff, I pressed the call bell and asked the staff member who came over for an orange juice please. He replied “can you come up to the front and get it”. I was shocked. It’s like ordering a drink at a restaurant and having the staff member ask you to come to the kitchen to collect your beverage. It makes no sense - especially when we’re sat in these tiny seats for almost 13 hours non-stop. Completely disappointing. I would never waste money on this airline again.

Anyway benefit of the doubt and all that jazz fly from Edinburgh on 16th to London Heathrow. This is where the real clowning/fduckery begins. Land in Heathrow after a 2 hour delay in Edinburgh at 6pm with the connecting flight London to Madrid leaving at 6.45pm. A healthy sprint from terminal 5 to 3 plus connection security and I made the flight. Sadly my luggage (suitcase and guitar) were not so fortunate. Arrive in Madrid and as instructed wait at the belt for my luggage after landing at 10.30pm. Due to waiting till 11.30pm when the luggage began to flow miss my connecting flight to santiago at 11.45pm whilst finding out at 7am the following morning after a cracking night in the airport my suitcase and guitar are enjoying a night in Heathrow and will be on the next flight to Madrid and arrive at 2.30pm this afternoon (17th august). The great part in all this nonsense is that it’s my birthday tomorrow (Thu 18th august) and I will be on day 3 of my lovely holiday visiting my wives family in santiago still dealing with mongaloid tendencies in Madrid till 11.59pm when I finally get to chile. In fairness to Iberia I’ve been vouchered and given more flight time than the wright brothers would be proud of however I will 1 never use them again and 2. When I arrive back in Scotland on 31st of august be seeking a full refund plus Airbnb costs for 3 days, compensation for missing my birthday with my family and definitely be having a chat with the local papers back in Edinburgh.

I only made it to the connection flight because I shouted and begged hundreds of people to let me get ahead of the boarding control queue and after running 2 miles in 11 minutes and only because I was desperate to make that flight (which I had informed Iberia about) because my mother had just passed away and I had to get to my destination asap. Then, they lost my luggage and didn't care for one second how that would cause me issues and didn't send my suitcase until 5 days later (The day before I travelled back to UK)!

In the month leading up to our flight to Madrid, we did the responsible thing and paid to choose our seats ahead of time. Sounds easy, right? Well with Iberia's website it was a pain in the butt. My partner and I both received receipts of the transaction, but the website continued to show an alert that we HAD NOT booked our seats ahead of time. Strange, right? Well we made multiple calls to Iberia's customer service to resolve the issue. Each time, we had extremely rude encounters of people who said 1. this happens all the time (yikes), and 2. we could resolve it at the check-in counter at the airport, and 3. our paid seat choices would be honored. 

The day before the flight, we checked in after receiving the email saying we could. While going through the online check-in, the website suddenly said we had new seats (middle and separated). We called customer service once again, and they said 1. this happens all the time, and 2. we could resolve it at the check-in counter at the airport, and 3. our paid seat choices would be honored. 

You know where this is going... 

At the airport, after standing in an extremely long line for check in with other people with their own website frustrations, we were told our paid seat choices never went through (despite the charge) and the only seats available would be the back of the plane with no option to recline. I felt like we were being punished for doing the responsible things (paying to chose our seats and checking in 24 hrs before the flight). They wouldn't even offer us an upgrade, a refund, or free checked luggage. 

We were told we would be refund the charge for our seat choice... that still hasn't happened. 

On the return flight, the check-in counter did not print out our boarding passes for our connecting flight. Thankfully we were on top of things and were able to get it. The check-in counter said my request for a vegetarian meal was too late and I was suppose to request it 24 hrs in advance. I told her I had requested it a month ago with a customer service representative on the phone...

I showed him my connection flight pass and he finally printed my boarding pass but seemed like he was very unhappy to do it.

The next time we saw an attendant was to offer a """"snack"""" with less than an hour to go in the flight.  That left about 5 hours that someone could have cleaned up the food, or how about offering a drink during the flight.   This is the same attendant who banged into me everytime she came down that aisle.  For an airline that is so worried about covid, yes we had to wear a mask for the entire time regardless of vaccination status, you would think they would keep the airplane clean.  It was filthy going in and worse getting off because they don't consider cleanliness their job.  Oh and did I mention that I had to clean the toilet area before I could use it.  Disgusting.

My son has celiac so we entered a request online for Gluten Free meal, when we called later we were told you could only request at the gate during check in (at the check in told that we had to request this online well in advance), when on the plane we asked the attendant .if it was possible to get anything gluten free and they said we had to do that online, they then shoved my burnt possible in front of me saying it’s pasta (they were giving earlier passengers a choice but apparently had run out, then they shoved another plate into my sons spot and we had to raise our voice to pull it away from him as he would get very sick if he ate the ALL Gluten meal. Then at the Gate they did not have the space for everyone’s carry on so they stopped anyone with a carry on and had those family members who were not carrying the carry on go ahead.  They they grabbed our bags and said they were being checked (we didn’t want to check them because of the horror stories about Iberian Airline losing bags).  I was carrying my check in bag and that of my wife and son, because they were told to get on the plan already they said I had too many bags and tried to force me to pay for them because the other 2 passengers were no longer with me.  They also grabbed my daughters bag and checked it.  When we arrived in Chicago, we had to wait over an hour for bags to come out ( after a 11 hour flight and now in rush hour for our 6 hour drive home), all of my daughters souvenirs were smashed (she hadn’t planned on checking the bag so didn’t bubble wrap items).  On the flight the seats were uncomfortable (not as bad as Frontier Airlines but still bad).  Ohh the bathrooms, for a full plane 8 across and about 60 rows, 1 toilet was out of order, another toilet wouldn’t flush (no sign so just full of toilet paper etc) another toilet the sink didn’t work, 4th toilet barely flushed and was filled with toilet paper an unclean to sit on, we were not allowed to use the 2 business class toilets or the 2 toilets near the back which I think the attendants wanted to keep open and clean for themselves (yes on a very long flight).  No water or drinks except during the meals and attendants wouldn’t help you except to tell you to pull up your mask.  Also, they would not allow you to check in by going online so we tried calling in from a foreign country, after several attempts of people telling you different things (non worked), they told us we had to download the WhatsApp (apparently they rely on 3rd party apps to run their reservation system- but still didn’t work), they then said we would have to check in at the airport 4 hours before the flight.  No one at the Iberia counter the night before and no one came to the Iberia Airlines counter until 2 1/2 hours before the flight - so we are glad we got up at 3 AM to sit around an empty airport counter (all other airlines had people at their counter at 3 am and the night before).

During our transfer we were held up by staff members causing us to almost miss our flight. Iberia Airlines had an additional station to check our passports, which caused us to be late for boarding and separated our family as they took my brother and mother into a side room to be searched even though they had already gone through airplane security. It didn’t help either that the man checking our passports told us the wrong line to go to. Now I don’t know if this is procedure in that airport but it appeared that Iberia Airlines was the only Airlines adding on this extra passport check.
Now Iberia Airlines food I would say is good for airplane food when you actually get it.  My whole family has a gluten allergy and we called before hand to make sure we would be receiving gluten free food but however when dinner came around it turned out they ran out of gluten free meals by the time they reached my family, now we most likely think this was an error on the Flight attendant’s part as there was option between the pasta and the chicken, however she just didn’t go to the people with allergies first. This was also a problem on the flight to Madrid when they didn’t have any gluten free meals in stock.  In addition to low amount of food my family got for dinner, their other meal, excluding the snack, was all gluten resulting in my younger siblings going without food for the last five hours of the flight, which was hard for them.

We booked through American Airlines (and because I now know they are affiliated with Iberia, I will no longer be flying with American Airlines, even if their flights are the cheapest option). We booked our flight from Porto, Portugal to Chicago O'Hare. At Porto, the Iberia staff showed up so late that we all began to get worried. We got on our flight to Madrid where we were going to have a layover before flying home to Chicago. However, our flight was delayed by so long that by the time we got to Madrid, our flight to Chicago had left without us. We then expected an Iberia agent to come over and tell us that they had arranged another flight for us, but that did not happen. Reader: we spent three hours in Madrid asking Iberia agent after Iberia agent what we should do, and all we got was a few shrugs and vague pointing upwards, which we eventually realized meant to go upstairs to a customer service desk. We stood in line for about 45 minutes with everyone else who was stranded (including one gentleman who had been stranded for TWO DAYS). One of our party decided to go to our original gate downstairs just to check if any agent was there. He then called us saying the gate agent said we could get on the flight to Boston which would then go to Chicago! 

Indeed, we got on the flight to Boston, but our bags were gate checked (this is the last time we ever saw them). That flight to Boston was also delayed enough that we missed our connection to Chicago. We did go by baggage claim to see if our luggage was there, and weirdly ours was not but our friends' were. There were no Iberia agents to be found to discuss our problem with, and the American Airlines agent told us the only flight they could get us on was the next morning. For family reasons, this was unacceptable, so we ended up purchasing direct, one-way tickets home. I won't go into this bit anymore, but every single flight that day was delayed, but United (who we flew with at the end) actually helped us and even held a flight for us. 

The next morning, I started calling Iberia about our luggage which is part 2 of this never ending saga. We never got any call directly from Iberia that our luggage was located or would be sent to us. Any communication has been entirely one-sided. Over the last two months, I've called Iberia about once a week or more, and have received conflicting information. Even with my luggage tag, they can't seem to find our bags. I've been told our bags will be mailed to us, I've been told they were in Chicago (they weren't, I drove there to check), I've been told to email Iberia.com with my information (which is hilarious because that's a website and not an email), I've been told case number only to have it not work online, I've been told I would hear follow up information about out bags in five minutes and never heard back, I've told at least fifteen different people my baggage tag number and described the contents of our luggage in-depth, but to no avail. Essentially, it's beginning to look like Iberia has lost our bags completely and is making it impossible to receive compensation, simply because there is no clear path to requesting compensation. 

So, if you're reading this and wondering if you should book with Iberia or American... don't. And if you're Iberia, I'd love to hear from you. You have my email, my phone number, my baggage tag, my flight confirmation number, my ticket number, and at this point part of my soul."

The employees with this airline seem to not care. Checkin opens two hours before your flight and they’ll stand there doing nothing until that mark.

We were delayed 90 minutes flying out of Boston. When we got to Madrid we needed to run to our connecting flight. Didn’t get to take advantage of that priority boarding I paid extra for!

Coming home was an absolute mess. Published guidance says be at the airport at least 3 hours before your flight; we got there 4 hours early to be safe. After standing in line for an hour an Iberia employee walked through the line and made anyone not on the very next flight get out of the line.

We watched every other airline efficiently check passengers in. Iberia couldn’t seem to figure out how to get out of its own way.

Online checkin doesn’t work, the app doesn’t work and virtually everyone leaving Lisbon had some kind of issue. My wife and I checked in at the same time and were given two different boarding groups!

This was within the first hour so clearly the plane had not been cleaned prior to our arrival. In general the whole plane was dirty. It was completely squashed and uncomfortable in our seats. Staff were incredibly rude to all passengers throughout the flight. They made passages feel very uncomfortable asking for extra drinks like water which was shocking on a long haul flight.

The rude gate attendant told me that counted as a “bag” and therefore she had to check k in my carryon. She literally grabbed my roll on even as I explained my bag was just food for medical reasons. Nope…she didn’t budge and was about to check my bag when I told her absolutely not, since I had read the horror stories of lost luggage. I just left all our food  behind.
Of course there wasn’t enough overhead space for everyone’s bags so folks were forced to Check bags anyway (not us). They didn’t offer any movies or entertainment unless you wanted to pay for Wi-Fi on your personal device. The seats were so small you couldn’t move (and I’m a small person). The seats didn’t recline. The USB port under my seat didn’t work so my phone died. They dont serve any food or snacks or WATER unless you pay for  them. Yes, even water.

The 4 bags had my dress (mother of the bride), my other daughter's bridesmaid dress and our three granddaughters' flower girl dresses, tiaras, veils and gloves, as well as many other valuables. Those things will never be work/used.  I waited in line for hours at the airport when we arrived to make a claim because hundreds of other passengers on Iberia lost their luggage, too.  After making my claim, I called the airline baggage claim every single day, several times a day, hoping to find out something before the wedding, which wouldn't occur until 7 days later. They had 7 days to locate our bags. THEY NEVER EVEN LOCATED THE BAGS DURING THAT 7 DAYS.  We told them they were at JFK, we KNEW American Airline had delivered them to Iberia in JFK.  They nevertheless had NO INFORMATION about where our bags  could be. They said they would text or email me when they found out something. Sometimes when I called, they would have new information, but I never received an email or text about it. That information was sometimes confirmed by other agents, other times the agent said they could not see anything similar in the records. It was like they were looking at different information.  I told the agents many times, if they didn't find the bags by the wedding day, forget it, just return them to my address in the US. Guess what?  They DELIVERED the bags to BARCELONA the day AFTER THE WEDDING!  We gave them local Barcelona address and phone number SEVERAL TIMES. However, they never had a record of those whenever I called back. They ended up couriering a bag to my daughter's apartment in Barcelona, but never bothered to email or call to tell us it was coming, or to arrange for the delivery. She lives in an apartment - SHE NEEDED TO BE THERE WHEN THEY ARRIVED.  They just showed up, unannounced, and when she didn't answer the buzzer, they left and said they would not re-deliver it. So they expected her to just sit in her apartment day after day awaiting the delivery of bags that we were never told arrived.  She works, so she ended up having to pay someone to go pick up the bag from the airport. In the meantime, the other 3 bags, which we were told would be at the airport for identification purposes when the hired person showed up - were not there when the hired person showed up. This was five days ago. I have never received an email or text message about the whereabouts of my bags. I don't know where my US bound bags are.

The woman at the desk yelled at my husband and told him he could not check us in until 2 hours before, so we waited. We got to check in, exactly 2 hours prior to boarding, we were told we could not sit together, as we were the LAST to check in, and the only 2 seats left were 11 rows apart.

So far, I have avoided Covid, and I pray that’ll still be the case. 

My meal: There was, supposedly, a choice between chicken and pasta. I do not eat pasta. They never gave me a choice. My sense of it is that they had way more of their version of pasta than chicken, and ran out if it before they got to the 3rd row in the middle section.  I wanted water with my meal and was given a small cup with about 4 ounces of water. This is inadequate for an almost 8 hour flight. Luckily, I had a bottle of water with me.  Again, resigned to just eating the meal, as I had no choice, I started, but stopped after the first bite. I absolutely could  not eat this particular version of it: it was laced with hot pepper sauce. My system doesn’t tolerated jalapeños. I ate the roll, the tiny amount of salad, and cake. Luckily, I had bought a nice sandwich in the airport for lunch and had half of it left, so I had food, but what if I hadn’t?

I originally purchased my ticket via Expedia. I was given voucher for 1 checked bag & Iberia did not honor it. I was charged $75 vs the $64 they charge on the app. Then, I board the plane, everything was fine until after they provided dinner, I asked for water and it seemed as if the stewardess didn't want to give it to me. It took at least 10 minutes to receive the water.
Arriving to Madrid, I had a layover. My connecting flight boarding time was at 7:05AM. We landed in Madrid @ 6:30AM, you have to go through customs!
The security at customs was rude, she was inconsiderate. She made me miss the connecting flight. You'd think Iberia would accommodate and put me on the next flight for 8:30AM. Iberia put me on standby until 3:50PM flight. 
I was fighting for my life to get on the 3PM flight, i was traveling by myself and it wasn't my fault i missed the connecting flight. That's another thing about Iberia, any time you spoke with a customer service representative at the airport, the first thing they do is point the finger at YOU! """"It's not our fault, it's your fault"""". No one wanted to speak English when they spoke it very well. This is all in Madrid, they're home base! 
It's an inconvenience on Iberia's part. Since, we landed 30 minutes before the connecting flight, knowing travelers have to go through customs ! I didn't understand why I wasn't called to board on the 8:30 am flight when i was one of the first persons to be on standby. There was a lot of people who missed the connecting flight. What Iberia does is, they over book flights and don't assign seats, even for purchased tickets. Super inconvenient. 
In the end, coming home to the USA was another fight for my life. The app never updated passengers to confirm delayed flight, to pay for luggage the app wasn't working, i had to get my receipt and confirmation at the gate, i arrived 5 hours before departure time,  there's only 1 person working at the gate. Iberia customer service rep stated if the departure time is passed, your flight was either canceled or delayed, it interfered with our connecting flight MADRID to JFK.

8.26008892059326,7.23534965515137,"Iberia Flight Delays",2,"I read the other reviews and chuckled and had to add our experience in solidarity with other travelers. Our family took our first (and possibly last) trip  with  Iberia through codeshare with American Airlines.  Last year we flew to Madrid on Delta without issue, piece of cake connection in JFK.  Earlier this year we traveled to Paris on United which was wonderful.  This time we chose American/ Iberia because it was really the only way to get to and from Sevilla and Jerez on the return in one day.   I usually avoid codeshare flights but we felt the risk was worth it. I also know airline workers are having a hard time right now. 

1. Connecting in JFK from American to Iberia is challenging.  Signage is poor (that is partly on American Airlines who simply has banners on stands in random places in the terminal saying Madrid flights depart out of terminal 7 without further information of how to get there).  Unclear how to get to terminal 7.  I stopped a random flight attendant in the terminal and she sighed and said you don't have much time and explained to me the process.  Must exit American terminal, take a train, try to find Iberia check in desk in terminal 7 (its literally behind the wall of the other airlines in a corner that you cannot see from the the main lobby), and then repeat TSA security.  The Iberia check in agent said you have 25 minutes to go through security and get to the flight and you better not miss it because we don't have any open seats to Madrid for days.  
2. Luggage delayed on arrival for one family member for 3 days.  We missed phone call for delivery of luggage and when calling back 10 minutes later they said the driver just left 5 minutes ago and will try again tomorrow.  I would recommend putting an AirTag in luggage so it can be traced if flying Iberia.  
3. The Iberia Express plane has seats so close when passenger in front reclined her seat I could practically perform dental work on her. The passenger was almost lying in my lap.  They cram over 220 people on an Airbus A321, American puts 180 on their version. 
4. The Iberia Express flight back to Madrid was literally taxing onto the runway and passengers were still trying to cram luggage overhead and trying to determine who is sitting where and standing in the aisles as we were about to take off. 
5. Connection time from Iberia Express to Iberia in Madrid took 1.5 hours to get from Terminal T4 to T4S where mainline flights depart, causing us to nearly miss our connecting flight home from Madrid.  Very crowded, down multiple escalators several floors, taking a train for a 5-10 minute ride, then up 3 escalators, on last escalator there were too many people at the top so they turned it off and blocked us from going up, causing 10-15 minute delay, then waiting in long line for passport control, then walking another 5-10 minutes to gate, then having passport evaluated again in front of gate. People were freaking out they were missing their flights as we stood in line after line.  
6. Iberia from Madrid to SFO is a long 12.5 hour flight.  The flight attendants provided lunch and drinks and cleaned up and then literally disappeared for 8-9 hours.  I saw some passengers with boxes of food and drinks.  Apparently, the galley operates as a snack bar, where passengers just go and request food and drinks.  No announcement about this was made.  Those in the know, apparently know to do this.  We were so thirsty and hadn't had any time to buy any water in Madrid that I finally got up to see what was happening in the galley, and the flight attendant was sitting in a chair -  a lawn chair - in the galley.  She did provide 2 glasses of water but no offer of a snack box.  
7. The lavatory on the newer A330 was very dirty, the floor was wet and there were bits of towels and toilet paper all over the floor and the sink.  I've never seen anything like it on any plane before.
8. I am having to change my teenager's return flight home who is still there on an educational visit because the connection time will be too short on the return (it is less than 1.5 hours in Madrid).  I am having to pay over $1000 fare difference to do this with American Airlines because they are selling flights with connections that are simply not doable and we did not know any better when booking.  
9. The Iberia seat selection on their website is glitchy.  

So in summary, Iberia got us there and back safely so that is great, but the quality of the experience was lacking.  If you know this going in, and are able to pad your connections (at least 3 hours), and can bring your own food and water to supplement what they provide, and enjoy quirks, then Iberia may be alright."

  > We got in to Madrid from Lisbon after 55 minutes of flight
  > Our connecting flight is about 1 hr and we thought that was plenty of time, Noooo
  > We had to walk/run far to terminal S, then catch a tram that takes you to another terminal

  > We got through immigration, the sign to our gate (49) says 7 mins

The seating installed in economy class in the A350 used for this 12-hour flight has been designed for much smaller creatures than reasonably slim adult humans, and is both too narrow and too close to the seat in front. What's more, the cabin service was terrible. The meal was barely edible and the drinks service was non-existent. No snacks were available from the galley, and the crew - while polite - were a million miles from the helpful, accommodating crew that you meet on airlines such as Emirates.

I was queuing at the gate with my boyfriend, carrying my hand luggage, which was - as expressely stated both on my ticket and my boarding pass - included, when a woman wearing a doubtful uniform (not an hostess' nor a security's one, just an anonimous red polo shirt with a small Iberia logo on the chest) without saying a word came towards me and tried to attach a label on my luggage. I speak very little spanish, but out of kindness, after gesturing her to stop with my hand, I asked her in spanish why she was doing that. She shouted at me in a very unpolite manner that it was the company's policy and tried again to touch my luggage without my permission. I gestured her again to stop and started to explaining her in english, since I was not able to do that in spanish, that on the ticket I paid for was clearly written that I could take a luggage of that size with me on the plane and that, therefore, I had put in there fragile things and medications I needed for my health condition. After a couple of words she stopped me, again in a very rude way, and shouted at me in spanish that she did not speak english, then tried again to attach the label to my luggage. I then felt very insulted for such a disrespectful behaviour, grabbed the label and threw it to the ground, stating in english that I would not let her touch and take away my personal belongings without an explanation. At this point, she made an incredible scene, shouting and gesturing that I had hit her, insulting both me and my boyfriend and then running behind the gate desk. I tried to follow her, wanting to apologize for having thrown away the label (of course without touching her) and to show her my ticket in the attempt, one more time, to receive an explanation, but another woman got in the way and started to make a scene herself, shouting that I hit her collegue, that they were denying boarding to both me and my boyfriend and that they were going to call the police to arrest me. I was simply shocked, because in so many years travelling around the world with so many different companies nothing like this had never occured to me, neither I had never witnessed to something like this. Since the woman talking to me could not have seen what had happened between me and her collegue, my boyfriend tried to explain to her that I did not touch her collegue, but just grabbed the label. At this point, that woman also ran away behind the gate desk, keep shouting in front of all the other passengers queuing that we were not going to board and I was going to get arrested by the police. We then waited for the police, while the gate remained closed, but they never came. Instead, after a while a man approached us, asking us what had happened. My boyfriend and I explained everything to him and said that we were ready to look at the security cameras, if he did not believe us. He was very kind and in a very good english explained to us that we were going to board with no problem and that, being that particular aircraft very small, no trolleys were allowed on board. I said that in that case I would leave my luggage with no problem, but we pointed out that the woman did not go on attaching labels to other passengers' luggages. Very embarassed, he stated that she was probably choosing arbitrarily which ones to label and then gave dispositions to the hostesses to label all the passengers' hand luggages. So they did and let us board with no problem, while the two women who attacked us had go away. What can I say? I usually never complain when I am not satisfied with a service, because I understand yours is a stressful and difficult job and, being a worker myself, I know that we all can have a bad day, but this was definitely too much. It was a nightmare experience, which left me nervous and unwell for all the flight, and I think I will never fly again with you, fearing that something similar may happen again."

After waiting about an hour in a customer service line, I was  a given a connecting flight NINE HOURS LATER. The consolation prize was a meal ticket for a """"restaurant"""" in Madrid, which turned out to be a third-rate cafeteria.

Told at check in if we wanted to put any hand luggage in the hold we could free of charge.There were 9 of us including 2 x 6 month old twins. We decided to put most in the hold and kept 3 of which one had the babies milk, nappies etc in, the others had snacks ,ipads etc. When we attempted to board was told very abruptly we cannot take any on plane as no space. We tried to argue but to no avail. Fortunately a lady at another desk said she would allow the babies case. We then had to carry all ipads etc in our hands as no bag to carry on place. Prior to boarding had an issue at customs as at check in had produced an extra boarding pass. This caused a few problems as was a security breach. The worst was still to come. We boarded the plane and someone was in our seats . We had booked 2 rows behind each other as we could only have 1 baby in each row due to drop down masks. The family said they had been moved as they had a baby and their row had only 3 masks. The hostess then said why do we need these seats so was told we have 2 babies. She proceeded to sit 2 adults and 2 babies on same row leaving middle seat empty. This obviously left 1 of our group with no seat. They constantly asked him to sit down and he told them I would if I had a seat. The reply the plane is full, no more available seats. We asked why can they not find another row with 4 masks and ask people to move so can go back to original 1 baby on row but no one listened until we had to get very annoyed so they called the captain who agreed with us that was the solution. We had left double buggy at entrance to plane and when arrived in Madrid were told it would be on the belt with luggage. After waiting about an hour we had to queue again for another hour at Iberia enquiry desk. they couldnt locate it so we were frantic in Madrid with 2 very tired babies by this time and no where to sleep.Eventually we spoke to another security guard who suggested we try excess baggage and thank goodness it was there.

Least legroom I have seen in an airline in a long time and horribly uncomfortable seats. No ability to change flights even if you purchase insurance. They try to up charge you at every chance they get.

Just deplorable. 2+ hours in check-in line and almost missed my flight despite arriving 3+ hours early.

I heard the crew accuse a passenger with a medical exemption certificate of forgery and making it all up. I could not believe how they were treating passengers. The shouting and barking orders at us as if we were in some military boot camp, and not paying customers. Absolutely awful and disgusting behaviour
Their announcements were mostly in Spanish, and then they switch to English. It would have been better if they didnt, as their English is appalling. You cannot understand a word they are saying, and makes me worry what they would do in an emergency
During meal service, the crew manager would walk up and down the aisle and tell us to hurry up and eat fast so we can put our masks back on. I have never been so disgusted with airline staff

Let‘s start from the beginning: The website, I don‘t know what the f*** was happening but it didn‘t work for hours and we had to try different devices at home to finally get it.. (Considering doing the whole booking, the e-ticket, check-in.. it made it very tiring  und we kinda lost patience.) The baggage check-in at the airport… The system, ONLY Iberias system didn’t work out of the whole universe..The had to check-in manually and it took FOREVER. People got pi**ed , we were at least patient but the flight delayed 1h , but we made it to the connection flight. Then the seats, we booked row 27 (according to the plan those were two seats behind the bathroom with extra legroom. We paid 200 CHF for those seats and didn‘t get them!!! It was a different airplan and everything was very narrow. On the way back also not, but there at least we were lucky to have again an other airplane that was a little bit more comfortable, but still not the seats we booked and paid for. 
The service was ok… During the shourt flights there was no food, never had that with other airlines .. I expected at least a small snack. On the long flights the food was also ok BUT: If you fligh 8.5h hours and you get food at the very beginning of the flight, aren‘t you hungry again after 7h? For the second meal we got to choose beteeen a banana and a muffin haha omg.. Drinks could also have been brought more often .. not only twice. We had to stand up and ask for it, since we had already drank our own bottles of water.

On the 13-hour MAD-EZE Atlantic crossing, Iberia was flying EC-NBR (first flight May 2019), a A359 in 1-2-1 configuration. Seating in C-class is a flatbed seat with 78 Bed-length (1981mm) and 26 Width. The aircraft is top-of-the-bill.

The flight was on time. With a number of flights for South America leaving at midnight the lounge in MAD appeared crowded. Entertainment on the board is fine with large screen, a pillow, blanket and no under-blanket. To our surprise in C-Class no voucher for internet use is offered. You have to buy internet for use on the flight.

Service was friendly but not very attentive. The purser hardly mastered English and her announcements in English were incomprehensible. At 00:40 dinner was served. We skipped dinner and went to sleep. To be fair, this is what we need. An OK sleep on a 10.000km flight is more important than a posh late dinner plus drinks.

Food on the Madrid - Quito leg was OK, but nothing to write home about, I would have been seriously unhappy if I had paid some of the prices that were quoted (we got a bargain price which I am sure was a mistake).  Quito - Madrid food was awful, the beef was as tough as old boots.  We ere on a BA operated flight for Madrid - London and the offering was the best of all the flights.

Coming to the check in counter, the lady said we are too late I had to do the check-in 45min prior to my flight so let’s do the math: Arrival 6:55pm the flight was at 7.55pm that’s exactly 1hour and we wanted to check-in at 7.05pm which still gave me 50mins to be on time and wait for the boarding! But unfortunately they insisted that I was too late! Then they told my boyfriend due to the fact that my spanish isn’t that great, that I could go through security with my luggage and tell them I couldn’t board, so they will put it in under the airplane and give it to me once we landed in Zurich!

I purchased a ticket on their website that was listed in Euro (112.6 Euro), but then got the receipt, which was in pound (112.6 Sterling).  I am from the USA and that resulted in approximately $20 difference.  Twenty dollars was not much to get worked up about, but it was so absurd that I had to call.   After much back on forth with representative, I was told I would be credited the difference.  However, when I got my credit card bill a month later, I realized that the representative had actually given me a credit for 112.6 Euro.  That drove me to the website to see if I still had my ticket.  Sure enough, my booking no longer existed.   So basically I ending up paying $20 to not have a ticket and by this time tickets had almost doubled in price.  At this point, I have spent hours on the phone trying to get this issue resolved.  Even if the mistake is so obvious, the customer representatives have resisted doing anything about it.  Finally, after much nagging, they agreed to look further into it and get back to me in a week.  In the meantime, no ticket.   A fiction writer could not have come up with a more bizarre set of circumstances.   Finally, I just bought another ticket since otherwise I would be stranded and hope they will reimburse me back to original price plus the $20 difference.  We will have to see…….

He refused to ID himself. Then I tried to read his name from his ID badge, he suddenly grabbed his ID badge didn’t let me see his name. I was on the phone to customer service the whole time and I explained that the pilot is refusing to show me his ID. Then the pilot stood in front of the exit door and told me he’s going to call the police. He didn’t let me to exit the airplane! I told him i am on the phone to customer service and they are asking me your name it’s not like I’ve done something wrong or it’s illegal to ask someone for verification. This pilot needs to be sacked for many reasons. First of all for refusing to verify himself. Secondly to put people lives at risk, and finally for damaging the airplane and destroying the reputation of the company. I could only see pilot first name and it was Enrique.

And please do share this with as many people as you can, especially if you have a dog and Babys travelling with you. I have posted this  on as many social media platforms as I could hoping that no one has to go through what we went through yesterday. 

We have been loyal members of Iberia. We always  booked flights with them, even most of the flights are being routed to Madrid first before going to the final destination. Like Bilbao-Madrid-Lisbon, instead of booking Bilbao-Lisbon with a cheaper alternative. We just loved their service and their always on time flights. Until yesterday.... We are now cancelling our credit cards we have with them and our membership as well. Good bye Avios, welcome Miles and More...

So what happened was this: we flew more than once with our dog. So we knew the procedure. You book a flight, you make a call and they ask you to call back 72hrs later. It sounds weird that it takes this long, but it always worked and we thought this is just how things are handled at Iberia. So we called on Monday 27th (flight was booked on the 24th, but we couldnt reach the hotline, which is normal cause it was christimas and decided to call on Monday the 27th instead). We spoke to a nice lady who helped us make the request- they ask you a bunch of questions about the dog, weight race etc. Then basically, they ask you to call back again three days later. Not earlier. Business as usual we thought. In case they would have told us on Thursday the  30th that the dog couldnt be on the plane, we still would have had time to reschedule the flight and just try another flight... 

So we called again on Thursday and to our surprise, we were told there is no request for a dog... 

After discussing this with the call center agent, she decided to make another request. I told her the flight was the next day. And she told me there is nothing else she could do and that we should try it. I dont get why she wasnt honest and just told us to rebook??! Both of these calls were recorded! So we have proof!

When we arrived at the airport in Bilbao, the lady at the counter told us she can see the request and they could handle the dog in cargo BUT there needs to be at least one hour between the connecting flights. We only had 55minutes. Iberia seems to need this additional 5 minutes, which are of course are essential!, to transport the dog from one plane to another. Why did the customer service representative did not tell us that???!!! I DONT GET IT!!! 

Instead, we were insulted by everyone possible at the airport, especially from the supervisor lady at the Airport in Bilbao, who kept saying we never called on Monday- I LOVED IT!! CALLING BUSINESS CLIENTS LIARS- WONDERFUL JOB! I asked for her name, and she told me she wouldnt give me her name and turned around her name tag :) And kept running away when we tried to talk cause I think she noticed we tried to record her with our phones... which we did of course. 

On top of that, we got 3999 new informations on how to handle bookings with a dog- all of the Iberia workers saying different things. One said they need notice 24hrs, the other 48hrs etc etc. We didnt know if we should laugh or cry. 
It was my husbands birthday and we drove home- PAYING OURSELVES FOR A RENTAL CAR!!!!- crying during the whole ride. 

You guys think this is all??? NO! Iberia told us we have to pay 90EUR cancellation fees... so on top of all that, we will not receive the full amount back. 

This company is calling loyal customers liars, charge them and insult them! 

Not acceptable. We are in touch with various companies, one of them airclaim, to see if we can get back those 90EUR and the money we paid for the rental car. We have cancelled our credit cards with them, told everyone to avoid them, especially family and friends on every channel possible, and will also cancel our Silver membership.

The flight did not cost the total amount I had in my code, which I was going to use to book some seats as I'm 198cm myself and these planes are tuna cans. To my surprise, check-in is done on Vueling which means that my whole plan went to the garbage as the codes and money I have sitting on Iberia cannot be used on Vueling.

Trying to fix this issue with customer support, I call once Iberia Express getting hung up by the automatic answers without speaking to a real person, the same result after calling Iberia customer support and 5min on the phone waiting for nothing. After this, I decided to try the WhatsApp chat, which take me 10 min to make the automatic answers formulary to understand my problem, and when I finally get a real person on my chat, I get as an answer one line saying: """"the code can only be used on Iberia"""". They never answer again or say anything else, I was so angry that I deleted the chat to do not remember that ever happened.

They find that the Iberia agent booked me on the Madrid to Miami flight, but booked my wife on British Airways from Madrid to London!!!  AA had to cancel the entire reservation and re-book us, which meant that we lost the seats we had upgraded to.  Got back in line and back to the agent who now found the new reservation and gave us our boarding passes in economy...fine at least we will get home.   10 hours later we arrive in Miami (thursday night) and guess what, two of our four bags don't show up!!

To make matters worse the luggage contained kitesurfing equipment and vital medication amongst other things, meaning that I am having to pay $95/day as well as a large fee for replacement medicine. I have been offered no compensation and the representative at the airport doesn't respond to my emails or phone calls despite giving me his direct phone number. I would advise anyone to not chose to travel with Iberia, this situation has been horrendous. I hope that they can rectify the situation ASAP, I would love to hear from a representative from Iberia to try and receive clarity on where and when I will receive my bag

I also require extra luggage and even squeezed in upgrade to Business class. So turned out I needed to change return date as this is what I paid for while out on my dream holiday. This is where is gets ugly.

Rang the local Iberia number in the DR, only to be told, no evidence of change of flight. I rang repeatedly and spent at least £15 on calls. Was given an email address by numerous staff, to show my receipt of purchase none of which worked as they all bounced back.  Eventually I gave up and spent another £30 on international calls to to get my option to change my fight. They then gave me a date I didn't want. So I swallowed the pain of spending all that money to get this actioned. Not only are the staff useless, the systems tie their hands to their backs, making the passengers suffer. 
On return, after printing my boarding pass I noticed my extra luggage was missing. I had to call back with disgust only for them to tell me they cant see it on their systems. eventually the staff dropped the phone on me again and had to call back and was told to hold. Waited 10 minutes before I could eventually spend another 17 minutes to pay for a service I already had paid for. 

Never again, I emailed customer service about my experience and got a template letter for my efforts, the case was closed. Once I get home, I am deleting all Iberia marketing, apps and any trace of this company. I am scarred for life. They will never see my money again. Stay away.

11/19-26

Let me preface my remarks that we are a septuagenarian couple who have traveled extensively to Europe for over 30 years.  This trip was our high school senior grandson’s which allows us a week of one-on-one time with him. 

We booked our trip through Costco Travel; our first time to do so.  The trip included flights to Madrid, Spain, a high speed train to Barcelona, and the flight back to the US with hotel and transfer to and from the airport.  In addition via Tripadvisor/Viator we booked some excursions: HoponHopoff bus in Madrid and Avila and Segopvia, the Prada Museum and Royal Palace; and Montserrat and Sagrada Familia in Barcelona. 

We flew with American Airlines to JFK in New York and there via American Airlines we flew Iberia Airlines to Madrid.  We typically fly Premium Economy on the long flights to allow us to sleep on the way over.  However, due to an error on both our parts, we only received upgraded economy which is only a little more leg room.  Uncomfortable seating, etc.  For those who fly you know the drill.  

Our Iberia departure was a 1 hour delay with a half-hour delayed arrival.  Nothing unusual but remember we booked hotel transfers.  After we arrived we waited about 45 minutes for our luggage to find our luggage was lost!  We asked and was guided to the Iberia customer service center and arrived to a relatively short line.   There were about 4 agents handling the customers. 

I was concerned about our driver so I went to make sure he was there and explained our luggage was lost and I had to fill our the forms, etc.  My wife and grandson stayed with him while I returned to Iberia customer service.  It took me an HOUR to get to the customer service representative and another half hour to fill out the paperwork.  I explained that our cold weather clothes were in our suitcases and we would need to purchase some clothing, etc.  To my dismay he gave me a print out with a telephone number to call...TOMORROW!  That they would not provide any vouchers, etc until tomorrow!!  Perhaps customer service but certainly NOT customer care.  In addition our driver demanded 60 euros cash for his time. Uuggh.  

So instead off getting on the HOHO bus we trotted to stores to get coats, hats, toiletries, etc.  It was so late by then the museums, etc were closing and the HOHO bus stopped at 6 pm. 

We stayed at the NH Collection Suecia in Madrid.  It was very nice, great location,  and the staff very helpful and helped direct us to some stores to buy clothes, etc.  While we speak a little Spanish (Our grandson had taken 3 years of Spanish and was a great help) we certainly are not fluent.  I called the number given me by Iberia customer service to see if there were any updates.  I had received a text message that they had located our luggage and it was being sent to the airport.  Where it went before we never found out.   I called the number and listened to a Spanish recording, but it was so fast I couldn’t understand nor could our grandson.  I was listening for an English option but there was none.  Regardless, we felt our luggage would arrive the next day; little did we know it would not. 

The next morning we went to catch the HOHO bus near the hotel.  We waited, and waited some more.  No bus.  We finally decided to walk, in the cold to the Prada. It is a great museum; overwhelming in fact.   You can not go wrong going there but plan for a lot of time.  We could have easily spent the whole day there and still not have seen it all. 

We then went to the HOHO stop right beside the Prada.  We waited and waited some more. No bus. We even asked several personnel near the museum and they all said that is where it stops.  I noticed a HOHO bus stop near by but never made it to our stop.  So we trekked over to that stop and waited and waited some more.  FYI, we learned that they had changed their schedule but never notified us nor did they post any signs at the stops. Even the kiosks which sell the HOHO tickets didn’t know!!  Anyway, while we have always used the HOHO to get around cities, etc. these were worthless.  They even stopped the buses going to some of the major attractions in Madrid such as the Royal Palace!  A total waste of TIME and money.  The time was the greatest loss. We did use the HOHO bus to get near the Royal Palace but that was the only time.  We never even toured the whole route.

The Royal Palace is fabulous and again well worth a visit. Don’t miss the armory though; it too is fabulous.  Although you can’t take pictures in most of the Palace they have a great book in the store, Royal Palace of Madrid.  It is well worth purchasing.  It is at the Royal Palace HOHO stop that we found out(after about 30 minutes) they had eliminated several stops including this one.  ???unbelievable. So we used Uber and taxis the rest of our stay. They were quick to respond and relatively inexpensive, certainly not as inexpensive as the HOHO bus or public transportation.  Note: we often use public transportation when we travel but with such a short time we wanted to maximize our time and waiting for buses or metros was considered to time consuming.  In hindsight we would have been better off to use it.

After the Palace we returned to our hotel with the expectation our luggage would be there. It wasn’t.  I asked the concierge to call for me and ask where our luggage was and about reimbursement for our clothes, etc.  He was able to determine that our luggage was in Madrid and would probably arrive that evening; but nothing on the reimbursement.  Note that we had received no such information via text from Iberia.  So we went to dinner and had a nice evening.  Getting back to the hotel we found...no luggage.  This proved to be very problematic as we had no time to go buy any additional clothing. 

The next day we had our excursion to  Ávila and Segovia.  As we traveled by bus we noticed the outside temperature drop from 9 C to 0 C.  When we arrive at Avila it was actually snowing, which normally would be a delight, but with the clothing we had we were freezing, especially my wife.  The tour was great and we highly recommend it.  Our guide was fabulous...am I using that too much? But she was.  We had a great lunch in Avila; I had their famous large bean soup; highly recommended. 

Afterwards we traveled to Segovia and I decided to give my wife some of my clothing and I stayed behind.  I had some nice cups of tea at a local cafe but I would have rather been on the tour. My wife and grandson did have a wonderful time again.  Again our guide was fabulous.  While I was at the cafe I called the hotel about our luggage and eureka it had arrived!  Since we were leaving the next day for Barcelona it was very important to us.  However, once again nothing about reimbursement from Iberia or any text message that they had delivered our luggage.  Extremely poor customer service and certainly no customer care at all.   

The next day we departed the hotel to take the high speed train to Barcelona.  Everything was very easy; easy to get to the station, easy to locate the gate, easy to find our car and seats thanks to the staff.  Ride was very nice with some nice scenery including snow on the ground!  We had lunch on board and just had a very nice trip.  My only complaint is that we wanted to leave early to arrive in Barcelona in time to visit some sites.  As it was we departed at 1 pm and arrived about 4 pm.  By the time we arrived at the hotel the day was pretty lost. 

We stayed at the NH Collection Podium, again a very nice hotel and location.  The next day we strolled Las Ramblas in the misty rain; but later as we walked the Rambla de Catalunya
and the Gothic Quarter it began to rain hard!  By the time we arrived back at the hotel we were soaked!  Fortunately we had our luggage and was able to change.  We met that evening with a pastor friend and had dinner and attended his church.  It was a great way to spend an evening. 

The next day we traveled to Montserrat leaving with Explore Catalunya.  Our guide Robert was great or should I say fabulous. They were well organized and allowed us some free time.  If you’ve never been to Montserrat(we actually had) it is really quite incredible.  We took the funicular to the top of the mountain as well as walked to the Cross of Saint Michael.  Afterward we headed to the Sagrada Familia.  It had been several years since we had visited and they have accomplished a lot.  It is due to be completed in 2026.  Again, fabulous.  It is so extraordinary that someone could have such a vision yet alone have it constructed.  Just beautiful and wrought with symbolism.

The next day we left to return to the US via American Airlines.  Due to some mixup again we had what they said were premium economy seats but not what I had hoped for.  We managed and the flight was uneventful; customs and passport control were easy(we have GOES). Our luggage had arrived –eureka and was easily rechecked to our home destination.  Our only complaint was the 7 hour layover in Miami.  But even after booking I looked for options and there really were none. 

All in all, a week with our grandson was priceless and worth any aggravations that occurred.  I am sure he will remember it all his life --- unfortunately the good and the bad. 

It will be interesting to see how Iberia and perhaps American Airlines responds as I will copy them on the letter as well."

As we had a long trip, and short holiday time, we paid a bit extra for a flight with good short connections (as we had to take 3 planes). The flight was cancelled and our only option was another trip with over 15h airport waiting time (but the price was the same as the previous flight).
2. As they messed-up the flight, I couldn't check-in before getting to the airport, so my husband and I had to take separate seats, as they told us there were no 2 seats next to each other available.
3. I also couldn't book my vegetarian meal in advance - so I couldn't really have breakfast, as it was covered in ham.
4. At the plane nobody wanted to change seats, so my husband and I couldn't stay together (which is ok, happens...). Surprisingly, there were 4 seats in a row available just next to us (so ppl in the check-in must have lied before). But we were told we could not move there, as the flight attendants had just reserved for another couple that asked - yes - the 4 seats.
5. At my seat, I found out it was broken and it wouldn't recline even one milimiter - quite something for an 8+ hour flight.
6. A luckier guy seating in front of me could recline all the way, and moved quite a lot while everyone was having theirs meals - which was the cherry on top: a full glass of water ended up on my pants."

I enter the flight and ask two attendants if it would be possible to take my bag back, they both replied with horrible excuses like the cabins are full, the bags already gone to check-in(even though people were waiting behind me). I proceed to find my seat and low and behold the cabin above my seat is empty and the one across from me too except for one suitcase, the cherry on top, it’s the suitcase of the couple that was in front of me. They then had multiple passengers from different seats place their bags above me and when I confronted them about the cabins being empty the flight attendant couldn’t look me in the eye, huffed at me, said there’s nothing she can do and left."

The check in process was absolutely chaotic. Limited staff to help. The majority of your customers including us were confused about where to queue and how to check in. We had already checked in online so went straight to the desk and after waiting 1 hour to arrive to the bag drop we were told we needed to use the machines to print the baggage ticket.  We went to use the machines and had to queue another 30 minutes, the machine would not accept my ticket and kept telling me I had to pay 60€ to check in my bag and error messages. After approaching a staff member for help he shouted at me and told me he was busy and to sort it out myself. I ended up having to queue again at the customer service desk which is right in the middle of all the check in machines, social distancing impossible, people pushing and getting irate. such a small area for the amount of passengers you are handling.

First of all, if you’re flying with the express airline of Iberia, then good luck trying to speak to anyone unless you’re in Spain and happen to be Spanish. 
The Iberia customer agents don’t seem to have any understanding about their own policies nor the policies of their express airlines service.

I booked a flight with Iberia express as I wanted to take my small dog with me in the Cabin to Madrid from London. Iberia express seemed to be the only airline that would permit pets on this particular route, Whilst normal Iberia airline does not.
 After spending many hours trying to get hold of customer service and being kept on hold whilst they find out the answer to every simple question, they finally approved my dog to travel in the cabin with me.

HOWEVER, something told me to do a little more research and triple check every would go to plan, which is when I realised that the flight I was booked on was to be operated by Iberia and NOT Iberia express. Meaning, I would have turned up at the check in desk on the day of flight and have been refused to board with my dog - Despite the fact that I booked with Iberia express AND had a member of staff approve my dog on the flight?!
So, I call up again, explain the situation. Yes, my theory is correct, I would indeed be refused to board with my dog as the flight is being operated by Iberia. No, Iberia express doesn’t even fly this route. No, they will not refund me a single penny for their own incompetence.

So, £150 in the toilet. And an extra £300 I won’t get back for all my dogs travel documents, which I will have to pay for again as I have now missed my 10 day window to leave the country. (Another ridiculous policy thanks to brexit)"

We landed in a terminal that was a 20 minute bus ride from the departing terminal and had to go through passport control, which only had two employees working it.

Over 40 people from the first flight did not make the connecting flight and the gate was completely empty when I got there, just one minute after scheduled departure time.

For 9 hours you had to stay sat down without any of them actually at least going through and asking if anyone needs anything.

8.24194145202637,3.75484395027161,"Unprofessional Airline Staff",1,"I would like to write you this letter of complaint following a very serious chain of events that occurred on flight number 6586 that took off from Bogota on 18.10 at 21:15. As part of it, I received disgraceful treatment from some of the air crew on the plane, an attitude I have never received in all the last 20 years I have flown (including many flights with Iberia).

During boarding the plane I noticed that a mother with her two children were sitting in me and my boyfriend’s seats. I drew the attention of the flight attendant, Mrs. M.A. Martinez, who in turn began a conversation with the mother in order for her to vacate the place. I was about to start to tell Mrs. Martinez that I don’t mind to give up my seats in order for the mother to seat with her children but  Mrs. Martinez did not bring me to complete the sentence and raised her voice to me (in Spanish) that I would wait patiently. When I told her I did not speak Spanish and asked her to speak English, she shouted rudely, """"This is Colombia and we speak Spanish."""" Throughout the conversation, Mrs. Martinez refused to speak to me in English and explain the situation to me, on the contrary, she kept screaming at me in Spanish sentences that I did not understand and thus humiliated me in front of all the passengers.

Unfortunately, a serious incident in itself did not end and even escalated. A few minutes later I approached Mrs. Martinez and asked her for her name so I could file an orderly complaint about her disgraceful behavior. She refused to tell me her name. Worse, she also tried to hide the tag with her name. After standing for a minute I was able to see her tag name and wrote it down on my phone. I indicated to her that I intended to file a complaint against her and that she had acted very rudely.

To my amazement, after a few minutes the flight attendant manager arrived and in a bullying tone without hearing my side threatened to take me out of the flight. My only sin was the fact that I wanted to find out the flight attendant's name in order to file a complaint. And if all that was not enough he hurled a complete lie at me in front of all the passengers that while I was reading Mrs Martinez's name from her tag I touched her tag name. Which constitutes libel and utter falsehood. This is even doubly serious when done in front of all the passengers and harms my good name. During the flight I spoke to the passengers who were next to me while I was asking Mrs Martinez for her name and everyone unequivocally confirmed that Mrs Martinez was lying and I did not touch her tag, I just looked at her tag to know her name. I manage in Israel in a large high-tech company a team that includes 50% women. Everyone will testify that I have a lot of respect for women and I will never behave in such a despicable way that involves touching the tag name of a service provider. Plus, as I mentioned I have been flying for 20 years and have never had an exceptional case with the air crews. I intend to conduct a polygraph examination in Israel regarding Mrs. Martinez's false claim and to sue her and the stewards manager for libel.

I also intend to contact the various media in my country and the relevant authorities in order to report this serious case which included damage to my good name and a chain of unprofessional events by Mrs Martinez and management. In addition I will file a complaint about the incident to the relevant airline authorities."

On October 1, 2021 My “WORST” airline travel experience began. We sat on a flight leaving JFK to Madrid for 5 hours only to only to be told the flight was cancelled. The employee’s could not tell us anything definitive other than good luck and I’m sorry. So I learned that those two phrases are their answers to everything. 
I called their customer service and I asked to be compensated for the hotel reservations I was going to miss and to be rescheduled and wouldn’t you know it what I got was I’m sorry and good luck.   After many attempts to contact their customer service representative (I us that term very loosely) I was told 1. They are not able to access the necessary systems on their computer to assist me; so why I am calling you and why are you called customer service?
We slept on the floor at JFK until I was able to reschedule out flight. 
Upon our return we flew from Barcelona to Madrid to only find out that the Madrid Iberia staff failed to inform us about an antigen test and we should have been tested prior to leaving Barcelona. While in Madrid I tried to ask for guidance from the Iberia employee’s and all I got was I’m sorry and good luck. 
Iberia employee’s make you feel like we must earn the privilege to request their assistance. It got so heated that the staff refused to assist me until I apologized to them.  I dug in my heels; it would be a cold day in hell before I would apologize.  
 We missed our flight that day also; but this time we were offered a hotel for the night with meals.
I have been flying for many years and never experienced some much confusion and lack of caring by the employees of Iberia. Their ability to communicate among themselves between departments to the best customer service experience is a – 100 horrible.

My expectations were already set low by the mere fact that agents at the call centre would literally hang up on me, which was frustrating to say the least. 

The experience on the plane itself was nothing to write home about. Most important to me, all the announcements were made in Spanish; I did not necessarily expect the language of the country they departed from (French and/or Dutch, given it’s Brussels) but they could at least try a few words in English. I did not heard a single word in English from the stewards, and there was 1 sentence in English from the pilot (a summary of what he said in Spanish). Service was equally austere; in fact, the interaction of the air-stewards with me was silent (which in a sense it’s a skill, but it can be perceived as rude), with an exception of a “good day” in Spanish. I don’t want to be harsh, but Iberia personnel’s behaviour makes even the customer service of Parisians feel tolerable. 

On another front, the procedures felt extremely relaxed, in the sense that a lady simply left her seat to visit the toilet while the safety video was on, and the personnel didn't even flinch; they did not bother either when passengers removed their masks during the flight (not for the purposes to eat, they had simply removed their masks).

Moreover, there was “water service” (still water or orange juice) and then the air-stewards were nowhere to be seen.

On a final critique, we purchased economy comfort, which included a seat with XL legroom; unfortunately, there was a last-minute change of plane (which changed our seat-selection even though we had checked-in, which I accidentally found out myself since there was no notification of any kind), and there were no XL seats on the seat arrangement of the new plane, which made the purpose of paying for a seat rather pointless.

Overall, maybe OK for a direct flight (definitely not for a long-distance one though), but I would prefer an alternative if possible."

The overstressed gate agent in Costa Rica wouldn't let us board and Iberia refused to honor the refund, blaming Covid and the country of Spain in the process (when it was their own errors/decisions, made by the low level, understaffed and overworked gate agents of Iberia).

I don't even really know the point of writing this review because they clearly don't care. I guess if you read this and have any other option besides flying Iberia, you should do so.

Here's just the main bullet points:

1. Customer service number never picks up phone if you're requesting in English language. I've had to call continuously for days to finally have someone pick up - just for the call to disconnect...

2. Flights routinely get delayed, cancelled, and because you can't reach them by phone, you can't even rebook easily. My flight was cancelled 5 minutes before departure and they told us to drive 2 hours to another airport... lol WHAT?

3. Checked baggage literally gets lost 75% of the time for me. It was just lost on my way back from Spain and also once I recovered it five days later, someone had cut off my lock and stole over $250 of goods from my bag, leaving it in a total mess inside. The last few times I flew with them and my partner, they also lost her bags!

4. The business class offering is a joke. I got food poisoning from the steak. I took one bite and knew it had gone bad. No offerings of a wine menu, dinner menu, NADA!

5. The irony is afterwards I got a customer satisfaction survey and it was in German. How do you even mess up the last step? When have I ever indicated my preferred language is German? 

6. The website doesn't work most of the time, in fact it forces you to be a Male if you're a Female often times and doesn't let you change it. It's just so incredibly buggy.

My recommendation to flyers: Avoid Iberia at all costs. I fly more than 99% more than people and Iberia is literally leaps and bounds worse than even Aeroflot.

We flew with Iberia in August (Mexico-Madrid-Dublin). We encountered a number of problems with Iberia; prior to boarding; regarding correspondence issued to us by Iberia prior to and during our trip, as well as a cancelled flight on the last leg of our journey. We were stranded for over 24 hours in Madrid because Iberia cancelled our flight and only offered us an alternative the next day. We had a number of out-of-pocket expenses as well as having to take extra time off work. But Iberia did not care. And that was very clear.
Firstly it was very difficult to get in touch in Iberia. Every time we tried to contact them by phone we were cut off. We were unable to access anyone via the web using the online forms, as they were restricting us from entering information. We tried to go to one of the Iberia counters at one of the airports and they were all closed. We sent numerous private messages through Messenger on Facebook that were unanswered. Only when we tagged Iberia on a public post on Facebook did they start to answer a message. Even then we were given the run around. Firstly we were fobbed off to BA, who subsequently wrote back and said it was Iberia's responsibility to deal with a particular issue. Iberia also advised we could contact ServIberia. When we accessed it, it said ' sorry this page has flown'. 
Eventually someone in Iberia gave us a correct link we could use to contact ServIberia. The response through ServIberia to our complaint was very disappointing to say the least. It seemed to be just some template letter with a few standard phases and an opt out clause that allowed Iberia not to help us. We were once again left feeling that Iberia did not care.
We can see from Iberia's Facebook page we were not the only customer struggling to get in touch with Iberia.
It's a pity Iberia can't take note of the customer feedback  and overhaul their customer service strategy which in our view, is clearly ineffective.
The reality is that an unhappy customer tells a lot more people about their experience. Poor customer service affects the bottom line!

We were not able to check in online for the second leg of our flight, nor was the ticket agent for Iberia able to check us in at the Kefalonia airport.

We had a 2 hour window to do all this, in a packed airport, where no one spoke English.  Our 2 hour window was shorted to 1.5 hours because we sat at the gate in Madrid for a half hour because they did not have a staircase to allow us to disembark and get on the bus.  Best part - no air conditioning when we finally got on the plane.

Additionally, the Iberia customer service on the plane is non-existent.  We were given a small paper cup for water, which they filled with about 2 ounces of water.  Forget the exasperation from the stewardess when you asked for more water.  They ran out of the pasta, and the only other option was rice and a rubbery beef patty on top, stale bread, and a small piece of cake.  They did not have a salad, nor fruit.  Normally, I wouldn't care because we always purchase water bottles and food before we board a plane.  But, given the check-in problems, we were literally running to make the plane and did not have any time to purchase food.

After hours on the phone with no luck, I finally connect with someone at 1am only to tell me that I can only add suitcases during the time of check-in and they won't tell you how much each suitcase costs before hand. This is a blatant violation of their client's right to information on the actual cost of their travels. Carrying a suitcase is a part of traveling and should not be treated as an exceptional thing. Not surprisingly, the price is highly inflated, and its much cheaper to ship a box than pay for a suitcase let alone a 75 euro extra charge if you're above 23 kilos.They try to make an unnecessary amount of money through this method driven by a lack of information up front."

It’s very difficult to direct yourself and the staff at this airport are not very helpful and rude. The people here just look at you and talk to you like   you’re the S word. Iberia airline did not inform us that we would need a negative covid test before boarding our flight, so my bf and i were not allowed  on the plane (yes we’re vaccinated) and this came as a total shock to us. Keep in mind we had been running around the airport for an hour trying to  make it on time just to get rejected at the gate. To add to that, our suitcases were already on the plane so although we were stuck in Madrid, our stuff  left for NY. Afterwards, we were at the airport for five hours trying to figure everything out. We were fortunate enough to get tested on time at the  airport although the staff was also quite rude. It took about 2 hours to finally be seen by someone. While in line we learned that about a dozen other  people were in the same situation as us. I think that alone just says a lot about the quality of Iberia.  After getting tested with a negative result we were
 told to head to the ticket booth line to receive new boarding passes for the following day. The lady who helped us at the ticket booth desk had a horrible attitude (surprise, surprise.) Before i even got to explain to her our situation she made a snappy remark at me. After 15 mins she was able to get us new boarding passes and a voucher for a hotel nearby, which was the least they could do for their s****y customer service. The following day we got to the airport an hour before the departure time. We 
attempted checking in using the kiosk but it wouldn’t work so we decided to get in line to check in with a representative instead. While in line my bf asked one of the staff a question and she proceeded to tell us that we could not board our flight ... we were confused and irritated at this point. According to the lady we were too late (We were an HOUR early) like how is that possible ? She made us step out of the line and told us that we would need to get new boarding passes for the next day .. like is this a joke? I was so pissed i was ready to hit someone preferably one of the staff. About 40-50 mins later we were helped by someone. We explained to her what had happened and when we asked her why we weren’t allowed to board our flight she responded with “idk you should’ve been able to” ... so as you can see the customer service here is awful, the staff are rude and clueless, there is a lot of miscommunication from the airline, and no one wants to spend more than a minute to help. So as a result my bf and i had to stay in Madrid for not one but two nights, wearing the same clothes, and extremely exhausted after all the bs we had to deal with from Iberia.

and now about their service: there is none, everything I found out is from the internet. The phones given in Spain were useless, a pity for the money thrown away.

Nothing was edible. 1/2 glass of water and coffee was immediately distributed, then no one received anything. The flight lasts 5.5 hours ...interesting why the whole team gets paid, they didn't do anything!
On return flight, Iberia checks in for all existing flights at that time only at 3 counters. One of them was always busy with families with children, so there were 2 left.
Many people did not respect the turn, screaming and even beating, but apart from one person who took care to sit with a mask on his face, no one was interested in anything.

They worked on it for about 10 mins // telling me the whole time that my status didn't matter for booking seats.  Finally, they told me that a supervisor had authorized the booking of the seats.  I got seats for our family and asked for a confirmation.  The confirmation came through from their booking system -- Amadeus.   On the day of my flight, I proceeded to the Airport and was told I didn't have any seat assignments.  I showed them the confirmation and was told that's not from Iberia with a shrug of the shoulder.

Iberia flouts the law by never giving customers mandatory compensation as per EU regulations. This has been highlighted to the European Council with no result.

They also routinely do not store check-in luggage in the hold due to lack of space. Like most airlines, they charge for check-in luggage, meaning that most passengers bring the maximum size carry on, which does not fit in the overheads on smaller planes, therefore carry-on is put in the hold with priority and check-in is left on the tarmac. This would be somewhat if they followed the law afterwards and compensated passengers according to the law for their business decision, but they don't.

I have also been in situations where Iberia was unable to bring me to my final destination, again with no compensation.

It seems to me like they are protected by the Spanish courts as any escalation of this illegal behaviour is unsuccessful. Using an airlines claims service such as Airhelp will likely also not get you a result as they will fight any claim tooth and nail.

Basically, if you want to arrive at your destination with your luggage or be correctly compensated when you don't, don't fly Iberia. their low cost partner Vueling seem to be more compliant than the full-cost national airline."

On November the 20th 2020 I requested a voucher for my flights to Spain, for me and my 4 years old.
The flight was on Christmas time and I received changes on flight times.
At the beggining my sister was coming with us under the same booking, but we splited the booking off on November the 14th, as she was unsure if she wanted the voucher.
At the end she decided to request the voucher and she received it.
Mine, however was denied. I called Iberia to request it again as I was entitled to it, the same way my sister was. They told me I was right and they processed it again. A month later, I contacted them again as I never received the voucher or any kind of notification from Iberia. A lady told me, the voucher under my name was approved, but my son's was failing. She said it was caught on a sort of loop of requested-processed-denied and the matter had already escalated to another department. She told me I could not get the voucher for my flight as both were under the same booking and I had to wait for my son's one to be approved. I was worried the dates of the flight were going to arrive and I did not get the voucher. The lady reassured me the voucher process had already started and it did not matter if the flight date arrived.
On Jannuary I tried to call them again quoting the incident number 20210202-12217012. The man I spoke to said he was looking at the voucher on his screen but the number was missing. He told me he was going to pass the issue to the voucher department and I will get it within 2 weeks. Since then, I have been calling every fortnight and they say they will contact me back within 2 weeks.
I still have no vouchers and no money. When I ask for the refund the say they will contact me in 2 weeks. When I ask for someone to contact me about it they say '2 weeks'. And every 2 weeks I have to call Iberia back to get the same answer.
And by the way, 2 days before the first flight, I received an email from Iberia saying that my 4 YEAR OLD SON had an upcoming flight. My name disappeared from the booking.

Other airlines are Aeromexico and Latam. Both accepted to extend booking until Dec 2021 for flights in 2022. Iberia still refuses.
Why do I say they are dishonest:

1- When COVID restrictions started, they lured their clients into vouchers with a 10 or 15% additional amount. Doing so, they did voluntarily omit to tell their clients that they could be reimbursed as per European regulation. They just did not propose it and counted on the rebate offered to distract they clients.

2- There is no way to send an email to customer service, let alone escalating an email to a manager. The only way to get to customer service is to call. However, doing so, the agents on the line tell you that their role is not to manage vouchers. For this, they send you to the website of Iberia, which has a form for complaints that does not accept vouchers number, but only the original booking number... which is not accepted in my case since the voucher number replaced the original booking number. So basically, you cannot use either their complaint form.

There was no social-distancing at all, as a immune-compromised, I was really scared. (I had to fly, i came to work in the Caribbean) The crew was rude and not helpful at all. They acted like they did us a favor. They only spoke Spanish, if you wanted to talk in English you were stupid and they did not care about your needs.  We did not get enough water, only 2 times during a 9 hours flight! The food was awful as well. Also, the cleanliness was terrible, we could say non-existent!

We arrive at the airport, at check-in they see the booking of the seats but could not find the purchase of luggages while the total of EUR we paid on Revolut and showed to the guy was exactly matching the online cost of seats and luggages! Refusing any discussion he sent us to the ticket office. Going there they tell us they cannot find it, that we must pay and put a complaint online. In short that is the same useless help as the first guy. Resigned, We go back to the counter to pay with another person. That one charges us the luggage and without telling us anything she also recharged us for the seats that we already had! We ended up paying 40€ per luggage and another €10 for each seat, so a total of €100. After explaining some more the injustice of making pay

I was handed a moist toilette and trash bag (yes this is business class) just prior to takeoff. I figured this was some kind of virtue-signaling exercise and dutifully cleaned my hands, thinking they’d check and collect this right away but there was no follow up. I finally figured out this would be the main way to dispose of trash on this flight! (yes in business class). 

Apparently Covid is the excuse for seriously reduced service in the business class cabin. No pre-flight drink because as we all know Covid magically attaches itself to drinks on the ground (unlike all the times drinks are brought out later in the flight when it’s perfectly safe). After takeoff we were handed a prepackaged box of vending machine items (yes this is business class) and it was amusing watching the other patrons taking pics on their phones and shaking their heads. I showed a pic to a friend later and he described it as “prison food.”

Seating in this cabin was comfortable so they got that right.

Later in the flight I caught a flight attendant lounging in the galley with his mask unattached while the residue from everyone’s drink and food items was piling up in the business class cabin. Covid is the excuse for all kinds of misbehavior and lack of service. I hope all airlines aren’t like this.

Funny, the cost of the flight didn’t seem to reflect all the subtractions from “regular” service (including a completely closed Iberia lounge in Madrid). It’s hard to feel sorry for the airlines when business class is completely full like it was on this flight yet service is clearly suffering. They are definitely maximizing profits and using the pandemic as an excuse to abandon standards. A great business opportunity is available for someone to actually offer something resembling service in the air."

Madrid - Heathrow - despite being at the gate 15 mins before, the connecting flight had taken off without a load of passengers booked on the plane.
After incredibly bad organisation at customer service desks and rude staff,  I was booked on the flight the next morning, which was the day the UK introduced PCR tests which I did not have*. I was not allowed to leave the terminal to get a test because of customs. Iberia said they would let me on the plane the next day despite no test (and the British embassy also confirmed this was ok given the situation) - it was all organised as an exception. After sleeping in the freezing cold terminal, the next day they refused me on the plane. They had to re-book me on the flight later that day, where I feared the same thing would happen again. Iberia were useless, and not concerned about giving me any solutions throughout the situation. They had hours to work with customs and the embassy to get this resolved, and they were just horrific. Promises from one side of the airport (by Iberia supervisors), failed to reach other help desks they told me to go and see, who they said would be aware of the situation (they weren't and they were useless and accusational). My luggage had already flown to London without me I found out later - they took hours to tell me where my bags were. Their duty of care to customers was appalling. I understand these are testing times and issues will occur, but how they dealt with it just made the whole thing much more distressing. I felt like I was Tom Hanks stuck in the terminal forever. 
Overall I arrived in Heathrow 25 hours after I was meant to. The final plane I took off on was 1 hour late because we actually waited for people on a connecting flight! I was made to queue for help many more times than needed, and generally exposed to the virus far more than I should have been. How these guys are still in business I have no idea.

We had a return flight (two separate bookings for me and my partner) to the US. In short:

1) BOOKING: I selected a package with cancellation insurance as I considered it to be a crucial factor for going with Iberia. The order went through, but in the end, I just received a message regarding the failure of contracting the insurance. I was NOT given an option to reconsider my purchase, they deducted the rest of the booking just fine i.e. flights, extra cost for seats etc. The fact that the confirmation email couldn't be sent was the least of the problems (I have proof).

2) POST-BOOKING 1: My booking never actually showed up in my account even after numerous tries of adding it. I could only review it if I searched for it separately.

3) POST BOOKING 3: There were times when my bookings got mixed up and random booking codes were shown on the site (I have proof).

4) POST-BOOKING 2: Iberia detached two suitcases from my booking, which I had to chase to get a separate booking number for them.

Then, obviously my replacement flight which I bought from the voucher got cancelled too, at which point I asked for a monetary refund as I could not plan like that: surprisingly their official (and only) communication changed to this: """" It's not possible to give a cash refund for bookings paid with vouchers"""". I only purchased with a voucher as my original flight – which was paid by card – was already canceled and I trusted the airline a second time by accepting a voucher. So no monetary refund.

6) FALSE INFORMATION ON REFUND REQUEST AND CUSTOMER DISCRIMINATION: I have had tens of phone calls with them always stating I will not accept a voucher under any circumstances for the second cancellation, and I request a monetary refund. These were regarding two separate bookings (2 x 208.95 EUR), which apparently is more than what they value a customer for since I and my partner will never choose this company again and trying to spread the word to everyone we meet. So just to state it, I was asking for less than 500 EUR refund after the issues and incorrect (highly likely illegal) handling of my bookings, 2 cancellations, and numerous phone calls that cost me money. I said I would drop my case if I get what I am owed. On most of these, I got their usual reply stating that booking made with a voucher cannot be refunded to a bank account – again, never was I offered the option for a refund in the first place –, however on two separate occasions when I called in Spanish I was ensured that the refund will be made to my bank account (I always stated not to proceed otherwise). Needless to say, this was discrimination at its best too, as the English-speaking customer service clearly had other instructions on treating customers, while the Spanish one was more helpful. In the end, this did not happen, and I got refunded with a voucher, on top of this Iberia claimed such information was never provided and falsely accused me of incorrectly stating what actually happened.

7) REFUND TO VOUCHER WHEN EXPLICITLY REFUSED: As I have described, I stated I do not accept a voucher and want a monetary refund. I was assured on two separate phone calls it would happen for the two separate bookings (only when calling in Spanish...), but I finally relieved that almost a year of requests and chasing Iberia paid off, and I will get my 420€ back. Iberia thought otherwise and while I was refusing to accept a voucher, they simply made the refund to one anyway while I was on the phone with them!

To warn people how desperate they might get if they decide to fly with Iberia, I am outlining my next steps to get support on proving how Iberia mistreated me and very likely many other customers:
1. Review & flight cancellation rights ( done)
2. Turn to AEPD – the Spanish Data Protection Agency
3. File a claim through a 3rd party
4. Contact consumer protection authorities

So overall, please think twice / three times or more before ever deciding to purchase a ticket with Iberia. They treat their customers horribly in a time when they need to support the most, and that says everything about a company. Iberia, is a customer really worth less than 200 EUR?"

I had never flown with them before and after reading the reviews I was a little nervous, however I went ahead and booked a flight home anyway. Shortly after booking the flight I received news that my local area at home was seeing a surge in cases, and that both my parents (both NHS front line workers) were working 13+ hour days and it was unsafe for me to go home. The only option Iberia offered me when cancelling my flight was a voucher, with the conditions that I book again on a direct, Iberia operated only flight. Despite trying to find the option for a full refund, I was unable to do so, and instead had to book a flight to Bulgaria, where I am a medical student. 
I tried to use the voucher code Iberia had given me, however low and behold, the voucher couldn't be used on this flight. I will never be contemplating flying with Iberia again, and neither will my family, let alone physically getting on their airplanes or using the voucher code. I had to rebook a flight with Bulgaria Air, which cost me £200. All in all I have lost out on £300 due to Iberia's poor booking policies and refund policies. 
As much as I understand we are in the middle of a pandemic, I think this form of refund offer is quite frankly horrific. I earlier rang the customer service line and was told to simply sell my Iberia voucher on to someone else. 
If I could give this a -5* rating I would, I haven't been offered any form of compensation that is actually useful to me, and my money is clearly still in Iberia's pocket and looks likely to remain that way unless I kick up enough of a fuss.

First the website section wasn't working to enter the day for DOB and only accepted 01. So after booking had to call them to get that changed. 

After booking and talking to an agent they indicated the original route couldn't work and would need to be changed. The original fare was 697 EUR and the new fare was to be 528 EUR. Despite the new fare being LESS than the old, they charged 58 EUR fare difference plus change fee, plus booking fee for a total of over 240 EUR !! 

The agent on the phone took 58 min on the phone trying to run my credit card 4 times and never got it done despite giving all the correct information. 
I called back an hour later and spoke to another agent who saw the info in the sytem and when she read it back to me, the last agent had my country as New Zealand!! I'm in the Caribbean! This agent fixed the other agent's incompetence and the payment was done. 

Finally... the Optima package was paid for which includes 1 checked bag and free seat reservation 24hrs before. Again with issues to their website when trying to reserve the seat the page had an error. So again a call was made to them and was told they can only make a seat reservation for a fee.

We took a family vacation last summer in 2019 and visited Portugal through Iberia Airline for the very first time. On our way back my checked in luggage whose one side zipper was giving problems got lost and never arrived. It was a very painful experience as it lasted for 26 days of me calling Iberia every single day and patienltylistening to the same verbiage again and again. From delayed status it changed to  lost which meant I had to document each and every item packed in my bag along with its approximate value and if possible receipts as a proof. The staff at Iberia were convinced the bag got picked up by another passenger by mistake or got stolen and there was little hope of its return. So I filed my claim with a very heavy heart as I didn't want to get compensated I just wanted my things back. Things that held emotional value for me as they were attached to memories I didn't want to loose.
Long story short on the 26th day during my routine call the representative started describing the contents inside my bag which matched my description and suddenly my bag was found! IT was in the Porto airpot for all these 26 days never got loaded in the plane and the staff just missed it!!! Yes, very frustrating but Im not complaining. It was sent back on the American airlines flight the next day and to my surprise my broken zipper help up and all my items were there. To make this ending more sweet Iberia mailed me a compensation check for $1,100 US dollars for the inconvenience I went through.
So my comments about Iberia is an average flight experience with a competent and fair customer service department.

I had to involve my credit card company where they had to fight Iberia on the charge.

Eventually my flight was cancelled due to Coronavirus. When I called to request a refund, they told me no and that I had already requested a voucher (which I did not). They couldn’t even give me my voucher number and basically told me I was Out of luck. This was their excuse for not providing a refund. Once again the agent on the phone was overly rude and did not solve my issue. I will never even think about flying Iberia again and you shouldn’t either.

This airline support assure they would help us return home in any way they could. With this in mind we chose Iberia to fly back home.

We arrived to the airport with plenty of time and were informed we were't allowed to enter because our flight had been canceled. We tried to speak with Iberia staff at the airport but there was no one to speak. Therefore our families began to call Iberia Support (wich is a VERY EXPENSIVE call to make) and when finally someone answer they did not have an answer, couldn't help and refused to pass the call to their superiors. Our families called both Iberia and Iberia PLUS (the so called members & miles program) on and on till SOMEONE FROM Iberia STAFF told us BOTH our flights had been canceled and there would be someone on the ground to help.

First, to stop dehydration, water or soft drinks should be regularly served on a long haul flight - none were served. Second, I was told on the Madrid to Santiago leg that I would be charged 5 Euros for a spirit drink - I know to expect to pay on short haul, but was surprised at the charge on long haul - the first time I’ve encountered this. The paper towels in the toilets ran out half way through the Santiago leg and were not replenished. The selection of films and entertainment was very good, but, whilst not expecting a gourmet experience, the food was the poorest I’ve experienced on any airline. My first flight with Iberia in recent years and clearly an airline to be avoided."
9.90257740020752,3.79025030136108,"Iberia Refund Policy",1,"I booked my flights with capital one travel (a third party agency). My flight was due to depart to Madrid on  February 28 and return march 7 from Barcelona back to Miami. Since Tuesday February 25, I began to make contact with the airline since there had been new cases arising  of COVID19 in Spain. Fearing for my health, I decided to get in contact with the airlines to cancel my flight and get a refund.. due to the fact that this was an epidemic (at the time--which later became a pandemic). For the past few days before my flight I was bounced back and forth from Iberia to capital one travel. Neither of the companies wanting to provide any service of understanding. Iberia stated that since I booked through a third party agency, that THEY (capital one travel) had to give me my money back. When I spoke to capital one travel, they told me Iberia needed to provide a waiver for me to be able to receive """"credit"""" for my flight (No refund). If I did not obtain a waiver I would have to pay a penalty of 275$ per person (this was a trip for two), in order to rebook and use the availably credit. I began to call Iberia more often, I was told to wait for the next day and the next day to see if the company came out with waivers since the conditions were changing by day. However, the morning of my flight (my flight departed at 7 pm), I was on the phone with capital one travel and Iberia nonstop. Neither representative were of any assistance. One thing that really disappointed me was the fact that when I asked the Iberia representatives to transfer me to a supervisor, they told me no and that my case didn't require a supervisor. I asked who else can I speak with that can get the supervisor on the line, the representative told me """"hang up and call again.""""  I asked for the gentlemen's name (I still have it written down), and hung up and called again. The next representative that answered said the same thing and when he heard the frustration in my voice he then started to tell me that there was no supervisor there at the moment, I told him I could not understand how such a big company doesn't not have a supervisor there. Miraculously the supervisor, named Gabriella answered the phone. She did NOT let me speak to get my point across, she kept repeating the same thing, and was very dismissive, once again while trying to get my point across, the SUPERVISOR hangs up on me. 

Around the early afternoon I decided to show up to the airport to speak with the supervisor at the front desk of Iberia airlines. The situation was explained, she was very pleasant and told me she wrote a note there that states that I was there and the situation had been explained and that I would NOT be considered a no show. This was done """"supposedly"""" to see if the airline over the phone or the travel agency could do something about my situation. I asked her to print a copy of the note she wrote but she stated that there were several notes there from my calls and that it would be too long to print. At the end, when I got home I reached out to both Iberia and capital one travel via phone and they both stated no note had been written. According to the representatives from capital one and Iberia the supervisor at the front desk--Natiuska, had not written any note. I came to realize this is possibly why she did not want to print the note for me to keep as proof. 

At 5 pm, I had no other choice but to cancel my flight and have to pay a penalty of $275 per person for when I have to rebook by Dec of this year. As explained several times to both capital one travel and Iberia, (even before COVID19 reached its peak), how do I have the certainty that this epidemic/pandemic will be resolved by then, and what if I cannot travel during these times. The world has changed tremendously in the last month. If I would've traveled to Spain I would've either been infected with COVID19 not knowing how it'll affect my health, been quarantined for months (stuck in Spain) due to others around me infected, or even brought the disease back to my home after my trip where I put my family at risk, my coworkers, and my patients (I am a nurse) at risk. 

I saw beforehand something that companies failed to open their eyes to. I had a fear for my life and for those of my family and these companies truly lacked the morality and understanding to recognize this. I am currently still having to pay for the original cost of the flights and then have a payment to make if I rebook, if I do not I lose the money I invested. Which more than likely I will not be able to rebook for a trip this year. 

I am asking, to get my money in return. This is not a time for travel. Many people are out of their jobs, several businesses are closing. Many people are going through several different hardships. This should not be one of them."

Leaving Lima during the check in they charged us 110 dollars for the additional luggage. They told us we can pay it or leave the luggage behind. So we were pretty much blackmailed into paying the fee which we did not count with, because the official site said a different thing. When I tried to complain at the airport they said they cannot do a thing and I have to file a complaint online. When I tried to file a complaint online after the arrival, first I couldn't file a formular, they didn't respond to me on Facebook and they couldn't understand me over the phone. After a while later I managed to file a formular online, to which they responded, that they can't accept the complaint because when you pay online, they price in the facturation may differ. What? The calculator told me online that the price will be 60 dollars and later they charged 110 dollars on the spot. That's fraud.

Iberia doesn't really care about the law (I wonder if they adhere to safety regulations?) and preferred to deceive me into requesting a voucher by putting a link in the email that led directly to a page declaring that a voucher would be issued - no intermediate page explaining options, no final confirmation request, nothing. Unlike some other airlines that at least seem to want to retain clients, the Iberia voucher did not even include a bonus, i.e. was issued for the amount of the canceled flight, right down to the penny.

Overall, the in-flight service was what ticked me off. First of all, when a passenger clicks the """"assistance"""" button, don't you think there's a reason why they asked for a flight attendant?? These flight attendants not only did NOT come (until I flagged them down when they were walking by.. after 30+ minutes of waiting), but also - when passengers give up/ fall asleep - they have the audacity to just walk down the aisle and turn all the assistance lights off.

In my particular case, I needed water (to take time- sensitive medicine). I asked for an attendant, waited for about 45 minutes. Noone came to answer. Meanwhile, I hear plenty of talking and giggling and see them congregated at the back of the plane. Did you come here to work/ serve or chit-chat??? Then, when I finally got a hold of one lady (goodness gracious I wish I caught her name so I could expose her), she said - """"no water available"""". What? Are you freakin kidding me.
So I flagged another lady down (about 10 minutes later), and asked her for water. She ROLLED. HER. EYES. at me. And said, """"yes we will bring you shortly"""". Well, shortly never came. And I was so annoyed that I got up and walked to the back of the plane and asked for water.

They not only gave me half a cup... but literally shoved the cup at me and shouted, """"seat belt sign is on! go sit down please."""" I said back, """"I asked for you to come to my seat and waited for almost two hours. Why is it so difficult to bring me water?""""
And there was no apology... just a shoo shoo, motioning for me to sit down.

There's more I could say but hopefully this is enough for you to realize that their service is CRAP and I wouldn't board with their airline even if that flight was $100.

Iberia didn't give any explanation. Iberia just switched me to the next available flight without asking whether the solution was viable to me. The options Iberia gave in their email were either calling a 901 number, that has a cost for the caller because it is not covered by the flat fee of Spain's residential phone operators, or reach them through a link provided in Iberia's email. The latter option didn't work as it returned an error message that I copied and have stored to present a formal complaint against Iberia. Also, this month's invoice from my phone service provider is going to prove that I spent 4 hours trying to reach Iberia on the phone, sometimes waiting up to 20 minutes or more till I would eventually hang up and try again. When I finally reached Iberia on the phone at around 24.00 hours, I requested the reimbursement of my flight ticket as I wasn't interested in using it two hours after my original flight was leaving. After the hour of the original plane had passed, I received an email of the kind that doesn't admit reply, telling me that they acknowledged my communication, that they had canceled the fight for a strike, and that they were sorry their option was """"tiring"""" for me. The whole thing is outrageous, their paternalism: no detail whatsoever concerning the """"strike."""" """"Sorry that it was tiring"""" and that they would not pay for any of my extra costs. I don't get it.
Are they going to reimburse me for my canceled flight or not? That is the only thing I requested and care about. Iberia is public (as in that it is owned by private investors), part of a British group. Still, Iberia/Vueling has an actual monopoly on many of the best slots at most of Spain's airports, that they received when they were a Spain's estate owned company. And as a virtual monopoly, they only pay lip service to Corporate Responsibility and Customer care. No matter they render a disastrous service. When they make tonnes of money, their private owners make a bundle; when they had a hard year, they just cry, and the government comes running and compensates them out of the citizen's taxes.

Arrived at airport in Madrid waited for over 45 minutes no luggage arrived, no one came to apologise or give information not even for those with urgent transfers, we all had to queue up and register a complaint, left 3 hours later. Got to hotel thinking it would arrive later, nothing came for TWO DAYS. it arrived just before our return. I put in a claim spent at least 3 hours more with all documentation. Got only half of what I asked for despite the fact that claim was quite low considering I had to buy everything to survive for two days including underwear, sleepwear, socks Etc. It was unbearable to stay in travelled clothes. I have challenged the figure but have not heard back yet. Will never ever fly Iberia again."
9.01608753204346,4.5861644744873,"Iberia Flight Delays",4,"Before my travel I red very bed reviews about this company and the tickets were already purchased so there was no going back. However, my expirience was not bad at all. The stuff on the airplane was very kind and helpful. The pilots were very good and all four of our flights were very comfortable and on time.

We transfered flights in Madrid and we had only an hour between flights but managed to catch our flight to Malaga on time due to the fact that we didn’t have to switch terminals because Iberia has it’s own terminal at Madrid airport (in this case we were landing and flying from T4). The problem was an hour wasn’t enough for them to move our luggage so it was left in Madrid (the same thing happened with all the other passangers who were on the same connected flight from Zagreb to Malaga). Luckily at Malaga airport there was an Iberia custommer service desk and they were also very kind, took all the information about out suitcases and our location so they delivered our luggage with the first flight next morning and brought it to the hotel we were staying at. So that could have been a very traumatic experience, but they managed to make it okey. They also have a person there who takes care of the luggage himself when this happens and that was very helpful. 

On our way back to Zagreb we had a two hour pause between flights (also in Madrid) and that was enough for them to move the luggage so our suitcases came to Zagreb  normally. 

The main point is, when flying with this company, I strongly recommend either taking a longer pause between flights or just bringing your hand luggage because it is very likely for your luggage in hold to be left behind on such a small pause as 1 hour, although they say 45 minutes is enough for them to switch luggage. The good thing was we took travel insurance on our own and we managed to get over 100 euros beucause our luggage was more than 6 hours late so that’s definitelly another thing I recommend.

In addition, when flying with a connected flight like this one, you do not have go through any security checks again between flights, just passport control. This was another info I wasn’t sure about before my flight.

BUT, When I choose this flight and pick basic ,it show me  what cover in basic, it will have a free check luggage plus meal  service in flight, only can’t choose seat and no online check in.  This is ok  for me so I pick it. 
After I booked it, they email me a booking confirmation and clearly mark we will have meal and free check bag in the LEVEL flight. Later, I received the flight ticket number together with the itinerary. It all different in this email. It is no free check bags and no meal serve in the flight !!!! 
I use my confirmation code to check my fight in Iberia.com. It still clearly mark the free luggage and meal including in my return flight.
For safety, I call the airline ( of course long hold) and like to make it clear and forward back the conformation email to them as that agent instruction. After couple days, no respond. Call them again, then just told me in their system is show we don’t have mean and free check bags and ignore what the confirmation email. Even I go back online now, it did show sane day same route at same price, also clearly mark it has free check luggage and meal in basic fare for both flight.
I feel really not happy not regarding I need to pay extra for meal and luggage which I always did if I booked the low cost flight since it clearly told you before you buy.

Clearly, if we did not wish to travel without our luggage we had no other choice than pay an additional fee for the luggage, which was as much as the flight-ticket itself. Such a business behavior is usually described as fraud. Afterwards we explained the case to Iberia online via their “complaint” site and claimed a refund of the wrongly charged extra luggage fee. They simply dismissed the claim without any explanation, and upon a second (and third) complaint asking for a factual explanation for the refusal, we just received a standard (autogenerated?) answer of refusal that the case had been settled.

The flight attendants are always pleasant, every time I have arrived earlier than expected, and they actually have very good food.

I know Iberia doesn’t look the cheapest but when you factor in the service and what you are actually getting it is one of the best choices. When you look at a flight with Norwegian (for example) it seems much cheaper, but with Norwegian you don’t get nearly as much as you do with Iberia. Iberia doesn’t have all of the hidden costs like some airlines. 
Flying the most basic, cheapest way you will be given; a blanket, a pillow, headphones, a full lunch/ dinner meal, a starter drink, coffee and/or tea after your meal, and a refill of coffee/tea, then a second smaller meal/snack with coffee/tea a few hours later. (This is for a longer flight, a one hour flight won’t give you these things) 
The larger meal consisted of salad, bread roll, tortellini stuffed with cheese or meat, and a piece of dessert cake item. 
The small meal is a crossaint sandwhich, a candy, and a yogurt, and usually some other small item. 
When you buy the tickets you can specify if you have special dietary needs. I have put a lactose free option in mine before and they are good about bringing you everything lactose free.

Flight wise, I feel that Spanish pilots tend to fly faster, but that’s an opinion not a fact haha. I have experienced turbulence on a flight but I don’t blame pilots for that sort of thing. Spanish flight attendants are more attentive than Spanish waiters— it will not be American service, or British service, because that is not the Spanish way. I do believe that the service is very good if you judge based on Spanish customs. 

I have always been satisfied with Iberia’s services and flights. 

I have flown with them multiple times and will continue to fly with them in the future. 

Last tip; buy a plane ticket three months in advance for international flights, and travel on week days as this will make the tickets cheaper.

I had bad souvenir from the airline, always late and Bajaras a old  fashion airport . I recently tray again Iberia with a range of brand new planes, with space for the legs, rather good service and wine on board. it was a good surprise as arriving on time."
9.14716243743896,5.6204047203064,"Iberia Flight Delays",1,"My niece was getting married so my mother booked round trip tickets for me from JFK to TLV with a super long stopover in Madrid in each direction, not realizing that my return ticket was on Super Bowl Sunday, and that I'd be arriving to JFK at 7:15PM, which means I'll be missing a quarter of the game at the minimum.
My 30 hour trip arrived in TLV on Tuesday night 1/28/20 at 11:30 PM and the wedding was Wednesday night so I set out to call the airline - Iberia - on Thursday to discuss a change. Sure enough they were closed and wouldn't be opening again until Sunday, the day of my flight, which would be taking flight at 6:00AM. And to make matters worse, Iberia offices aren't open anywhere, and the numbers they have listed on their website do not work, and if you call their 800 number from out of the US, it also does not work...
So I get to the airport super early on Sunday Morning 2/2/2/ and ask the Iberia desk agent to give me pricing for the change. He says he is just a desk agent and I need to wait until my layover in Madrid to speak with someone who can help me. And then the magic begins...
In Madrid, I am directed to Iberia Airlines customer service lines in Terminal S, Sections 15 or 39.. I went to both. The first agent said my ticket was non refundable, which I knew, and then said the change would cost me more than the ticket we paid for all 4 legs of my trip. I asked how that could be the case and showed the agent my booking confirmation - and the disclaimer at the bottom which clearly specifies """"change allowed at any time with a penalty of 200 Euros or $250, except in the case of not showing up for the flight (no show) which does not allow change.""""
the agent proceeded to give me a series of nonsensical responses, including the concept that my disclaimer only applied to tickets in my category, meaning that they could charge me 2000 Euros for this change alone. I asked who was telling her this info and she refused to divulge. Said I can pay the large fee or accept it. Not very accommodating! I asked how they can dismiss the disclaimer on my booking confirmation and she actually got angry with me, as if I was doing something wrong. 
I went to the next desk on the other side of the terminal to get a similar response, this time they were only trying to jack me with a nominal expense of $735 to make the change to my ticket. I asked how they can respond to my disclaimer that says I can do the change for a Max of $250. she said there was nothing to discuss. Unfortunately I cannot afford to spend that much on a change so I had to walk away..
I found a third Iberia information center, at the entrance to terminal S, to learn that we were now within an hour and a half of my flight and they could no longer sell me a ticket because I would not be flying with my luggage. All in all FORCING ME to sit in the airport for 8 hours, unnecessarily, even though I had been attempting to change my flight for 4 DAYS!!!
I get the fact that I bought a cheap ticket and have to deal with the consequences, but there's something so off-putting about Iberia's customer service and how they treat Americans. They don't have patience, talk down to us. There is barely any effort to assist, they dismiss your struggles and complain to each other that were not listening to them... 
I am now watching the early flight take off as I write these words, and am gearing up for another 5 1/2 hours of banging my head against the wall in Madrid airport, because of Iberia's incompetence and lack of interest to process another sale for their airline. 
I will honestly never fly Iberia again, and pretty confident I will never visit this stupid city again anyways. But it's not about that..
1) HOW COULD THEY LIST ON THE BOOKING CONFIRMATION THAT I CAN CHANGE MY FLIGHT FOR $250 AND THEN WHEN I TRY TO DO IT I AM TOLD THAT THIS IS NOT THE CASE? HOW CAN THEY DO THAT? 
2) HOW CAN AN AIRLINE NOT BE REACHABLE BY PHONE FOR 3 DAYS???
3) HOW CAN AN AIRLINE EXIST WITH SUCH HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE?

At some point the pilot attempted to fire up the engines to take off.  Just as they started speeding up and it felt we were starting to move... suddenly whole cabin went dark and engines died.  The pilot repeated this process another 2 times.  Each time just as the engines got loud...  Power off!  Eventually the plane limped its way to the gate (towed I assume), so the engines could get started there.  I guess it had the aeronautic equivalent of erectile dysfunction. The idea that we had to fly on a plane that couldn't even get off the ground caused a lot of concern in the cabin. Genuine fear.

The cabin crew spoke exclusively in Spanish so I couldn't follow the conversation well, but a number of passengers were very scared that the plane would crash and asked to be unloaded.  This caused an additional delay while their bags were unloaded.  I narrowly opted to stay on, having spent 30 min researching 'flying without APU' on Google.  The communication was poor, if the fault was explained better people would probably stayed on.

Overall we were 3 hours and 15 min late to arrive.  All this extra time was spent in the cabin, an anxious and fraught atmosphere with nothing except water.   I asked for something to eat and was refused. Once in the air staff then wheeled out some overpriced and horrible food (worst I've had on any airline) which we had to pay for!  They must have made a killing out of this, as everyone was starving.  

Landed in Madrid at 1.30 am.  I don't blame the staff, but I do blame the Airline for a) dodgy old plane b) undetected fault found right at time of takeoff c) failure to provide an alternative plane (this was LHR T5) d) refusal to provide adequate food and drinks during delay. Never again!

A month before flying Iberia cancels the flights and left us no option but to go on redirected flights from London to Madrid and then to New York (this added an additional 8 hours to our trip if not more because of the wait etc.). The flight itself to Madrid was horrible, their website is only in Spanish so good luck translating if you are not fluent in Spanish. It took me around 3 hours to try and check in just because I had to translate via google each sentence, also booking a seat was a nightmare, bearing in mind that seats were available to each other they booked my seat separately from my partner and another passage we were with on purpose. Every time I tried to amend this, it didn't work or they were trying to charge for this. The service overall was poor and unpleasant, completely overcrowded and sitting with strangers as their seating was unusable online. They don't really care about you when you get to the desk with any complaint, all they care about is that they took your money and you deal with what is handed to you then and there. We are still awaiting an email response from the Iberia team for compensation as we paid for direct flights and that is not what we got. Be cautious when booking with Iberia as they can just cancel or change your flights whenever it suits them regardless of what you've booked, also good luck trying to get a response from them, its been over a month and I still don't have a reply.

Whilst we accept that mistakes happen, Iberia could not manage to locate our luggage and deliver it during the 17 days that we were in Chile. This is some of the most appalling customer service that we have ever come across from any company. From speaking to people that we met in Santiago, it turns out that Iberia are notorious for losing luggage and poor customer services. Of the 5 people that we met who had flown with Iberia before (admittedly a small sample but telling), 4 said that their luggage had been lost on flights between Europe and South America or vice versa.

Iberia's customer services are extremely unhelpful and often quite rude. They send customers virtually no information without having to be chased. They ignore Emails and WhatsApp messages, sometimes for days. When contacted by telephone, all of the information that they provide is conflicting, often they are unwilling to give any information at all. On the occasions when they do oblige, they often simply read information off a computer that is days out of date and refuse to engage further when corrected on their errors. There does not appear to be any organisational mind guiding the whole process, and they do not appear to have any basic system of conveying information from one member of staff to another.

The company's logistics are also unbelievably poor. It appears that our suitcases were eventually lost during our flight change in Madrid, which Iberia fly directly to Santiago from- we would have expected them to be sent to us on the next flight the following day. However, we understand that our cases were sent to Bolivia for some inexplicable reason, despite us having no link to that country (we only know because were contacted by staff at the airport in Santa Cruz de la Sierra). The cases were located in Bolivia, but then lost again, at one stage we were told that one had gone back to Madrid and one had been lost. At another stage we were told that they had been sent to one of Colombia, Venezuela or Aruba. When we eventually gave up and demanded that they be returned to the UK, they were not delivered for five consecutive days and we eventually had to go and collect them from Heathrow Airport ourselves. When we got there Iberia told us they were not there, but then took a matter of minutes to locate them when we insisted that their member of staff go to the luggage room.

My question is that how it could be that none of the air crew checked before the plane took off. We were seated in the plane for 30 minutes before takeoff and my family was with me. A simple check would reveal we were traveling as a group so surely someone should have come to enquire with the rest of the group if one did not show up? Or would they have done a headcount check?

Where do I begin?  There seemed to be a large group of students in their early teens (possibly a large class trip) with their chaperones on this particular flight, which I think they’ve never flown before based on what I and other passengers experienced (these group of kids were from Spain).  When I boarded the plane and making my way to my seat, I couldn’t make my way up the aisle because of one of teenage kids’ luggage was in the aisle blocking passengers from moving further up.   Additionally, another female student walked across the aisle from her seat to her friend to chit chat with her while she and the luggage was blocking my way to my seat.  I had an unhappy look on my face and looked at the adults near these kids.  Thankfully, one of the chaperones told the female student to move out of the way.  Throughout the entire flight, 20 or so students were standing up in their seats talking to other students in other rows.  They all kept walking up and down the aisles.  During landing and taxing, the students would be out of their seats and open the overhead compartments.  

Unfortunately, I encountered the same group of students from MAD to FCO.  Same fiasco as was the flight from JFK to MAD (AA 8820).

We tried for many weeks to make contact with Iberia by internet and long distance phone without any result, because we had to add a lap infant.
When checking in for almost an hour,  the agent did not know much English and was very rude. She had to find out that we did not need a visa for the US. We were checking the weight of one bag which was slightly overweight, but our other bags were all underweight. So we were just going to take something out when she put a tag on it and said I have to pay 260 euros if I want the bag to go. She said nothing about being overweight and that I should have done things online and we could not do that. She also stood up and was calling another customer when the other 3 had not been checked in.
Another agent took over with the checkin and said I should have never had to pay the 260 euros, but there was nothing that she could do. I have written a complaint to AA as Iberia’s complaint does not include checkin.
Sorry for going on, but this was the worse ending to my weeks cruise around the Canary Islands. I even tried to upgrade.

For the long flights, the check in was very difficult (the app is the worst), people were rude, the food was 5/10, and the seats were not the best (6/10). 

We decided to fly business from Madrid to Grenada. For that flight, they changed the gate all the way across the airport 15 min before boarding. This involved 20 min of walking and going through security again. Annoying but not necessarily the airline's fault. We then got 5 emails telling us the gate kept changing back and forth. There were no gate agents to tell us what was happening, so we had to wait in mass at information. Eventually, they moved us to another gate 20 min after boarding was supposed to start. Then a delay was announced to us by email. An hour went by and we only found out information by the whole plane standing at the info desk to ask for answers... they just told us to wait. 
We went to the business lounge to figure out what was happening, and they told us the flight had been cancelled. They then told us they would offer us a bus later in the evening. We waited another hour and then were able to book a place on the bus at 18:30. The flight was supposed to be at 16:30ish.

What was completely unacceptable about this Iberia cancellation was that Iberia put us through FOUR gate changes at opposite ends of the massive Madrid Airport on December 21, 2019.  We started off at K72, which only showed on the departure board about 40 minutes before our scheduled departure. When we got to K72, the gate attendant said to go to M37.  We hustled to M37 and there was no one there. There were six other passengers huddled around an Iberian employee, who had no idea how to check where our flight was departing from. My phone sent me no less that 15 text messages (total) from Iberia, sending us back to K72.  At K72, the attendant said M37.  Another lengthy run back to Terminal M, which includes a ten minute airport passenger metro train ride.  At M37, there was no one there.  A passing Iberian employee shrugged their shoulders and said """"if you hurry, you can make it"""" as my phone buzzed AGAIN for K72.

Our Spanish skills are at an acceptable level and we were not behaving like a**hole tourists, we have travelled the world, but this was beyond the pale. The next morning, on the rescheduled flight to Granada, the plane they booked us all on was not big enough for accommodate all the rebooked passengers, so they bumped everyone who had a seat number above #20 from the night before.  People were livid and they had to have Security standing by. The next leg of our trip from Granada to Seville was by bus, and it was definitely a relaxing experience. Icing on the Iberian Airlines cake, when it was time to leave Spain, I couldn't complete my on-line check-in on my smart phone nor could I print my boarding passes, so I stressed until I got to the airport window in Seville and got all three boarding passes printed by an Iberian employee and into my hands.

When I had to go back to JFK to get a PIR code, their reps at JFK even suggested that’s what they are known for.  The customer service also says they should have received an itemized list of the contents BEFORE the flight.  If they’re making me check it in against my wishes then their reps @ Madrid airport should have done their job and asked for that list.   You can send all the receipts and proof that you want, you will get nowhere.  I was offered a little over $200 to make up for the close to $5k in clothing, jewelry and electronics that were stolen.  That amount doesn’t even make up for the suitcase and lock they broke.  Look at all their comments on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.  They are all filled with similar passenger complaints and no resolutions from the airline itself.  There are also comments of people saying that the airline was going to pay them a certain amount and they never received that amount."

When I finally got ahold of a customer service agent by phone (no small feet on a US cellphone in Spain on a Spanish network) they told me they had no idea where my bag was and I should hope it shows up somewhere/ some time. This caused me to cancel my first day of vacation and basically hangout at the airport scouting out my own bag. Oh the kicker when I finally got my bag the agent said “we tried to call you, you gave us the wrong number”. I responded by explaining it was a US number, she cut me off to correct me and said “No it’s not a US number you gave us the wrong number” um ok. Also according to CS there are no supervisors to speak to so don’t even ask.

Customer service at Madrid airport is the stuff nightmares are made of - you wait around for hours and I really don't envy the people who work there - they get al;l the angry passengers - Judging by the amount of people in line (at least 100), this seems to be a """"regular"""" occurrence.

I’m having a hard time even coming up with the words to express how terrible this company is. I have traveled with this airline 5 times now and my opinion of the company has only gotten worse with each trip. From the quality of their customer service to the punctuality of the flights, this airline is a complete nightmare. I have been delayed three out of five times (For 7 hours total) due to issues which were the fault of the airline, not due to weather. Another time they were simply bumping ticketed passengers to a flight an entire 24 hours later to “balance the aircraft” (and not notifying those passengers that they had been moved until they were at the airport to check bags). On one flight they seated a handicapped passenger (who was unable to stand up) in the aisle before boarding the rest of the flight and forced the passengers in the window and middle seats to step over her, putting all three individuals in a very uncomfortable position. Another time I went through the process of purchasing a ticket online only to be shown a page that said an error occurred when I clicked the button to finalize the purchase. I called the airline to get help finishing the booking over the phone and was told that, not only would I have to pay a fee to have it booked over the phone (even though it was a problem with Iberia’s website that had forced me to have to book over the phone), but that the price had augmented to 3X the price I had originally been shown in the 2 minutes between the appearance of the page saying an error had occurred and getting a representative on the phone. They would not help me to complete my purchase for the price I had already started the process of purchasing. Lastly, on the last flight I took, the seats in economy had less leg room than I had ever seen on any plane in my life. I am not very tall (less than 5’8”) and there was barely one inch between my knees and the seat in front of me. I cannot imagine how anyone much taller would have been able to sit at all.

After 40 minutes of waiting for it at the luggage conveyer belt, I realized it wasn’t there. I tried asking around and found an Iberia desk eith an agent who reassured me by telling me that the luggage had arrived and that it was located in the floor downstairs, so naturally I went to that floor and searched for around 15 minutes but it wasn't there.
So, I went back to the agent to let him know that I still did not find my luggage and he told me that he would check again by himself. After having disappeared for over 20 minutes,  he informed me that it was still in Madrid.
So i had just lost 1 hour  searching for something that wasn’t even there ( after having flied for over 6hours, with an 8 hour layover so you can imagine how tired I was) 
I started wondering: Why did he tell me before to search for it elsewhere? Did he even check and track my luggage when I first mentioned it wasn't  there?

Anyway the agent took some information in order to send me luggage on the next day (today, November the 17th) and guaranteed that it will definitely arrive  on a plane coming from Madrid to Tenerife. I got reassured as I saw a flyer mentioning an award Iberia (the airline I had just taken) received for its lost baggages management.

However, no one contacted me and I didn’t get any information on my missing luggage!
Therefore, I called Iberia’s office located at Tenerife’s Airport through several  numbers and no one ever answered (one phone number wasn’t even working). I even called Iberia’s headquarters office in England, and was given another number to call. 
I had again wasted 1 hour  between unanswered calls and automated answering machines for this same matter.
Until, I finally got my answer and to my surprise my luggage was still in Madrid even though the airport agent assured me I was going to get it by today!

I realize now how inconsistent this airport agent is, and how unprofessional and terrible Iberia’s lost and found service is.

The worst part is that Iberia is supposedly awarded for lost luggages management? All full of lies!!

The cabin crew gave a good safety demo, but that was countered by them failing to ensure window blinds were raised for take off and landing (a big safety benefit – you have a better chance of assessing an incident) and their failure to stop passengers leaping up to empty overhead bins as the aircraft neared the stand.   I do not want to be injured by falling bags….
The cabin crew standards varied. I sensed they were training some crew members, but they were friendly and helpful.  The inflight Wi-Fi was not functioning.

Iberia needs to pick up its training standards, and could learn a lot from its sister, British Airways.  The standards are very different.
I felt the cabin maintenance could have been better.  Marks and scratches on the seat backs.   Worse no toilets had any tissues – only paper towels in the tissue dispensers and the toilets could have ben cleaner.   The sink basin drains also need attention to ensure water flows away – they were clearly partly blocked.

Went to that gate - it was not staffed - only through the assistance of another passenger who was Spanish and spoke some English did we get to the correct location.

Our outbound fly was rocky because I ordered vegan meals and when the snack came, they gave me a sandwich with egg. I asked if I could be given something else instead and I was offered some fruit. 20-30 mins later it never came so I got up and asked. I was met by a very cross male cabin crew that informed that they didn’t have vegan meals but strict vegetarian and it was my DUTY to bring my own food (!). I told him that I booked my ticket through BA and I rang customer service 3 times, all in English as I live in Ireland and I was never advised of their “definition” nor that I should bring my own food. Note I travelled premium economy so you would have thought I would be treated a tiny bit better. I responded to him that as a company, it was their duty to inform passengers if they could not fulfil certain requirements and asked him to hand me the fruit. 
Our return flight was more disastrous. We queued up at the check-in desk assigned for premium economy. The line wasn’t moving as someone paying for extra luggage was there and was holding it up. I asked an assistant if one of the economy desks could take us instead to which they replied no, as they would in Iberia. Since I wasn’t having any of it, as soon as a desk freed up, I went to it. The person didn’t even bother apologising or anything and he was like you should have gone to the business queue to which I informed him I did ask and was told to go the premium economy queue. 
Once we are past security and immigration, we realise that my husband’s ticket is not his but another person’s! So much for safety and security with Iberia. We freaked out of course, went to security where they told us we should wait for the people at the gate to arrive. We do so and they reissue the now correct ticket. 
On the flight, my vegan meal contains non-vegan cheese in the salad. When the snack arrives, I am given a little container with some salad, ham and chicken!!!!!! That doesn’t even qualify as vegetarian! Maybe only paleo at best!
And then when breakfast arrives, I am given a croissant with lettuce an cheese, again!!!! And croissants are known for their huge amount of dairy butter! 
So if you want to enjoy a horror flight, do book with Iberia, because if something can go wrong, they will make sure it goes wrong."

You can buy tickets six months before your flight, and then a month before take off it turns out they never gave you the seats you paid for.  I waited until the day before the flight, then spend two or three hours downloading and printing out our boarding passes, only to find out after waiting on a one-hour line that they didn't scan on the scanner.  So we all had to go back and wait on the check in line.  If you fly another airline, you will notice that all the seats are newer and better; all the equipment is updated and works.  If you want to call Iberia customer service, you can plan on taking the day off work, because you will wait a long time to get a person.

I tried booking a flight from London to Madrid over the Christmas break. After a slow and clunky online booking process, I was sent my reservation and given 24 hrs to confirm it. However, there was a problem. The return date was wrong by an entire year.

After checking that I hadn’t made a mistake in the booking, I called them up and was told that due to a fault with their IT systems, plenty of passengers on that day had experienced the same problem. I was re-sent a flight reservation with the right date and told them to confirm it there and then over the phone. I was reassured it was all taken care of.

Several days later, I noticed that the price of my tickets had been refunded. I called customer service and told that (despite my previous confirmation over the phone) my reservation had expired and been cancelled. They made no apology for this. I was then told that I would need to rebook again from scratch but due to (another) problem with their systems, I wouldn’t be able to do that in the afternoon. I then asked to be put through to their complaints department. I was told me they didn’t have one at which point the customer service adviser hung up on me.

The outbound journey was ok, except that Iberia doesn't accept Known Traveler Numbers, so my husband and I had to go through the regular security process.  We had an offer to upgrade to business class, which we took, and that was comfortable.  The food was decent if not terrific. 

Things went sharply downhill on our return to Boston.  The flight back was operated by two Iberia affiliates (subsidiaries?): Vueling from Florence to Barcelona and Level from Barcelona to Boston.   We were not allowed to check in online for the Barcelona-Boston flight, and the counter agent in Florence said we couldn't choose our seats till we got to Barcelona, and our pre-assigned seats might not even be together.   

On arrival in Barcelona, we were told our flight to Boston would leave from Area D.  We followed the signs to Area D, but they ended abruptly at an undesignated point,  with no indication of how to continue to Area D.  After wandering around for a while we finally found an information desk, and were told we needed to go up an escalator and through passport control. We should have been given this information without having to hunt for it.  On arrival in area D we went immediately to the gate, and asked about our seats.  There were no restaurants or amenities in that area, so we couldn't even get a snack.  We asked about an upgrade, but none was available. Fortunately at least our seats were together.  Meanwhile, a long line was forming for boarding. While at the counter we were approached by a security officer and taken away for a random security check.  By the time that was over, the boarding line was about 200 people long, and we were at the end of it.  When we finally reached the checkpoint we saw that the actual gate was three flights down, and the escalator was broken.  We had a rolling carry-on and a garment bag, and the idea of dragging them down three flights of stairs was daunting. (we saw that several people were made to check their carry-ons).   A very kind official offered to take us, and one other woman, down in an elevator.  We got out at the bottom, and the kind official left us there. We found ourselves on the wrong side of a glass wall, with the boarding passengers going down the stairs on the other side.  The emergency door was locked.  After pounding on the glass for a while, a kind gentleman went back up to find someone to help; at that point we were getting worried about missing the plane.  While that was happening, my husband studied the door latch and saw that it would, in fact, open.  The notice on the door read: Lift Tab, Press Button (or something to that effect).  The door did open and we went through, by which time the kind gentleman had returned with an official to help let us through.  His main concern was not that we had been dumped in the wrong area, but that the door had opened at all, since it was supposed to be securely locked to all except official personnel.  Two or three people bustled about to make sure it was re-locked.

We passengers were shepherded onto a bus, and kept there for at least 15-20 minutes before setting off to find the airplane.  We drove around in seemingly endless circles to the farthest possible point in the airport (another several minutes) before finally approaching the aircraft.  Our seats were together, in a row with no window, and very basic, no pillow or blanket, and no menu, except for one that listed food items for payment.  Because our reservation specified """"meals included,"""" we asked the attendant, who checked a list and said yes, we would receive meals.   Apparently only those on the list were to be fed.  I was appalled to think that on an eight-hour+ flight, some passengers would have to pay (through the nose) for their meals.  The food was about the worst I've ever had on a plane, served in cardboard boxes and all but inedible.  I couldn't even eat the dessert.  
The entertainment was meager: only four or five movies were offered, and very few TV programs.  
On the positive side, all the personnel, including the security officers, were very courteous and nice,  the seats were marginally more comfortable than the worst (Latam) I've experienced, and we got to Boston on time.  Found our bags easily at baggage claim.

“When are you leaving Spain?” she asked.
“On the 18th”, J replied.
“Show me proof,” she demanded.
“There’s our boarding passes and we are returning on your airlines.  Aren’t we in your system?”
“No, the ticket agent said, that’s why I’m asking.” We suspected this could be true, since their website is fairly useless, so  J dug through her pile of papers and eventually found a print out of the itinerary.  This satisfied her temporarily but they were not done with us yet. 
After they checked our suitcases ($55 each) and sent them down the chute, they asked if we any electronics in them.  J had a laptop in hers, so they told us to wait for 5 minutes while they retrieved the suitcase.  Half an hour later they returned with the suitcase so she could remove the laptop.

While we were waiting at the counter for the suitcase to be retrieved, the ticket agent asked the next guy in line for proof he was returning to the US.  Except that he had no return ticket to the US: he was proceeding to other destinations after Barcelona. He begged and pleaded; he was almost in tears but she would not let him use a ticket her airline had obviously sold to him.  Repeatedly he asked why and her answer was always the same - company requirement.
We finally got on board, an hour late, which we learned was because the jet way got stuck. The tail of the plane said “Level” as well as the on board graphics.  The same kind of dour attitude prevailed as at the ticket counter.  We have been on many international trips the past few years - British Airways, Lufthansa, Alaska Air, Delta and United. On all of these international flights you usually get a blanket or earbuds and maybe a snack. On Iberia you got nothing unless you were willing to pay for it-it was as bad as US domestic flights.

The seats and legroom were the same for long haul and short haul. We couldn’t straighten our legs and as soon as the person in front reclined their seat, that was it, game over. 

The flight took just under 11 hours. A few hours in we were served (although ‘chucked’ would be a more apt description of the delivery) a pitiful tray. On it was a stone cold bread bun, unsealed, covered in liquid and other bits of food. Next to that was some sort of lukewarm rubber pasta, no idea what it was supposed to be but I couldn’t get a knife through it so couldn’t eat it. There were no other options. So I ended up eating 3 tiny crackers and that was it. 

No water or juice or anything came around and so we had to go find someone to request some water. You’d think I’d asked for a bar of gold the way the cabin crew reacted and reluctantly handed over a cup of water. 

Nothing at all, no snacks or liquids, came around for the next 8 hours. Then we were served ‘breakfast’. This consisted of a wet bread roll wrapped in cling film containing some sort of meat and cheese. As I had requested vegetarian I asked for an alternative and was told this wouldn’t be possible. So I was left with a fruit pot the size of an espresso shot and a tiny chocolate bar. 

Breakfast at least came with coffee and juice, which was spilled over my partner.

Our electronic ticket and online stated boarding would commence at 13:05 and gate closing time was 13:25. At 12:55 we reached the gate to find it closed. There were quite a few of us so we were let through. 

We reached the plane where we were told my luggage (small hand luggage) would have to be checked in as there was no room left. I explained that I had a very tight schedule with a train to catch afterward but this made no difference. 

We made our way to our seats to find many spaces in the overhead lockers and the one above our seats had 3 coats in it (not ours). The one opposite had small handbags, shopping etc in. I asked a member of the cabin crew why I had to check my case in when there was so much space and she replied ‘well there are other passengers getting on’.

 We then watched as several other passengers got on with large cases and loaded them into the empty spaces, along with coats, shopping, laptops etc despite sitting in seats far away from the overhead lockers located above and opposite our seats. It was baffling.

He had no computer and hand wrote the claim then handed us a copy assuring us we would receive a text message by morning with an update.

At 8:00 pm still no text message or bags, so I called again.  Again 10 minutes before an actual person came on and he told me he believed our bags were in Miami but he could not verify that, but promised me I would recieve a text update shortly.

Sunday morning there were still no bags or even a text message.  So I called again and after 10 minuts I was speaking with the most horrible person I've ever spoken to in my life, """"Maria.""""  Maria told me there was no word on my bags at all, she could not even tell me if they had left Tenerife, if the were in Madrid or if they had made it to Miami.   She told me my questions were a waste of her time and that I simply needed to """"sit and wait"""" for an update.  She refused to let me speak to a Supervisor or even another representative.

The Iberia crew were initially vaguely attentive but that wore off pretty quickly (by the safety brief, more or less). Sadly, their manner of service matched the indifferent attention levels and at times, it seemed like we passengers were nothing but a nuisance, and it would be better if they could just be done with us as quickly as possible so they could retreat to the galley.

When reporting a case missing, the employees at the airport office just shrug their shoulders and tell that such things can happen.
With modern technology and tags on each and every suitcase I am surprised the system still fails.
And now the airlines are even beginning to encourage passengers to place their handluggage together with the suitcases. All trolleys designed especially to fit the required size as hand luggage should go down in the luggage department.
I see huge rygsacks and oversized softer bags accepted as cabin luggage taking up so much place in overhead compartment as well as under the seat storage place. Correct sized handluggage trolleys are rejected.

They were reasonably priced, there’s not a lot of choice when flying to Madrid from anywhere north of London!

The website is extremely confusing to use at times. Adding bags etc at the end, disrupting the prices. Making changes, the website changes from English to Spanish constantly! And when you switch back to English from Spanish, it takes you back to he home screen...frustrating to say the least!

Two changes were made to the outbound flight, and one to the return. We only knew of these changes as we regularly check our emails. If you’re a person who doesn’t...be warned! No other correspondence was made by Iberia (text or phone call, for example). This also affected our parking times which had to then be changed.

At Birmingham airport, check in was quite hectic. Only a couple of staff checking in, and machines to print boarding passes and bag tags. This is the same at Madrid airport, expect a totally electronic check in with plenty of people queuing and looking confused. The boarding passes would also not scan on the machines to allow entry to security checking area....join another long queue!

The planes are not that modern, and quite tatty.
Both flights were delayed, this was on top of the already changed flight times we had originally purchased.

Not my airline of choice, but needs must when flying to Madrid."

Of course, the next check in problem came when we were flying home.  It was the same issue with the data entry and then the error getting our seats upgraded.  I called the number given to me by the representative and some lady goes on a 7 minute rant without pause berating about a 24 hour cut off and being a basic customer.  When I asked to get a word in to ask a question she put me on hold, likely to never answer again.  

I  called back and talked to a guy that was actually willing to answer questions without a problem.   I would only recommend this airline for the savings of money if you only have carry on luggage and short legs.

When my husband, my son and I arrived at Havana airport, to go back home, they told us that the business class was full,  even we bought the tickets months earlier and was just the return flight,  two of us had to go in economic. After useless complaints, my husband and my son got the economic class. I flew business class and I don't have a good memory not only for the bad experience, in fact  the seat was very dirt (I have to admit the seat was dirt also in the outbound flight) and the food was very poor and from one bathroom flowed a terrible smell.  The cabin doors was opened during the night and one pilot went to talk with a woman in business. What kind of security measures! I cannot bring in the airplane a shampoo but they can do everything the want. The company refunded us the class difference but, if I buy a business class ticket, it means that I want to fly business or not?   I read that overbooking is forbidden even illicit, why they don't pay any fine and all the discomfort goes on passenger, and how is possible an overbooking on a return flight from Havana in business? Should be noted that, when we where at the check in in Havana, the employ told us that there were no other flight or solutions for the following days and if we wouldn't have accepted the economic class we had been stuck in Havana at our expenses, what a kind way to put the client at comfort!!! Previously I  flew Iberia in business to Miami and everything was clean and comfortable, so  the general feeling is that  the flight to Havana is a kind of """"we don't care about because is not a cool and rich destination and we are one of the few companies that flies there"""" minimum effort and maximum gain."
10.5950813293457,5.2817702293396,"Iberia Luggage Problems",2,"I booked a return flights for 2 to Madrid on British Airways. The flight was with Iberia who are one of the airlines BA use. My friend asked me to book a case after we booked for hand luggage but it was nigh on impossible to get through to BA and when I eventually got through I was told they couldn’t help and I was to ring Iberia.  I spoke to a young man who said I could not book online. At one point I’m sure he said ‘it’s dangerous’. What!!!   Rang again and spoke to a woman who said she could not do it as there are no Iberia desks at Heathrow.  Finally spoke to someone at BA who explained why I could not book a case online.  It took him 30 minutes explaining and extolling the virtues of BA and how much more I could take in hand luggage than other airlines allowed.  He then said the flights were very cheap but I told him as I could not check in a case online which would have been £20.00 compared to £40.00 each way at the airport, it would add another £80 to the flights, so it would not be so cheap. 
I tried checking in online 24 hours before as instructed on the app, but it did not recognise the booking. My friend tried the next day and we still couldn’t check in.  We arrived at Heathrow and tried booking in at the relevant machines and it still would not accept the booking.  We were then diverted to the Iberia check in, the ones we were told they did not have at Heathrow.  We explained to a young man what had happened and he said the website wasn't working properly and Iberia had been told about this numerous times over the past year.  Two people who were in earshot said they had booked direct with Iberia and they could not check in. So I don’t think it’s because we booked through BA.  We were then told that our cases would be put in the hold as the plane was full because of BA strikes 2-3 days before.  I wasn’t happy as I could not check a case in online now I’m being told my case should go in the hold, albeit free of charge. When we got on the plane there was plenty of room for our cases.
When we landed we were taken by shuttle buses to arrivals, or so we thought. We were actually dropped of at departures. People were walking down the stairs as we were all going up.  When we asked anyone for help we were pointed in a general direction. My friend and I, together with 2 men who were also on our flight, walked around for an hour. We finally found the luggage carousel we needed at the furtherest point.
On our return, we arrived 2hrs 30mins before our flight. We went to the check in machines. This time it recognised our booking, great or so we thought. We booked our seats next to each other, there were plenty available, probably because no one could check in online.  We pushed the button to get our boarding passes only to see a message saying it did not recognise the booking, yet it had all our information.   We asked a lady working for Iberia but she just told us to use the machine that we told her didn’t work for us and then I spoke to a man who explained that the system gets overloaded in summer.  This is September not July/August.  Then he said maybe it wanted more information.  What information, my blood group!!!  We arrived at the relevant desk after queuing for nearly an hour and explained that we couldn’t check in at the machines. We obviously didn’t look very happy.  She gave us our boarding passes and we said thank you and walked away but I turned around and caught the young lady pulling a face at her colleague.  She should have waited till we were out of sight. She looked suitably embarrassed. On route to the terminal my friend gave me my boarding pass, she was in seat 14E and I was in 51E. The young lady never said anything about the seating or gave us any indication that one of us was at the front of the plane and one at the back.   Madrid Airport is awful to get around, even a couple from Madrid agreed with us on that point.  I think we could have walked to London quicker.  The flights were fine but both airlines’s customer service was appalling.  My friend flies with BA all the time but it was my first time with them and Iberia.   Sadly it will be my last.

The Iberia Express flight from TCS to Madrid was fine, though the boarding was badly handled. Brief, mumbled introductions only in Castilian, indicating boarding by groups, then a second burst of mumbling that actually they'd board people without hand luggage first. No English, changes, and lots of standing in the gangway.

But that was just the appetizer. For my second leg to Heathrow, I got a cheery gate number e-mail at 7:15 AM that neglected to mention that the flight had officially been cancelled at 6:45. Neither did the boarding announcement board at Madrid airport. The plane was there at the gate... but no gate staff. Then, 15 minute before boarding, the monitors suddenly showed 'cancelled'. I used the app to find that I had been rerouted to London via Munich (no e-mail). Of course, I didn't have a boarding pass to Munich or for Munich-London, and there was still no one at the gate. So about 90 people rushed to the nearest Iberia service desk... where 2 people VERY slowly started handing out new boarding passes. Since my Munich boarding was in 15 minutes, I just went to the gate, and the one useful Iberia staffer printed my itinerary to Munich and said I could board with that. 

So off to Munich (with no boarding pass and no gate information on the connecting BA flight to London). I asked at the gate at deplaning how to get to my connecting gate... what a mistake! A rude, bored, and useless young lady announced she was only responsible for Iberia (I was an Iberia passenger just off an Iberia flight!), and ignored me. Wow!

I did find my gate, and the BA staff for that flight were actually competent and professional... what a change!

Naturally, the re-routing (no reason was every given for the cancellation) meant I missed my connection in London, meaning the cost of hotel room and a change fee on that flight. I've sent off my request for compensation to Iberia, but fully expect them to deny it for some bogus reason, or for no reason at all (like the no reason they gave for cancelling my connection in the first place).

If I travel with hand luggage it’s because i want the freedom to have control over my things.

I'm traveling a lot with Luft Hansa and they never have problem with this. 
Even when they are full and on business days when most of the passengers don't check in and all have hand luggage. 
Of course you need to use the space under the seat but it's never a problem. I will take a second thought next time i'm flying to avoid Iberia if they don't create a better rutin for this.

Where to begin....My wife requires a wheelchair when she has to walk extreme distances. In case you are not aware of it, the Madrid Airport is Gigantic. Unlike other airlines, the place where you go to get your wheelchair service is very difficult to find and there is no signage pointing you in the right direction. When we finally got there ( about 1/4 mile walk) there was a line to check in for your reserved wheelchair. A LINE for people who need a wheelchair - what's wrong with that picture! One man is very slowly signing in each person and the line is quite a wait - people who need wheelchairs are STANDING ON A SLOW AND LONG LINE!!!  On the return we get off the plane and search for our reserved wheelchair but it is no where in sight. We enter the terminal where we are told that we are not eligible for a wheelchair because we managed to get off the plane by ourselves. The footnote to that is when you reserve a wheelchair on line they ask you to specify if you need help onto the plane or if you only need it to travel long distances at the airport. We told them up front we only needed it for the distances but now they want to penalize us because we got off the plane without it!!???!!! Ultimately the man in charge got us a wheelchair but made it clear he was doing us a favor. On top of that, I had paid for upgraded seats but when they checked us in they gave us other seats and I didn't notice. Turns out NO ONE but the check in counter can alter that.???  No one????  On other airlines, like Delta, it could have been handled by the counter at the gate but not with Iberia. CONCLUSION - The management of Iberia really doesn't have any concern for its passengers. They want to sell you but as soon as your sold they want to herd you like cattle and show little, if any, feelings for the humans they are transporting.

Boith airlines have the usual 'skynnyas paper torture seats' which are uncomfortable to sit in let alone sleep (too short, hard as a slab of concrete). However, legroom a tad better at SN, cramped at Iberia with my legs against the front seat (I'm 1m78). Do not try to put one leg on the corridor, it will inevitably collide with the bulldozer Iberia ladies roaming the plane.
Catering: minimal at SN (a miserable little warp + one drink dspite a flex ticket costing an arm and a leg), non existent at Iberia, even a glass of water, unless you pay.
Luggage: both annnoying, carry-ons requested to go onthe hold after a few passengers in. At Iberia I must note I had to put a piece on hold (a brought back a bottle of precious Venezuelan rhum), despte what was mentioned on the ticket, carried for free.
Plane: nice clean A319 at SN, but the larger A321 of Iberia was worn (reading spot not workig, erratic USB charging port), A/C not very good (too hot with some intermittent icy air). 
Staff not very friendly, they looked as unhappy as the passengers, even the SN hostesses are friendlier.
Overall experience: Iberia experience not much different than a vulgar low cost à la Ryanair. 
One special annoyance are the stridend/endless/repetitive/uninteresting announcements of the Spanish ladies blasted on your ears at full volume for safety (OK, OK, I can understand), food (paying), Wifi (paying), tax free boutique (you guessed), take-off, we are arriving, blabla from the flight deck, wherever blabla, all in  languages...So do not even try to sleep on your torture tiny chair.

We purchased the basic economy fare because of the low price.  In retrospect, I would spend more and select my seat at time of booking.  With Iberia, you cannot select your economy seat until 24 hours in advance.  Two years ago when we flew Iberia to Madrid, we ended up with great seats when we checked-in online 24 hours in advance.  This year, we had good luck doing that with our seats from LAX to Madrid, but it was a nightmare on the way home.  Also, if you plan on checking luggage, I would NOT pay to check it in advance.  When we checked in for our flight in L.A., we were not charged a penny for  checked bags (despite what it said on the website), however, when we checked in for our return flight, we were charged for the bags.  Maybe we were lucky in L.A., or maybe Iberia is inconsistent in their checked bag policy.  I always think it's worth taking a shot at the counter because a little friendly banter can go a long way in terms of avoiding charges.

Coming home, we tried dozens and dozens of times to check-in online but we could not do it.  Three tickets had been purchased together on one credit card, so check-in required all three of us to check-in at once.  Unfortunately, although all the information for all three travelers was showing and was correct, we were caught in a glitch that could not be corrected.  For one traveler, we kept receiving an error message asking us to enter the country of issuance of his passport, despite the fact that the country of issuance was filled out.  No matter how many times we entered """"USA"""" (something that had been entered when we purchased the tickets), none of us could check in because the site would not accept the information.  I even had a representative from Expedia contact the airline.  Per the first Iberia agent, and her supervisor (allegedly), they could see that """"USA"""" was in the system but they could not override it. As a result, none of us could check-in in advance.  As a result, when we checked-in at the airport, two of us ended up with center seats for the flight, despite the supervisor taking our requests for two aisle and one window seat.   That was not the only problem with Iberia's website, which needs to be re-done in its entirety.   It is an absolute nightmare, as you will learn if you book a flight on Iberia for more than one person.

As for the flight itself, even in the middle seats, it was not bad.  The seats were actually fairly comfortable.  The entertainment system is also good.  When it comes to meal service, Iberia is efficient.  Within about two hours of take-off, lunch was served (this would have been roughly 2:30 p.m.).  It was as good as you expect airline food to be.  However, if you want more than one glass of wine or beer, ask for it the first time they offer it or you will not get another one.  The only beverage they offer more than once is coffee.  Somewhere around six hours later, they brought a snack box out, and about two hours before landing they served sandwiches.  Water, coffee and juice were about the only beverages offered.  In between meals, you rarely see a flight attendant.  They're not the friendliest.

After waiting over TWO HOURS in the lost luggage line, they assure us it will be delivered the next day, probably on their 1st delivery @ 8:00 am, since they already know where it is. Well, we kept checking our texts and emails all day and finally got one that said it will be delivered between 20:00-23:00. Sweet!! We’ve been waiting at our apartment and nothing came. It’s now a day later and nothing yet. So, we’ve spent over 1/2 our time in Barcelona worrying about his luggage and having to hunt down new power adapters. What a crummy way to start a 2 month European dream vacation. Fingers crossed that we finally get his luggage tomorrow!!"

After exhaustion of waiting in line with no help from Iberia we called our travel agent.  They said the only option was for to either continue waiting or book another flight.  We decided to book another flight because otherwise we were going to be stuck in Madrid overnight.  Only 2 flights left that day.  We spent $400 dollars on 4 flights and got the heck out.  We then requested a refund from Iberia.  You can not talk with anyone you had to file an online complaint and wait 21 days for a response.  They asked us to forgive the mishap and did not refund our money.  What terrible Customer Service!!!!!  Think Twice before you fly Iberia!!!"

The main difference was luggage (and maybe that was our fault).  On the trip over to Rome, we attempted to carry-on as much luggage as possible on the cheapest seats available.  Well, for that price, Iberia accommodated us with as little luggage and seating space as possible.  There wasn't any leg room if you stored a carry-on underneath your seat.  And the standard economy seats seem built to provide space for a child. 
On our flight home, we paid extra to check-in as much luggage as possible and upgraded our seats to get that extra leg room.  And, even with that, we had a problem with Iberia as they initially placed us in standard economy seats.  We argued with them for 10 minutes (and showed them our receipts for upgraded seats) before we were seated appropriately.  And that re-arrangement of passengers on a full flight initially other explanations (and some arguments)  before the passengers on this flight were finally settled in.  So, the moral of my story is to only take a carry-on that will fit in the overhead compartments, and upgrade your seat(s) to one that provides more leg room."

We were left waiting until 13.15!!! Until we left. It was an Iberia express flight so the food and beverages were being charged. Multiple people missing their connecting flights in Madrid. I was checking out of the airport to spend a night in Madrid. Waiting for luggage was another disaster. Our luggage was announced on the screen to be already on the belt - which was not true. Only a few suitcases were on the belt, the rest of us had to wait an additional 40 minutes before our luggage arrived. Worst experience ever. 

Flight from Madrid to Mexico: since this is a flight carried out by Iberia, instead of Iberia Express, I was hoping that the check-in and boarding went as smooth or even better than the day before. Check in was fine, boarding unfortunately was not. We are delayed immediately at boarding while the plane is waiting outside and luggage is being loaded. They want people to rush to the gate at 8.00 (on the information screens) when we are just leaving at 9.40.

We arrived at the airport early so as to make certain that everything went smoothly.  Our first disappointment was when, at 4:00 p.m., we learned that no one would be at the Iberian counter until 8:30 p.m. for an 11:10 p.m. flight.  So, we had to sit in the airport lobby for more than 4 hours.  When we noticed that people were queuing for the flight, we saw that the Iberian signs had been replaced by signs reading """"Level Airlines"""".  Having no idea what happened to Iberian, I approached the agent to ask and was told, quite rudely, that Iberian had subbed the flight to Level Airlines.  

We got into the queue because we had one bag to check and needed to check in and get seat assignments.  Our next shock was that it cost us $55.00 to check the bag!  Then we learned that our seat assignments were nothing like what we had requested and, after some hassle, were able to get seats near, but not next to, each other (fortunately, another passenger was willing to switch seats so that we could, in fact, sit together for the 7 hour flight.

Next, came dinner service -- which, passed right by us.  I stopped the flight attendant to ask about dinner and was asked whether we had ordered and paid for it ahead of time?  I said that we had not and she said that we could buy something from the flight menu if we wanted dinner.  I asked for a Diet Coke and was told that it was 5 euros!  It turns out that the ONLY thing that was FREE on the flight was WATER.  Can you imagine a 7 hour flight with no services at all???  At the conclusion of the flight, I asked why there were no services and was told that Level is a budget airline and the decision had been made to allow people to choose what they wanted to pay for.  She told me that, had we flown Iberian, we would have had full service.

At no time, from the time I booked the flight to check-in, was I made aware that we would not be flying Iberian airlines.

On the return journey to Heathrow I booked exit seats so that we had more space. This time the plane was older and the seats were much more comfortable. So... I know that Iberia is a Spanish airline but this was my bug bear- the captain (on both flights) would say what he had to say first in Spanish and then in English. When they were speaking in English it’s was as if they couldn’t spit the words out fast enough and you couldn’t make out a word they were saying. It’s as if they were sick of repeating the same thing twice. 
Cabin crew were Spanish and I found them to be quite abrupt(both flights) which surprised me as the Spanish people I had encountered in Madrid were extremely friendly.

Unfortunately, our experience on July 31, 2019, proved to be far below our expectations. While we understand that there can be unforeseen delays during air travel, the length of the delay and the manner in which it was handled left much to be desired. The delay caused us to miss an entire day of our trip, which we spent in Madrid airport rather than at  our destination. 

We were scheduled to fly at 17:05 from JFK to MAD, where we were to connect to Palermo on an Iberia flight at 8:35 on August 1, 2019. Upon our arrival at JFK, we observed that the flight was delayed until 18:30. This raised significant concern as we feared we would miss our connecting flight, but we were assured by Iberia agents that we would still make our connecting flight despite the delay.

We waited in Terminal 7 at JFK for information about our flight. Surprisingly, there were no gate agents available to provide any information regarding what time the flight would take off. An agent finally arrived at the gate around 18:15 and stated that the flight would depart at 19:35. Once again, we were assured by an agent that we would make our connecting flight and she refused to reschedule our connecting flight when we asked her to do so.

We waited in a chaotic crowd to board the plane. We boarded our flight and sat down in our seats at 19:30; however, the  flight did not depart JFK for another hour and a half, until 21:05. Again, there were no announcements made regarding the reason for the delay. 

We arrived in Madrid and met with an agent regarding the connecting flight we missed due to the delay. We were told our best option was to take an additional two flights, one from Madrid to Milan, followed by Milan to Palermo using what we were told was Bulgaria Airlines. We were only provided with a new itinerary for this flight. We were told we would have to find the airline upon landing to receive our boarding passes.

We asked multiple agents throughout our eight hour delay in Madrid what to do to ensure that our bags were moved along with us, and each stated, “Don’t worry it is our job to get the bags on the plane.”

The flight from Milan to Palermo concerned us because there were only 55 minutes between the flights. When we arrived in Milan an hour late due to another delayed Iberia flight, we frantically searched for Bulgaria Airlines. There was not a single flight by this airline. Desperately, we stopped at an Alitalia information desk and showed them the booking details Iberia had provided. 

While preparing to leave for Madrid, we double checked with the gate agent to ensure our bags were on the plane. She looked at our reservation and told us our bags were sitting downstairs unaccounted for. Thankfully, the agent was kind enough to issue an alert through the system that our bags needed to be onboard our flight. Unfortunately, our baggage was left in Madrid and did not make it on the plane. 

We eventually landed in Palermo 13 hours later than our original scheduled arrival time and our luggage was not delivered. This was due to our baggage not being correctly recoded after our new connecting flight was assigned. 

We did not receive our bags until over a week after we arrived home which was 21 and 23 respectively from when they were originally lost. This added unneeded stress and aggravation. We have reached out to Madrid airport and Iberia about the missing luggage and have found the customer service agents to be rude, even to the point of being hung up on so as to avoid assisting us.

Despite having shown them my other ID cards and a copy of the police report stating that my credit card was stolen, the entirely rude and arrogant Iberia staff at the airport demanded that I had to buy a new ticket- which I did in desperation because I had to get this flight. After this humiliating experience I had sworn to never use Iberia again. Unfortunately, I recently had to buy a ticket for my wife and the only connection available was with Iberia. When I tried to purchase the ticket online, the booking could not be completed and I had to try again. Nevertheless, the money was withdrawn from my account - without having received a ticket or even a confirmation, of course. Some minutes later, I was able to purchase the same ticket with even the same seat number again - and I was charged a second time. Since then, I have tried to get Iberia to return my money.  Never have I experienced such a level of rudeness, incompetence and plain absurdity! The Iberia experience is a unique and outstanding example of incompetence and irresponsibility. Zero stars."

As i knew what Iberia was capable of, I booked my flight to Madrid a day earlier, just in case, I had to take a later flight, or something happened. Indeed, you would never be bored with Iberia! Best entertainment guaranteed!

The flight at 1350 was overbooked, and at check-in, a friendly employee informed me, but also reassured me that they would make sure I got to Madrid. I had a flight to Norway scheduled the day after, so I was a bit worried. 

After calling and checking with the agencies, they told me they could not do anything, and basically the Tripmonster employee told me that it was silly the flight was overbooked and they could not do anything to help me. I had no rights, despite the fact that i had paid for a flight that cost me more than 200 euros.

Needless to say, I was upset, and tried to stay calm. I teared up on a multiple occoasions, I saw the Spaniards around me - they managed to keep a straight face. I asked all the employees what could be done, they said I had to wait. So I waited and waited.

There was that blond lady, whom I also met at the check in, who was very nice, and reassured me again, a few times, along with a hug, that I would fly to Madrid and I would even sleep ther. I think she deserves a raise! In the end, she indeed made sure. She said  - I would get to fly because  I was kind. 

That made me think, dear Iberia, are your employees subject to bullying and rude behavior due to your idiotic decisions? You are so messy, I just wonder how you are still in business, and I hope someone founded a competitor company, hope it is someone from abroad, so that at least your employees could get a better alternative and the passengers get to fly without experiencing emotional damages!

They basically would not show me where I could dump the trash and insisted I had to take it back to my seat until they were ready to take it from me.

We gave the man our Qantas Frequent Flyer number which was printed on our boarding pass, but we were told that they couldn't allocate us seat numbers as flight IB3093 was over booked by 10 people. But we should go through security anyway to the departure lounge in case lots of people didn't turn up. He said if we couldn't get on our flight which was booked 8 months ago, we would be compensated up to 300 Euros and get on a later flight. So we went to gate 7 to be first in the queue when boarding commenced. When boarding commenced we were told to go to the back of the queue. Then at 5 minutes before takeoff we were told they are no availability for us and to wait while they sorted the matter out. This took about 20 minutes and we were told to go up to gate 31 where someone would meet us with new boarding passes for a later flight. A lady turned up around 1pm and was most apologetic about the overbooking and mentioned that the next Iberia flight was overbooked with 14 people. So she had arranged for us to fly to Madrid with TAP Air Portugal and gave us boarding passes (without Qantas Frequent Flyer numbers as TAP is not in the One World Alliance) for the 1:45pm flight TP1010 from gate 33. This TAP flight left 15 minutes late, so overall we arrived in Madrid one and a half hours late and without any Qantas frequent flyer points. On arrival at Madrid we had to catch a bus from terminal 2 to the Iberia office in terminal 4 to get a token 125 Euro Visa Card payment for the inconvenience caused, I wouldn't recommend flying with any airline like Iberia which makes a habit of overbooking.

However, I will never trust or recommend Iberia, they are by far the WORST airline I’ve ever used. It would be 0 stars if I could. It all started with our outbound flight from Miami to Madrid. We purchased premium economy and  they decided to sit the three of us, including our 2 yr old son separately. Come on it’s a 2 year old, by regulation he has to sit next to one of his parents. But this was just the start. On our return trip when we got to the counter at Madrid they inform us that the flight is overbooked and we have been placed on standby. We had actually purchased premium economy seats for our vacation, which are almost 3 times the cost of economy and had also previously selected and paid for seats online to ensure we were together. Regardless they inform us that we had been placed in standby and that this seems to be a common occurrence lately. The gentleman on the check-in desk managed to find us tickets in coach and we were very grateful, however there is a major price difference, approximately $1000 per ticket or so... he informed us that he was not authorized to give us the refund and to head on to customer service. The first window for customer service tells us there nothing they can do, that it must be online. Online / over the phone tells me there’s nothing they can or will do, tough luck. The next service representative in Madrid, Maria, became very rude towards my wife and refused to acknowledge or guide us with our concerns. She yelled at us that there would be no refund of our money and it was up to us wether we wanted to leave in the flight or not for the same price we had paid, mind you a forced and uncompensated downgrade. We decided to leave on the flight and figure it out independently thru Amex since we made the purchase on their site. American Express started an investigation. At the gate we encountered several Spanish families from either premium economy and/or business class that had been downgraded as well without compensation or refund. Apparently this is not unsual for Iberia... on the return flight the service was appalling and rude yet again. To the point that my wife was even physically pushed to the side by one of the attendants when she was trying to calm our 2 yo son near the back of the plane.

Anyway, the flight itself wasn’t the problem really. It was the Baggage going missing for a week. I decided to make a few calls the day after we flew to see if I could see if they had located the bags and that they were on their way (8 bags in total as 8 of us flew to Gran Canaria). All I got was they could only find one bag, the other seven were missing. After being on the phone for 3 and half hours a gentleman told me that all 8 bags arrived at Heathrow 8:25am on Saturday which he checked the flight number and he told me they were organising delivery – THIS WAS A HUGE LIE. 
A few more phone calls were exchanged, and delivery time was made, On Tuesday – one bag out of eight came and it was destroyed ripped open and battered. I was livid, I rang Iberia to have a lady called Marther pick up the phone, who told me all the bags were at Heathrow a second lie, she was rude… unhelpful and told me I had to go to the airport to sort it? Now I knew they were lying because the bag which had come said the time it arrived and when it flew in which was the day before they delivered it – Monday not Saturday. Their delivery driver also told us that they can only keep the bags for a certain amount of time, or they get fined. I rang again later and they told us they had located all the other 7 bags and they would be delivered on Thursday. 
Thursday came we received a text saying they would come between 21:59pm – 00.02am so we waited, to only receive four more other suitcases. Which again had said they flew in the day before they were delivered… So in total three suitcases were still missing, by this time I had lost my patience. I rang Iberia again… to speak to a lady called Rajia (think that’s what she said). Who shouted at me? Sorry last I checked this was Iberias mistake? Not Mine! She was rude and unhelpful. So I put the phone down because she was just shouting at me and I refused to be sat and shouted at for something which is not my mistake! 
Friday came and after work I rang a lady who located all the final three suitcases and told me I had to go and pick them up (although Iberia said they would deliver every single one to us when we landed without them) at this point I was extremely fed up so I just went hoping for the best. At Heathrow I came across the first polite and helpful member of staff that works for Iberia his name was Gillisanin (think that’s how it was spelt) and he is an absolute star. He instantly was on it, he took my number and went down to baggage and came back within an hourish with all the bags most efficient staff member. I was over the moon. 
It should not have taken 40 phone calls to get my bags back. I shouldn’t of had to drive to pick them up when it was their mistake. The bags are battered to pieces.  The staff are rude, incompetent and the most unhelpful people ive ever met (accept the gentleman at the airport who I spoke to yesterday wish more staff were like him!!).

This empowerment is then reflected as a part of them and how they treat others and to feel the frustration of the customer. If the reader agrees with these values, then Iberia Air is not for you.
My wife promised her young nephew his first trip to Europe, As this was his first long flight, she purchased two seats next to each other. The customer service agent at BOS would not honor these seats and said only one seat was paid. Unless one has a bladder issue, who would pay an extra $67 to sit two rows in front of the toilet at the back of the plane? She asked to speak to the manager. The manager would not view the documents proving the seats were purchased and began venting her anger on my wife, humiliating her in public and in front of her nephew and this went on for 10 minutes as the line grew longer. Unfortunately, her badge was reversed and so her name was not up front. I wrote to Iberia Facebook customer service and they responded days later to fill out a form. I also wrote to a VP and the CEO and they never responded or forwarded the email to exec. customer service which is normally the protocol, especially when one of their employees goes off the loose end. The plane ride to Madrid was fine except the airline attendants were slow to answer and a request for warm tea meant serve it when it is late and tepid.
On the flight from MAD to ARN, the refreshments were free. From ARN to MAD the refreshments were not free. 
In MAD at the ticket counter, they were again separated although they were previously assured in BOS that they would sit together on return. 
If there were more ways for an airline to say, Please no longer fly us, we are not worthy, it is few and far between. Perhaps their actions said it for them and we are more than convinced they have it right for once.  The need for leadership and employees to """"feel the need of frustration"""" of the customer was not meant as fermenting it, but alleviating it. Or maybe it is another Monday at Iberia  Air HQ,"

The long wait to check combined with their unfriendliness really made this flight very special (Sarcasm).

So we had to find Iberia's customer service and explain the situation, It took 3hrs of standing in front this old incompetent lady to finally reroute out flight from non stop flight to go though NY. The women kept arguing as if it was our fault to check in our carry on, when it should've been their staff to be blamed for not doing their job.

How did it go from $100 to $490.... the only thing the lady could say was """"it's how your ticket was booked mam."""" It was outrageous. For $600 I could have gone with KLM or any other airline because they are all , except for American Airlines and United, better than this.

The plane is mediocre, the seats not that great and not much room. I'm comparing to KLM, Qatar Airways, Delta, Avianca, which are good airlines. Iberia does not fall in this category. 

Chicken or pasta.. if you travel a lot, you are aware that these are almost your options, Veg and nonveg.

We had issues with confirming flights even before we left for our trip - I had to call several times to get info on our flights.  We were in Capri prior to going to Naples for the flight and literally spent over an hour trying to get checked in on line.  We finally had our hotel concierge call and they were told that the website had had a glitch for several days and we couldn’t check in on-line - we had to get boarding passes at the airport.  We got to airport by 5:30 am and didn’t have an issue fortunately.  The first flight to Madrid was a smaller plane and extremely cramped, old and worn. My husband could barely get his legs to fit into the seat.  The flight was over 2 hours and they didn’t serve anything to drink or eat. Our next flight was from Madrid to Miami in Premium Economy. They delayed the flight for about an hour even though the plane had been there for hours - no explanation and no announcement.  Once aboard, the seats were an improvement as they were wider and more legroom but not nearly as much as other airlines’ Premium economy.  The seats were hard though and hurt both my husband and my backs.  I sat in the blanket they provided the whole way to cushion the seat.  The attitude of the crew except for one nice flight attendant was nasty and rude.  They gave us 2 small cups of water and one small bottle for the 10 hour flight.  We were given a mediocre chicken dish for lunch and a bagel with ham and cheese for a snack before we landed.  No other snacks were offered throughout the flight. Premium is just behind Business class and there is lavatory between them.  The only other lavatories were all the way in the back by economy or in First class. The male flight attendant forbade anyone in Premium to use the lavatory closest to us- claiming it was only  for Business. Meanwhile the lav’s in Economy were a disaster about 7 hours into the flight- the sink was stopped up, almost no tissue and paper the floor was soaked with urine.  We travel quite a bit and other than a bad Alitalia night flight , we have never had such a bad overall experience on an International flight.

On the plus side, the movie selection and food was great. My husband and I were traveling with our 2 teen sons. we had the exit row and the row behind - 2 in each row with what looked like a 3rd empty seat. When we got to the gate my husband and I were told we were being """"upgraded"""" so Our seats had been changed. When we got on the plane, we found that not only were we not upgraded but we were moved away from our kids and put in a row on the side with crowed legroom, leaving the exit row empty. At the time I was wearing a boot on my foot so was told that this is the reason I was moved, although I would later find an email telling me of the change that was delivered prior to our arrival so they wouldn't have known. I asked a flight attendant if our row could just be switched with our kids and they could have the exit row. She told me no and that it was a full flight. As we were getting ready to take off, an elderly couple asked to be moved into our original seats in the exit row and I was really angry about that. I voiced my complaint to the attendants who apologized but there was nothing to be done. Just did not seem like a fair practice to be switched at the gate without explanation and for someone else less capable of taking care of the exit row to be able to sit there. When it is very obvious that a flight is not full, the attendants shouldn't tell people it is. We also had a flight from Dublin to Madrid on the express which was very uncomfortable."

After the flight, when we went to the counter to get that preference put in their system so we have it for our return flight, while the person was looking into computer, I casually mentioned the incident that happened in flight, she refused to help me by saying it is your meal preference and I should call finnair since I booked through them.

The plane is VERY old, no TV’s in back of seats, only in isles, and you can’t even watch them because half the planes sound wasn’t working.

First, since they unhelpfully messed up our luggage situation, I purchased a duffle bag in Mallorca to carry on things we purchased on our vacation rather than risk them in a checked back prone to loss per numerous other's experiences. It actually turned out to be unnecessary as our luggage went everywhere we went. Yet, they still managed to nearly cause us to be stranded in Madrid.

Our flight out of Mallorca departed about 20 minutes later than expected with no warning or explanation. Our layover in Madrid was only 1:25, so I was already getting concerned. But I thought heading toward the US could not be nearly as bad as heading away. I was wrong. Madrid is a massive airport that operates as if they are herding cattle. There is ZERO organization. By the time we landed, we had 1 hour to make our connection, but first, we had to sweat to death in a madly chaotic passport control line then get to another terminal that was (by signage) 24 minutes away. We were mere feet from our gate after running through the airport when we got to yet another point where Iberia had to take yet another look at our boarding passes and passports. This was not the gate mind you but a point prior to the gate. It was at this location that Iberia decided to pull my wife aside for a random pat-down, swabbing, and all that other TSA type BS which we had already gone through in Mallorca. My son and I waited at the gate for this. I asked the gate attendant when they were closing the doors. Two minutes was the answer I was given. I then asked how long that security check would take. 4-5 minutes was the answer I was given. WHAT??? Their staff absolutely don't care if they are rude or they ruin your day or your vacation. They don't care if they separate families. In the end, my wife made it and the attendant was full of BS. People still boarded the plane for at least 15 or more minutes after that point. Their employees honestly have no clue what is supposed to happen and when. NONE.

So now, I will reiterate, DO NOT FLY Iberia if you don't have an enormous time cushion. They will stress you to the point of rage or a nervous breakdown. Second, if you can help it, do not make a connecting reservation in Madrid. The worst run international airport I have ever passed through. 

Our next stop was JFK. As old and massive as that airport is, I must say the customs lines were orderly, staff and customs agents were helpful, and yes, it is a busy airport but at no time were we ever left to feel neglected or uninformed.

During our entire time in line, no agent gave an update of the process.  When we neared the counter, a manager was standing near the front of the line.  We had been in line for about 3 hours at this time.  I asked him about the process and he informed me that they would not be re-booking us at this time and were only providing assistance to those needing hotels.  I asked him why this was not announced and he replied that it had.  I responded that this was not true and he stated that he did not need to talk to me.

Maybe we were unfortunate to have some turbulence at ALL the 4 flights during takeoff/landing. This I really think was a misfortune, cause Iberia is a flagship company, so I assume it was a coincidence.
But one thing is for sure, TAP is WAY better, and give you food according to the flight duration and time of day. Even at short flights you will have a snack or even dinner/lunch if it's the time for that.
EasyJet give you the same level of confort and services at a usually lower price."

Aircraft were an A320 and A320NEO and both had the standard intra European business class seat with a spare seat between the window and aisle. On both flights I received quite a substantial meal which was delicious. Service was very good and English was perfect, which I appreciated not being a Spanish speaker on a Spanish airline. My only gripe was check in Marrakech took forever and Iberia kept checking in economy class passengers despite there being a huge hold up with the Business class queue.Otherwise a great experience and I will not hesitate to fly Iberia again in Europe."

I say crazy because everyone -- native, non-native -- walks into you and you'd better get out of the way or they'll walk right into you without a care in the world.
Other than the airport, which was a stopover on the way to Italy, the airline is great. We had a lot of leg room, decent meals, lots of friendly service. Our flight on Iberia to Rome from Madrid was shorter but just as nice. I would definitely fly Iberia again. On the way home, we flew AA which was horrible and squeezed in as many seats as possible to make a buck. Result -- uncomfortable for 9 hours. Flying Iberia was nice. Give yourself an hour in the Madrid airport to get to a connecting flight -- they are not near each other, even if it's the same airline. It took us about an hour but once we got there, we enjoyed our second Iberia flight."

As we show up to the airport to check in ( online was not allowed) we stood for 1 hour at the desk while the agent tried to check the 6 of us in. I kept asking what was wrong, where I was told hold on, wait, I don’t know. Finally she says she can check all of us In but my niece can not be booked for the 2nd part of our flight from Madrid to JFK. She told me she did not know why and I would need to consult with the help desk in Madrid. Not very comforting obviously. I called American Airlines who told me to call Iberia who told me it’s Americans issue. We had to board and take off so I resolved to deal with it in Madrid. Once in Madrid ( with 1.5 hour layover) I stood in the Iberia CS line for well over 45 minutes only to be told we just missed the check in! After a nervous breakdown they agreed to give her a ticket ( hand written) and all 6 of us with a small child and carryons  were told to “RUN” to our gate. It’s a 23 minute walk to our gate. We ran the entire way and made it as the gate was closing. Drenched in sweat we boarded our plane! Hurray! The 7 hour flight wasn’t bad, the plane was clean and had a decent entertainment system. The flight crew were not  very nice and short with my children as well as myself with any question asked. I however had a very nice attendant from business class offer me some food because I have celiacs and they couldn’t accommodate my meal request. The attendants in my seating area did not care at all and didn’t offer any ideas. In addition I couldn’t purchase food either because they do not offer it. Once we landed we stood around for another hour waiting for our luggage. Guess what....It wasn’t there! Apparently it was still in Madrid! Actually 1 bag made it. The rest were still in Madrid. We did have a very nice person help us with our claim and we did get our bags a day and a half later. My Tumi suitcase was bashed in on one side but other than that, everything was accounted for. It was seriously insane, the entire experience. We thought by spending more with a reputable airline we would have a hassle free trip... we thought wrong."

To save space the airline uses a thinly padded seat, however they do recline generously.  The in flight entertainment systems worked well and were full of a variety of movies, TV shows and music.  I do recommend spending the extra money in order to select your seat in advance as these flights tend to sell out and even over book.  The flight attendants were moderately helpful.

I have attempted to mitigate the raw, basic experience of our 11-hour trip from MEX to MAD by buying Exit Row seats. The trade-off for a little more leg room is the right to a stern lecture from a member of the cabin crew who is required to make sure that you understand the additional responsibilities you have taken on. You are shown how to open the door in case of emergency. You are forbidden to stow your carry-ons anywhere except the overhead locker and you have to satisfy the crew that you are in full possession of all your mental and physical capacities. Another benefit is that now, the seat in front of you is too far away for the fold-down table to be accessible so you must resort to the little fold-out thing which hides in your arm-rest. It provides an horizontal surface just big enough for the meal which will be handed out, but not quite big enough to move your arm from the metal barquette of pasta directly below to your mouth. It would be unfair to single out Iberia as the only airline delivering this kind of no-frills experience. They must all get together on a regular basis to define standard minimum comfort levels. They don’t even make money on us Eco travelers. Airlines rely on selling Business Class and above to make a profit.

 If you are not flying in business, the flights depending on the route are quite average.

First, I'll say everything was on time. That is the positive. Everything besides that was a mess. 

The flight from JFK to Madrid was on time, but the itinerary had just 1:20 layover before our connecting flight to Mallorca. The line for passport control was mass chaos. Then we had to take a train to another terminal that was 28 minutes away. Then go through airport security. We made it to the gate the minute of departure, and was told by the gate attendant, """"Gone. Nothing we can do"""". There was zero chance of making that flight given the customs time and process, so I can’t fathom why it was chosen as the connection by the airline. We had to goad the location out of them to the customer service desk. We get there and there is one other couple waiting that were also in our flight having the exact same experience. After waiting about 20 minutes, they institute a take-a-number rule and proceed to try to take care of all business class customers firsts instead of the original queue order. I was not about to let that go down, and basically led a charge of the line to take us in order. They did, and we were booked on the next flight out 3 hours later. We were told our luggage would travel with us. Ha!! I wasn't sure how that was going to take place, but I tried to give the benefit of the doubt. When we arrived in Palma, our luggage was not on the carousel. Neither was that other couple's I mentioned. Luckily, they found the Iberia service desk and their luggage. We found two of our bags standing side-by-side there. As far as the third, they refused to provide any help and shooed us away. We didn’t know what to do or who to ask. So we finally made our way down to customs luggage, and by a small miracle, the third bag was circling alone on that carousel. 

We’re not leaving for another 4 days, and I’m already anxious about the return trip and luggage situations. I’m considering buying a duffel bag and shoving as much inside I can and carrying it on while leaving only my least favorite belongings in my luggage. We’ll see. I still have time to think on it. 

At least on the return, our vacation will be over and we have all of our things at home. Missing a few shorts and swim suits won’t be ruining if another mess up happens. 

This trip was a little impromptu to meet up and visit a son stationed in the military in Europe. If I had more time to plan and save, I’d make sure I flew with an airline that has at least HELPFUL customer service agents."
8.39095211029053,4.63087844848633,"Iberia Flight Delays",2,"Our family of four booked this June trip through Orbitz back in February, the first leg via TAP Portugal and the second through Iberia for Level Spain. The entire experience was problematic--booking through Orbitz and dealing with both of these airlines. This review deals with the return portion of our trip, and our booking experience with Orbitz.

First, on the return date of our trip, we got to the airport more than two hours early. We were flying first from Madrid to Barcelona (and the second leg was to San Francisco). We checked the information screen to see which desk number to check in for our flight and proceeded to tag our bags at the self-serve kiosk (since everyone in line had their tags). However, when we got to the portion where the tags were supposed to print, we were directed to a counter. After standing in line for about 15 minutes, we were told that for international flights, we wouldn't be able to do this. It would have been helpful to have signage or screen info to indicate this caveat. Also, despite what the info screens indicated, we should go stand in line at yet another desk to check in. So, we stood in line for about 30 minutes and when it was time to check in, we were told we needed to pay extra fees: 75€ per bag. We had four bags. After showing the agent the email from Orbitz that I obtained in February indicating there would be no fees for the first checked bag, she said she showed no bags had been paid for. Since two of our bags were carry-on size, she didn't charge for those, but did charge us 150€ for the two larger ones. By this time, we had been at the counter for about 30 minutes! Every step of check-in took several minutes. The agent kept consulting her partner at the next desk--she must have been new. It was a little after 7am when we arrived and we were hoping to have breakfast before our flight, but in the end, after 45 minutes at the check-in counter, we nearly missed our flight. They were already boarding when we arrived. Our family boarded the plane tired, hungry and frustrated. One more thing, since we got an error message online when trying to reserve our special meals, I had called Iberia to request them and was told we would have to request them at the check-in counter. Well, with all the other drama and delays, we forgot. Had we remembered, it probably would have taken more time than we had to get this agent to reserve them. So, we just ate snacks and expensive mediocre food during the longer 12-hour flight from Barcelona to San Francisco. To give you an idea of the pricing, water was 3€, snacks were anywhere from 5-7€ and coffee and tea were about 2.50€. Soda and juice were more expensive. Nothing was free--not even a cup of water. We spent about 100€ just to keep our family hydrated. We didn't purchase wi-fi, but that would have been over 20€ per person for the entire flight.That is probably par for the course for a low-cost airline, but I had no idea when I booked that this was the case. Once I saw that Iberia was running the long-haul flight, I somehow thought our experience on board would be better. Also, the flight back was freezing, more than most flights I have flown, but they sold blankets for 16€--just incredible...This, after making us wait in a sweltering stairwell  for 20 minutes, without fans or air conditioning, surrounded by frosted glass hit by the sun at a time when it was over 100 degrees F outside. I was starting to get dizzy and most passengers were sweating profusely by the time the buses came to take us to the plane to board.

We came into SFO on Saturday, June 29, around 6pm. After getting through customs, getting flagged to have our bags checked, most of the passengers had already retreived theres. We were told multiple times by SFO baggage claim staff that we should wait, that despite the screens indicating that all baggage had come through, that more bags were being brought out. So we waited, periodically checking with him, for about 20-30 minutes. After that, we went to the counter and stood in line to talk to an agent. The agent there traced all of our luggage to Madrid--it never left the airport after our lengthy and expensive check-in process. She said we would probably have them the following day, Sunday, June 30, because of other airlines with daily flights to SFO that Iberia could use to send them to us. She filed a Property Irregularity Report (PIR) and told me to call the number at the top for updates. We went home without any of our clothes, shoes, gifts or personal items, reassured that we would have them back the next day. I called the number on the PIR (for Iberia) on Monday. There was no updates.  I called Tuesday and the Iberia agent put in an urgent message to SFO for an update and said I should receive one on my phone. I did not. I called on the morning of Wednesday, July 3, and the Iberia agent I spoke to then sent a message to American Airlines, the carrier who brought the bags via Chicago to SFO. The only info I had at that point was that SFO was not confirming the arrival of the bags with Iberia, which meant that they couldn't be released to be delivered to us. So, I called SFO to see if there was someone I could talk to in the baggage claim area there. I spoke to two people, neither of which could give me a number of someone in the baggage claim area. So, I decided to wait and call later. Our bags were finally delivered that Wednesday evening. Although I am glad they weren't lost outright and it was a huge relief to get them back, it was a long and worrisome process that perhaps could have been avoided had we not had so much trouble at the initial check-in.

During this time, while trying to recover the bags, I was emailing Orbitz to get my 150€ in baggage fees refunded, as they assured me I would be able to if I simply provided the receipts, which I did. The first email I sent, they denied the refund. Then, I pressed, referencing the email in which the Orbitz agent confirmed that the first checked bag was included in the price of the ticket for each passenger. The emails came back with more requests, not acknowledging at all the fact that their own rep had assured me that this was not a charge I would have to pay. They tried to tell me that bags were not included and asked if I could provide a screenshot of the erroneous information. Who takes a screenshot of every page of a transaction online? I pushed back again and was provided with a phone number. After 45 minutes on the phone with both two reps and a supervisor--all of whom were polite, but tried to tell me I was NOT due a refund--I was finally refunded the fees. This is not what good customer service looks like, Orbitz. I share this story with everyone I know who travels. There is no way I would recommend Orbitz after this very frustrating experience! And the funny thing is, I usually book directly with the airlines if I can. This fare was so low, that I went through a third party to get it (and paid for it in other ways in the end)."

Furthermore they cancelled my connecting flight from Basel to Madrid on the return  flight but this flight was cancelled totally of their weekly flight schedule from Mondays to Sundays , no apologies or reason for this cancellation via the internet booking.

Iberia added some other quirks to annoy - having booked to premium long haul tickets I was surprised to find that on the Quito to Madrid leg, myself and my wife were given seats on opposite sides of the plane.
In Madrid, their handling of the final leg back to London was farcical. Our Boarding Passes (issued in Quito) said we would depart from Zone S which is near the Iberia Lounge in terminal 4S. They started displaying that the flight would leave from Zone H (which is in a different terminal!). When I asked at the desk how to get to Zone H they said no its leaving from S36. When I told them their displays were all wrong, they acknowledged it but didn't change it for 2 hours. Then they displayed S42 as we went to Board they changed it to S27. Terminal 4S in Madrid is very large so the distances between this different gates in not trivial when the flight is about to close.

Since I missed my first outbound flight of a multi leg international round trip flight for June 30, 2019 booked through Travelocity in May, Iberia canceled my ENTIRE itinerary, outbound AND return trip that I had bought for July 11. As a result I lost the entire value of my $3,597 flight itinerary. After over 10 hours of phone calls and 2 separate Iberia reps stating that at least my return flights were still valid, Iberia refused to work with me or my booking agency at all. So I had to book another, one way flight to get to Granada in time to give my paper at an international conference costing almost $7,000 for my and my 10 year old daughter's flights, only to be told once we arrived that Iberia would NOT reissue the original return flights and had erased it from their system. The Iberia phone rep in Spain said all they could do was to sell me a 3rd flight itinerary, one way to get home after my conference for another $8,124. Seriously. So an original round trip booking for 2 passengers I had paid $3,597 for, would end up costing $18,436. 
Thank goodness Travelocity finally stepped up and gave me a $1,000 refund on original itinerary and then booked a new round trip flight for $3671, which allowed me to cancel the $8124 itinerary they had booked me with a 24 hour """"free"""" cancelation policy that actually cost a 30 Euro transaction fee."

So We travel to Costa del Sol every year and we have flown on Iberia a few times but stopped because of their terrible service and customer interactions. Their planes are always very warm, the flight attendants are not very courteous, the level of food is abysmal and they are never on time. We have continuously had to run through the Madrid airport on our retinue to catch our connecting flight to Miami. So this time we decided to give them one last try as its easy to fly Delta form JFK to AGP. So we booked “their” First/business class two R/T tickets. Well the first problem is that when war arrived at our hotel in Costa Del Sol and opened our bags our wife’s bags were rummaged throughout. Someone was looking to steak valuables fortunately she had her jewelry on her person as we don’t place it the luggage. We filed a complaint through AMEX Centurion. So now we get to return flight so the return is delayed because of alleged air traffic hold which I subsequently checked and find out was a brief hold but not the one that Iberia placed our flight out of AGP on. This made us 1 hour late to Madrid. So with no time at all and even though I use a meet and greet service who was fantastic ( Diamond Air) we had to run through the Madrid airport grab a Train and try to make it across the entire airport in under 35 minutes.  I ended up tearing my left Achilles’ tendon ruining through the airport and sure enough none of our bags made it on our plane. I know because our Diamond Air agent went and checked and texted me that our bags did not make it. So we arrive at Miami International and immediately go to the information desk because Iberia if you can believe this does not even have a baggage claim person there. They Paige him and he is set up on garbage can with his laptop and a cell phone this was absurd and ridiculous. He then proceeds to tell us that one bag made it so we wait for 45 minutes and sure enough it nor any of our bags made it. So now we leave the airport as the baggage guy set up open the garbage can tells us that our bags are due to arrive on the next flight and be delivered to us the next day, and two days later we receive only 3 out of our 4 bags. So I try every which way to find a phone number to call the baggage division of Iberia but guess what they don’t have anyone that answers a phone its got to be the worse airline for a customer that I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED. They. Have lost a set of golf clubs valued at over $4,000. I cant talk to anyone so i have no idea where they are and we are leaving again next to travel. This company is to be avoided at all costs, I have complained to AMEX Centurion and will undoubtedly have to file a claim through Centurion for payment of the lost baggage.

Iberia lost my bag 12 days ago on a direct flight from Milano to Madrid. It not only ruined my stay in Madrid (which was only for 3 days) but I flew back to Miami and I still don't know where my bag is. A couple of days later in Miami, I receive an email from Aviapartner in Milano saying they found the bag and that they were going to send it in the next available flight. Up until this point, Iberia still did not know anything about my bag. Aviaparter confirmed the bag was sent to Miami on a BA flight. Iberia then found out it was going in this flight but they could not confirm or track the bag because it was not their airline. After waiting for 24 hours of its """"arrival"""" in Miami and many customer service calls in which they could not provide the location of the bag, they confirmed the bag did not go in BA flight but in an Airitaly flight that left the following day. The events repeated: I had to call customer service again and they were not able to confirm if the bag was sent or not. The customer service line was useless: it takes a lot of time to finally get to speak to a representative because it seems they want to get customer frustrated and end the call. A computer asks for the claim number which you have to repeat for about 4 to 5 times because the computer will always get a number or letter wrong.  Finally, when they decide to put you through to speak with a representative the person rushes through the call, cannot answer the questions you have and leaves you exactly at the same place you started when the call was dialed.  
Anyway, I went to the Miami International Airport to look for the bag that was coming in this Airitaly flight and for the second time in a week the bag did not make it to Miami. I called Iberia customer service again and the response was: """"we don't know where the bag is, we don't have access to Airitaly you are going to have to wait. If the airport does not find it was probably lost"""". How can an airline lose a bag two times on the same trip??! The customer service lady ended the call saying: """"well these things can happen, do you have any other question?"""" 
Round three: The weekend goes by and I give the customer service another call. Now they confirmed the bag is going on a BA flight. Same story: BA cannot provide me information because the claim number corresponds to Iberia. Iberia, on the other hand, does not know where the bag is because they can access BA information. Aviaparter in Milano is now not responding to my emails and calls! Its day 13 since I last saw my bag and I have no idea where it is. I've lost a ton of time every single day on this issue because I need to get it back. I have valuable things in and medicines in the bad which I need to recuperate.

Also, we had a 2 hour window between our connecting flight and I was worried that if we were delayed too much leaving Chicago we might miss our connection in Madrid going to Geneva. However, we got in on time and everything went smoothly. The plane and flight crew were fine. The business class seats were good, not quite as comfortable as American Airlines business class lie-flat seats. However, I was still able to sleep about 6 hours since it was an overnight flight. I can't comment about the meal that was served for dinner because I was sleeping. The breakfast was nothing special. We also flew business class to and from Geneva and the planes were fine and the meals were actually very good. As for the in-flight entertainment system on the long haul flight I don't know if they offered any movies in English unless they were subtitled. So if it was a flight that I was awake not having movies in English would have been an issue. Not sure if I would choose to fly Iberia again unless I had to, but it was fine.

Each seat came with your own entertainment system i.e. games, movies, tv shows. A lot of the movies were pretty new as I watched Captain Marvel which only came out a few weeks ago.

I then when through almost the entire booking process online myself and, short of paying for the flight myself, I showed them it was available. They then said they could change my booking for me twice. This sounded like complete lies but I gave up trying to get sense out of the ticketing team after a while.

First: as mentioned, we paid the premium to choose seats. However the equipment was changed so we wound up in a 4 seater instead of the 2 seated we had purchased. I believe we are owed a refund.
Second: your staff at JFK was speaking only Spanish, and thus several passengers had problems understanding what was being announced. The concept of 6 groups to board the plane will not work if all the people do not understand what is being requested of us. The local signage that was employed to identify the queues was a disgrace. It looked like someone’s dog had eaten it before it was deployed. Contrast this to Madrid, where the signage was quite elaborate. The staff there made every effort to be bi-lingual.
Third: the ability to check-in through an Android phone offered was not working. When asked the country of origin my option was not US, or USA, but USES. The system on multiple attempts gave me erratic choices at each attempt. In any case we were not able to check-in in advance.

As we were only staying in Madrid for one night we only needed to check one case and thought nothing more of it. We booked seats with extra room for the return flight to give us a little more comfort. On check in for our return flight back to Düsseldorf we were told that we would have to pay for our baggage and forced to pay €25.00 (after lots of discussions) for the privelege of being able to take our case back home with us. As I was on business and we experienced no financial hardship it wasnt really that much of a problem, however Iberia's immoral business practice in putting their passengers in such a position is a problem and one that I throroughly disagree with.

For this second leg, Iberian offered an irresistible deal. To upgrade our tickets to business class cost only thirty-something Euros. Even if it contradicts to our principles paying business class for such a short trip, it would have been a sin for this money to omit the offer.
Good old Iberian provided us with everything that we expected. That I would bring up against them, that the rubbish of the previous passenger was in the pocket of the back of the seat in front of me. When I mentioned it to the stewardess, she immediately removed it and apologized. Obviously, it wasn't her fault; only the cleaning staff made a lazy job. 
The seats were as they usually are on small airplanes. Three seats were for two passengers, one in the middle. Of course, they don't provide such a luxury as the Airbus A380, or  Boeing 777-300ER does, but the price of them also just a fracture of the ones mentioned above.

We booked flights from London to South America, via Madrid and Sao Paulo. Our flight was meant to land in Brazil at 5.45am for an 8.25 connection. Maybe we should have thought it strange that staff in London and Madrid were unable to give us boarding cards for our final flight, but no one mentioned any problems. When we landed and disembarked around 6.15am, we were told that our connecting flight had already departed – 3 hours early. No one was able to explain why and we were forced to spend 24hours in Sao Paulo, therefore missing an important family event. I was prepared to forgive that – these things happen, I guess.
My real problems started when I tried to contact Iberia to complain about the 24 hour delay. This is the experience –

1.	Iberia have an online complaint form which doesn’t work. It takes 20 minutes to complete then crashes, flashing up a ‘technical error’ message. We tried this 4 times using phones, tablets, laptops and different browsers. Conclusion – its set up to crash so you can’t file a complaint.

2.	There is no email contact for complaints on the website. There is a customer service phone number, but this is for sales customer service. They won’t help with general complaints and claim not to have access to the complaints system. They also won’t provide an email or contact number. They did however give me a postal address in Madrid. I asked what I would need to do if I received no response to my letter and was told there is no way to follow it up. Write another letter. Then another. Then another. That’s just how it is, was what the girl told me.

3.	Iberia try to direct you to twitter. Obviously run by an agency, this is just a gatekeeper. They won’t discuss specifics or provide any contact details. They asked me to send them a DM showing the on screen message I was getting when trying to submit the complaint form. To do that they need to follow me, as they well know. But they wouldn’t. So I couldn’t send a DM. Very clever!

4.	I finally managed to use a variation of the complaint form (right at the bottom of the drop down list -other, try it if you get desperate!). I received a reply after a week which said –‘Our flight schedules are altered every time the season changes and also during certain holiday periods according to demand and the availability of take-off and landing slots at airports. Whenever this situation arises, as in your case, the changes are announced through the ticket purchase point’. 
i.e a total non -response! What does that even mean? That they can cancel flights whenever they want with impunity?? 

5. Here’s the real kicker – Most airlines are part of ADR schemes – this is an independent body who allow you to log complaints and act as a mediator in disputes. Guess what? Iberia have opted out. They aren’t a member of any scheme, so are effectively beyond the law. As far as I can tell, there is no way of holding them to account.

I left my jacket on the plane and all customer service agents were friendly and I did get my jacket back. Return flight, same experience.

My only complaint is that once you select your seats (I booked through American), you can't go back and double check what you selected or make sure that they aren't changed without your knowledge.

We were flying from Vienna to Boston via Madrid more than 3 days ago and my suitcase completely vanished. I have not heard any news about my suitcase for more than 80 hours now... They do not pick up the phone, do not answer our emails, do not provide any information whatsoever. We managed to reach them once via phone but we have been trying to call them for 3 days now, we are spending a lot of time and money on phone calls, but cannot even get to a real person. I am attending a business conference which ends tomorrow. All of my clothes, high heels, jewelry, beauty products, makeup, perfume, toiletries, electronic devices, business materials, shoes, jackets, expensive elegant dresses went missing. I have to go through all of my meetings without being able to present my business cards... Some meetings and receptions I was not even able to attend because I had to spend my time with trying to call Iberia and then trying to find an elegant dress that I can buy. Of course, it is completely impossible to buy fitting shoes, perfume, purse, elegant dresses, jacket, makeup, toiletries and everything you need for a business trip in few hours, and also, I cannot afford to buy all of these at once. Also, as I mentioned before, I do not even have the time to run around for clothes when I am supposed to be in meetings that actually matter. This conference only happens once a year.
DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT FLY WIHT Iberia IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR BELONGINGS, THEY STEAL ALL OF YOUR STUFF! Or just let it disappear and then do not care about you at all. I think in these situations I should be provided a personal contact who could update me about the location of my bag every 4 hours or so. Or I would at least have someone who knows my situation and whom I can reach.
It all started with a technical problem in Vienna, they had all of their computers down, there was an exceedingly long queque to checkin, the plane we had hand-written boarding passes. This company is a pathetic joke. 
Also, the flight from Vienna to Madrid was extremelly uncomfortable, seats cannot be reclined, there is no space for your legs at all, there is no food in the service, etc.

On flight, they seated my husband and I by the exit doors without even asking us if that was okay with us. And mind you, we were not seated together. The stewardess was so rude.

Sadly I never experienced one in all my travels until flying with this airline. I’m truly appalled at how horrible their customer service is and they are very determined to not give customers clear answers and information about anything. I went to Spain the 3rd week of March 2019 and our luggage somehow got lost. When I went to the Iberia customer service counter they basically told me to give them the address to the hotel I’d be at in Barcelona, the address to the hotel I’d be at in Madrid and my home address.

I continued my trip to Barcelona where we were spending 3 days and had to buy all new clothes, shoes and toiletries which between my friend and I was about $400 bucks.

It was not clearly explained that this flight was to be on Level, which meant you get an 8 1/2 hour flight that offers NOTHING!  We knew checked bags cost extra, but we had carryons.  What we didn’t know was that they torture people with carryons, trying to force them to pay high checked bag fees by limiting weight of carryons to 10 kilos.  
Your suitcase probably weighs 5 kilos empty, which leaves you very little to fill it. 
Then your suitcase has to fit through a tiny carryon slot, not just fit in the carryon rectangle. I helped about 5 people in front of me force theirs through.  Pissing off the check in counter folks no doubt. The check in lines were slowed by group after group having to open their suitcases to move stuff around or wear it.  It is more than annoying.  But this was only the first headache.  
The terminal and gate printed on the boarding pass given to us after the bag ordeal, was not actually correct, but there was no announcement to that effect, and no change on the airport departure board.  
Quite simply, no one knew where to go, and I saw elderly people with ambulation problems walking all over, exhausted and complaining.   We kept asking people where to go and were directed to different locations.  Then I get a text that my 71 year old wife has been selected for an extra intense security check.  I figure that’s because they were pissed off that I helped five people squeeze their bags through the slot.  
The text said to report to the boarding gate 1 1/2 hours early for this check, but that was impossible because the gate wasn’t determined yet!!!!   An airline cannot be more disorganized!   But wait... it gets worse!  Finally the gate is posted, and my wife goes for the security check, but they can’t do it because I’m not with her. Of course, that’s not what the text said.  So she has to go back and get me.  Finally the check is over, and we are allowed to board. 
But boarding is not at the gate!!!  We have to walk downstairs to a bus to be driven to a jumbo jet on the tarmac.   There are about 50 steps up to the plane.  I can’t imagine how those people with mobility problems got up there with their carryons. 
I carried my wife’s and mine.  
With all this disorganization, one had to wonder if this airline is safe. 
Finally we take off.  We had no idea that the flight would offer NOTHING on board. You paid for a cup of water!  They didn’t even ask if you wanted to buy something, you had to call them.  We spent 21 Euros for two miniscule somethings and two small drinks.  Had we known, or if Expedia explained, we would have bought something to eat and drink at the airport. 
The only reasonable thing was that the flight was on time, the landing was soft, and the seats no worse than other airlines.

They have me a phone number to contact their office at the airport, and I tried calling that number at least 50+ times over 4 days with no answer what so ever.  I called their main corporate offices, again with no answer.  I tried connecting through the Milan airport's main number, again with no answer.  We ultimately decided just to drive to the airport to see if our bags had arrived after receiving an automated email that they were supposed to have been flown in a couple of days ago.  Fortunately our bags were there, but it was incredibly frustrating and ruined the beginning of our trip.  I don't fault them for losing the luggage which happens, but they need to have some sort of communication with their customers.  For me not to be able to contact anyone at the airline for days and having to drive to the airport for an answer is ridiculous and unacceptable.  I don't understand why they even list a phone number that nobody answers.  Even if I got free tickets on this airline, I still wouldn't fly with them.  If you run across any luggage problems, you will not be able to get a hold on anyone."

As we travelled on hand luggage we arrived at the airport and went straight through security to the departures area. The incoming flight from Madrid was delayed by approx. 1 hour, which isn't much in the grand scheme of flying. Boarding was called however this was incredibly chaotic. They tried to board by group number. I was seated at the back of the aircraft but was in the last group number and one of the last to board the plane, meaning we were even more delayed as people were still in the aisles and overhead lockers - common sense would think that being boarded by a jetway, the back of the plane are first on board? This was really disorganised. 
We were stopped by an abrupt and downright rude woman at the gate who demanded my friend check in her hand luggage (mine was fine) as a lot of customers were connecting in Madrid and we were ending our journey here. The reason seemed ok and fair enough, although her manner was disgusting. When boarding the aircraft however, I noticed coats and rucksacks in the overhead lockers and not under the seat in front which annoyed me further. Other airlines (like TAP, Jet2 and BA) tag these bags and FA's will remove from the overhead lockers to make space. There was room, just again common sense did not prevail and other passengers were not told to put certain items under their seats, which would have freed up space.
Seat comfort - terrible. I'm 6'1 and thankfully this was a short 45 minute flight, as my knees dug into the hard plastic of the seat in front. I think I've had more legroom on Ryanair. 
Couldn't comment on food and drink and IFE as there was none, such a short flight. Aircraft was clean, that was the only positive, but i think that's only because its such a short flight OPO-MAD and no snacks / food / drinks were served, a longer flight may have been different.

I have mostly used Delta, but after their point redemption hikes it has become less affordable to fly business. I use AMEX points to transfer to airlines and after seeing a bonus for Iberia I decided to check them out. I had enough points for 4 business class seats, so I booked two trips - one in April and one in August. I did this even after reading the many bad reviews of Iberia. I have read that the crew in both economy and business are very rude and inattentive. I have also read that the food is horrible and the whole experience is lacking, but I figured that as long as I got to where I was going I didn't care. I was expecting the worse.

The only issue was not realizing that we had to check in with the gate before boarding the plane. Also, when the called for the boarding of the plane they made the announcement in Spanish and asked for Priority first, but this was not  understood and everyone rushed the gate. I thought this was the beginning of the horror, but the gate agents were turning back those not in Priority, and our need to check in with the gate was not much of an issue.

Once we were on the plane we were treated as well as other business class flights. We were served a drink and able to relax. The head flight attendant spoke with each customer and explained everything in the business class seat and also provided the menu. She was pleasant and took her time with everyone. After hearing the bad reviews about customer service I was surprised to have such an attentive person.

I had no plans on eating dinner since I heard that they took a long time to serve dinner and that the food was horrible.  I was surprised again that once we got to the point where the seat belt sign was off they began meal service. Within 30 minutes were just about finished with dinner. The food was not horrible. I never think airline food, whether economy or business is fantastic. I would say the food was on par with most flights. It was better than my expectation. 

As for the seats, they are pretty typical for business. But for some reason, I found them to be a bit better than other business flights I have been on. Not sure why, but it was a comfortable flight.

5.87720203399658,6.43460512161255,"Iberia Passenger Service",5,"I write this letter after I experienced an incredible service experience in my last flight from Madrid to Tel Aviv As a journalist and as a strategic and media consultant to The President of Israel, four deputy prime ministers, and the former spokesman for the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee and the Airports Authority spokesman, you can imagine I flew a lot with many different airlines to various destinations around the world.
But this flight with Iberia from Madrid to Tel Aviv was an exceptional one.
This flight was unique not just because of the 320-300, airbus aircraft' the awesome dinner and the efficiency of boarding. But mainly because of the staff, especially the Mrs Susana Mauri Lopez - I find it essential to write to you about this air stewardess because her conduct reflects the spirit of your flying companies, a conduct which showcases the service and brings honor and pride to the airline. Mrs. Lopez is a lighthouse when it comes to Providing service, professionalism and efficiency.
But beyond that, Mrs. Lopez. Has been blesses with notable features of human love, Ability to contain and Emotional intelligence that turns the aircraft into a pleasant enjoyment.
Luckily, I was sitting in seat 21. J near the central kitchen and could observe the work, courtesy of passengers including """"not easy"""" passengers with strange demands and requests.
Mrs. Lopez immediately helped in solving all problems, with much understanding and tolerance.
The conduct of Mrs. Lopez Was not only regarding the passengers but also concerning her colleagues - Her collaboration with the whole team caused a sensation of comfort and efficiency to the whole work processes.
As someone who was the Israeli Airports Authority spokesman (including the BG airport), I'm well aware of the of the crew' but Mrs. Lopez takes he job a step forward – not just """"doing her job"""" - but seeing for the needs of every traveler, including listening and containing.
Fortunately, in the short time that Mrs. Lopez Wasn't busy,  I had a chance to discuss a variety of topics and exciting horizons extenders that brought to light a bit of Mrs. Lopez's extensive education, vision and highlighted her Barcelonan environment in which she grew up and was educated.
Needless to say, that a person that his job is giving services, such as a flight attendant, expanding the fields of human touch, intelligence, beyond the areas on which it is deposited, makes the flight experience itself  intensified, and in this case of  the extraordinary flight more invaluably from any of various movies in the multimedia system.
As someone who was a journalist and, and  today, as Ombudsman, and in charge of freedom of information, I'm well aware of the difficulty in facing the """"Israeli"""" customer conduct, especially at the end of the holiday season, especially regarding the collection of bags from the overhead compartments in the end of flights.
 In a world where we all often post complaints, bashing in the social media I find it essential to praise and compliment about my personal good experiences. 
I'll be happy if you'll transfer the contents of the letters to the ceo, VP human resources miz    Julia Simpson   and of course Mrs. Lopez That brought a lot of respect for your airline"

Finally got to Barcelona (now almost 2 days late) only to find out they have no idea where her luggage is- nothing like being in your clothes for two days and nothing to change into.

Upon arrival at the gate we were told we missed the flight and told it was not the fault of Iberia, but of the airport.  Further told that this happens “all the time” because all domestic flights leave almost simultaneously.  There were 8 connecting passengers besides us that had this happen. We were told we should complain to the airport authority!  So happens all the time and Iberia does not reschedule knowing this because it is not their fault?  No guarantee of seats on the next connecting flight because it was our responsibility to get to the gate on time!

We booked Iberia flights from Tel-Aviv to Cancun (via Madrid and Mexico City) and back. All the flights had Iberia code but the last lag was operated by Interjet.
On our return, Interjet had a delay in the flight from Cancun to Mexico City. Due to this delay we missed our flight from Mexico to Madrid. But Iberia had a later flight (which we arrived 3 hours before it's departure) that we could have taken and still make to our original flight from Madrid to Tel-Aviv. Iberia, together with Interjet decided, for their own reasons, to send other passengers and gave us tickets only for the Madrid flight for the next day. We tried to argue with them that they will give us also tickets for the flight to Tel-Aviv but they insisted it's impossible and said that we'll get the these tickets tomorrow.
The next day we came to the airport and found out that we can't take the flight since there are no places in the ongoing flight to Tel-Aviv!!!
They rolled the responsibility back to Interjet and didn’t try to give us any service. They completely disavowed us!!!
They knew all the time that we could have make it to our original flight but choose to disregard this. Further than that, they knew that we won’t have places for the flight the next day to Tel-Aviv and fooled us by giving us tickets only to Madrid knowing that they won't let us board this flight. They knew all along that they will keep us waiting for 48 hours and they didn’t even care!!! They lied to us all that time.

Customer service, that's what they call it, but in reality it is a customer irritation, after an elaborate exchange indicated ann Iberia website where you can select a shop where you can exchange the damaged luggage for an identical new one. The problem was that in my town there was no such Iberia authorised shop. The nearest is 100 km away. So the solution is that you send your claim, passport copy, invoice copies of purchase etc etc etc to a PO Box in Madrid. I have done so, but no acknowledgement, no reply, no refund. I went to Iberia Messenger account and explained the problem. No solution offered, just an indication to go another website, then the same website I had already used to send the documents to Madrid, in short customer service consists of doing nothing, gives no answers, does not help and just lets you run around from one concrete unresponding wall to the next.

I have been a Platinum and Gold member with Iberia for many years and for those of you considering flying them, I suggest you consider the following issues:
1.  Service on board is average to below average as compared to other airlines, and this is true regardless whether you fly Business, Premium Economy or Economy.  
2. Long haul flights are particularly harsh for those of us who remain awake for most of the flight.  You hardly ever see any crew checking on the passengers.  After the rushed meal service, they evaporate and literally disappear.  There are few exceptions but are rare.
3.  If you are an inexperienced traveler, you're in trouble.  They will literally ignore you and any requests will be looked upon without any grace.
4.  I have been recently taking non-stop flights on American, Delta, Air Europa, BA, and Norwegian and their service and attitude are superior than what you find with Iberia.
5.  They still have more direct flights to many Central and South American cities but competition is catching up to them.

April 9,2019: Iberia London -->Madrid-->Lisbon Missed connection in Madrid due to late start out of Heathrow by the airline. We were originally supposed to hop on a 7:35 PM from Madrid to Lisbon, but got put on a 10:30 PM flight that was also delayed to 11:05 PM on the departure screen at the Madrid airport.
We asked to fly the next morning as we had already been traveling a full 27 hours from Denver, and they said we would have to pay a full fare and lose the money we already paid for the flight that was super late, so we waited for a flight we know was delayed until 11:05 PM and boarded at 11:15 PM.  
Once on the plane, we were late due an additional 90 minutes due to a computer chip needing to be replaced. 
After 90 minutes, they disembarked us and we had to walk a long way to the new gate (J56-H18) which I estimate to be about a mile. It took an additional 90 minutes to get us on the plane that had one less row than the other plane (from row 32 to row 31 in new plane). People were displaced and standing while the airplane was taxiing! How unsafe!! 
There was some kind of electrical issues with the blue lights on the passenger seats. They were blinking on and off for the duration of the flight.
While we were detained in Madrid and so much time had passed, our accommodation had closed leaving us with nowhere to stay and the Lisbon airport closes at 00 (midnight) so we were worried about getting to Lisbon and not finding a taxi or Uber and having nowhere to sleep so I asked a flight attendant (Elizabeth Suza) if she could help us understand what to do when we got to Lisbon. Her response: I have to board this plane, I don’t have time to talk to you”, I replied, “can you direct me who to talk with either here in Madrid or when we get to Lisbon? We are nervous and don’t know the language and we need to know that we can have somewhere to sleep when we get there. Who can we talk to?” She replied, “no one. There is no one to talk to”.
This raised my temperature a lot because we were being herded like cattle and treated like we were the ones inconveniencing Iberia and were too needy. I called Iberia customer support on my cell phone at around 00:06 (12:06 PM) and Laura told me that there is nothing they will do to help us and to talk to someone at the airport about it, which was impossible since we were the only people there at that hour and I had already asked an Iberia representative who told me she would do nothing.
On this new plane, our cellphones are both out of juice and we won't have a way to make any calls when we getting Lisbon - there are no power options on the plane. This is all so many events and along the way, we just needed assurance that when we got to Lisbon, we wouldn’t be stranded, but the face of Iberia customer support is just awful and void of any compassion- even when we clearly ask for help.

I tried to do that of course, however I have never seen a more scummy website in my entire life. If you are trying to navigate your way to this elusive baggage delay claim form you only find parts of their website no longer in use and ways to compliment their service.

I had taken hand luggage of the right weight and measurements to qualify as hand baggage only & yet my small case was removed by a member of Air Iberia staff without allowing me to comment. As I was transferring to a BA flight at Madrid I had to retrieve my luggage and go through security again, which meant that it all took considerably longer than I'd anticipated - it was very fortunate that I hadn't booked on the earlier flight to London as I would definitely have missed it. Coupled with the misinformation Madrid Airport staff gave me about the gate number for my flight to London I ended up fearing I would miss my flight. Whilst queuing to board the BA flight to London a polite member of BA staff came round and asked passengers if they would be prepared to put their hand luggage in the hold as the flight was full. I said no, because I'd already had to do this once and it had delayed me considerably. 

A little later a member of Air Iberia ground staff came down the queue and just told various people including me that their cases would have to go in the hold. When I got onto the aircraft I saw many people with exactly the same size luggage and in some cases bigger on the aircraft. 

In summary, the ground staff at Santander were discourteous & gave no consideration to someone like me who was going to transfer flights at Madrid and so would be pushed for time and the Iberia ground staff at Madrid were equally rude and unhelpful. If I had the choice, I'd never use them again."

Two hours they made an annoucement that the plane was hard broke and they could not get the replacement until the next day - flight was cancelled.  We were told that htey would put us in hotels for the night.  Atter standing in line for 7, yes 7 hours we were told that they could not find enogh rooms for the 300+ passengers.  We were given a letter that said if we could find our own rooms they would reimburse us up to 100 euros.  All we had to do was simply email the company IN SPAIN and they would magically refund our money (yeah right!).  Also since our flight was delayed overnight we could file for compensation AGAIN FROM THE AIRLINE IN SPAIN.  Of course, I filed for reimbursement for the hotel and delay and I was told that that I was doing it wrong and that you play Sherlock Holmes and try to figure out how to file a complaint on their website - not an easy task.

I called because my new flight added more than 6 hrs to my travel time and my canceled flight was direct. But of course there’s a long wait, everyone on my canceled flight was probably calling Iberia. My rescheduled flight would depart the next morning and I’d need to return to the airport in a few hours, so I decided to just go to bed and take the new flight hoping I could call Iberia from Spain and change my return flight. Nope! Iberia revoked my option to make changes to my itinerary because I had accepted the outgoing flight. I’d have to pay $275 euro just to change my flight. In the end, Iberia offered nothing as a courtesy for my having lost a day in Spain, added travel time, no reimbursement for my Lyft ride home home and back to the airport and nothing for my preset travel plans in Spain that were compromised as a result of all this. I will never fly Iberia again."

I called Iberia at least 10 times within a 1month period trying to resolve this. Each time I called they said I need to call back when an English-speaking manager is there, or they promised they would call me after they review my case. To make a long story short, in the end
Iberia told me that my claim was false, would not let me see a transcript of the original call, made no apologies and said there’s nothing more they can do. I then asked him if the records show what date my call was listened to by the manager and when this judgment was made. He said TODAY. Though I’ve been calling Iberia about this for a month, no one dealt with my case until today, after all their promises of someone getting back to me weeks ago. Their customer service is a joke.

The only two staffs at the checking struggled to check-in everyone and there was still a long queue when it was time to board. The fact that one of the two staffs had to leave to go and do the boarding didn't help the matter. At the end about 30-40 passengers were denied boarding as the flight had to leave. This was already quite poor from Iberia, but that's how they handled this situation after that made me swear to myself I will never fly with them again.
They left us 6 hours in the terminal without any information and the staff were actually quite rude with an attitude of """"well that's how it is"""". A bit before midnight, they told us they will transport us to an hotel and re-book us on other flights. The hotel was 1hr away. I actually live much closer but they told us if we go home they won't contact us with the new flight details. We arrived at the hotel around 1am, and they woke us up at 5am telling us we had to go back to the airport to take our flights. I can even imagine how hard it must have been for the ones with young childrens.
Once at the airport they gave everyone their new flight details and ours were only the day after !
We were treated like cattle, lost two days of holidays and on top of that they refused to pay us any compensation. Claiming compensation through third party company didn’t help either as the original flight (for those who managed to get on it) did arrive on time.

Never seen that on a plane before so if on this flight NEVER SIT IN ROW 60. The crew even used the loo and left the door open afterwards so light on....it was a night flight leaving at 11.45pm.  Then a steward went in and was banging at the sink, left the door open so all around were woken up. Crew were in and out of their locker above my head, no chance of sleeping. There was a meal an hour into the flight which was disgusting and then nothing. If you wanted a drink you went to the galley and crew pointed at the water for you to help yourself. No drinks offered to you. Don’t know where crew went, the one in the galley was reading the paper and there seemed to be a lot of what I class as ‘bed hair’ when you eventually saw crew dishing out ‘breakfast’ over 11 hours into the flight.

First of all, after paying 700 Euro for a flight, I couldn't check in. I was given a random seat without being able to change it. I had to sit in the middle for one of the flights even though I stayed up all night waiting to check in as early as possible. The flight was late because the organisation was horrible. Before the boarding, they asked almost half of the passengers to go to the desk one by one.. Something that only Iberia does! Before our flight, an extremely rude lady yelling at everyone was taking our hand luggage to be put as hold luggage because there were no space even though not even half of the people could put their hand luggage on the plane. Well, maybe all the crew were carrying 1 million suitcases so there was no space for us. Then Iberia being Iberia started selling food instead of giving food as a normal airline and not a low-cost airline. I guess they are a low-cost airline not different from Ryanair or Wizzair or LEVEL (except that the prices are much higher!). And after my complaint, they just said they hoped I had a great flight.

Our baggage -- there were 3 of us, including my wife and my son -- didn't arrive in Tenerife; it was delayed by 24 hours.  Unlike other airlines, which at least have the courtesy of delivering the luggage to one's hotel or wherever one is staying, the airline requires you to come back to the airport to pick up your luggage.  If you're on vacation, you can waste a few hours doing all this.  On the way back to LA, the connection time is 1 hour in Madrid, and they assured me that would be sufficient and that their flight from Tenerife is always on time.  It left 30 minutes late and I had to run for 25 minutes at the terminal to catch the connection.  Once again, the luggage in LA did not arrive.  But what is worse is the cheek and arrogance of this airline.  As our luggage didn't arrive in Tenerife, and it was a bit cold and we had no spare clothes, the three of us had to buy clothing and we spent 200 Euros.  When I filed a complaint, after a huge number of hassles, their office in New York after various email exchanges and me having to send all kinds of documentation promised to reimburse us 50 Euros, to which of course I objected in the strongest terms as an insulting and wholly inadequate offer.

On the Heathrow to Madrid leg: there was no air conditioning. Like at all. Apparently this happens frequently. I had to strip my infant down to just his diaper since we was sweating profusely. 

Madrid to JFK: They changed the plane out at the last minute so it means that me (and other passengers) who had paid to pick there seats or even pay for business class was just thrown around a plane at random. Still traveling with an infant, I was put far away from my husband, and not in the seat that I had paid for specifically to have a baby cot. I took this as an inconvenience and attempted to move past it. When we arrived in JFK I had discovered they had lost my infants car seat. Still unsure where it is, and neither do they. Car seats are not cheap! We went to the baggage area to file our claim and figure our how to move forward. This is where the fun begins. The RUDE man sitting behind the counter carried on his conversation with his friend until he acknowledged us. He then acted like we were inconveniencing HIM by even having a problem. He rolled his eyes a few times, and banged on his computer as if to pretend he was working hard to find it. I wish I was exaggerating. He then told me they forgot to put in the plane. I was given a claim and a tracking number, and was dismissed. Obviously, I cannot leave the airport with out a car seat since that would be ILLEGAL. I asked if they did, and he proceeded to go into the back room. He came back and said they don't, and that there was nothing they could do. I asked for a manager, and he said I can walk to find one. NO. I SHOULD NOT BE THE ONE TO FIND A MANAGER, YOU SHOULD HAVE FOUND ONE. Now he is even more inconvenienced. 

Graciously, Alaska airways (counter next to him), brought us a brand new car seat out of a box and offered it to us. We were releived. British Airways (who is Iberia's partner) was next to them, and after a manager finally got involved, gave us one of theirs. 

*side note: the Alaska Airlines car seat was a bit to small for him due to his weight, but we woukd have totally dealt with that*

British Airways showed us there plethora of car seats in the same room where this Iberia airlines man said there was none. We also asked him why he couldn't ask his partner airline to use one of theirs. His response was """"well you can"""" with another eye roll. The Iberia manager gave us one of the BA car seats and said that it was not a common practice. BA also explicitly said, in front of Iberia management and all, that they had """"never heard of an airline not having back up car seats for when something like this happens."""" 

In conclusion (I apologize for the length), Iberia's lack of general customer service was scathing. If I could give this airline no stars, I would. Spend the extra few dollars and fly someone reputable. To this day, my car seat is nowhere to be found and no one will answer the phone."

But if you're looking into an airline expecting some level of customer service, then don't bother. One red flag for us was that it was hard to find out what our flight included (i.e. refreshments, meals), we had been checking on the website with our booking info, but was unable to check any of that even until the day of the flight. And turns out that several others had the same problem and asked the flight attendants, but depending on who you asked, either they themselves didn't know the answer either, or said that you had to take an extra step when you booked your flights to purchase any refreshments or meals-- and a lot of us don't even remember seeing this option. My ticket didn't include meals, so I ended up ordering some food, and the attendant said he'd be back in 15 min after it warms up. I normally don't like to be pushy, so I waited for 15 min and gave it another 10 before calling again to check the status of my meal. A different attendant came and before I even spoke, she rudely said, """"your food is warming up, it takes 20 minutes, so be patient,"""" and just left. As soon as she left, another attendant came and tossed my food where my tray is without saying anything. It was definitely not the nicest experience I've had flying compared to any other airline. 
Also, in the middle of the flight at one point, the airline made an announcement saying that they don't want to answer any more call lights, and if passengers needed anything, they are to physically go find a cabin staff to make your requests. Kind of absurd if you ask me.... Overall, would try to avoid flying this airline unless I was desperate."

Meanwhile we insisted our bags be sent to Madrid to join us on the next flight to Havana which the airline staff assured us this is done we were told to book our own hotel in Madrid by the gate staff which is a lie. We booked our own hotel but when we arrive in Madrid past midnight we had no luggage not even hand luggage. We had to pay for the hotel we did not use. We flew to Havana the next date and got into the cruise ship with 5 minutes to spare and No Luggage. For future travellers PLEASE DO NOT CHECK IN YOUR HAND LUGGAGE INSIST THAT THERE IS VITAL MEDICATION IN THE HAND LUGGAGE and you have to carry it with you. Throughout the entire 2 weeks cruise we survive on the minimum clothes 1 t shirt provided by the cruise ship and a set of underwear, Not able to buy any clothes onboard or in Havana ....sizes too big.We are home 5 days now days still no luggage.tried calling Iberia daily but no answer.  When will we get our luggage back? If you ask for compensation form everything is done online. Thank you Iberia/BA for ruining our entire cruise we looked forward to it for almost 1 year. You should call yourself Low Cost Spanish (not British) airline. Shame on you 👎👎👎👎👎"

In general I have found that when things go smoothly staff are polite and helpful. When things so wrong ,which they often do,staff become totally unprofessional barking and snapping at clients who dare to ask for information.
On flying to Madrid for a connecting flight in Dec. from Heathrow, at the very last moment as passengers were queuing to board ,the flight was suddenly cancelled. Utter chaos  resulted  as Iberia staff were totally ill equipped to organise alternative flights for everyone including those like us who had connecting flights.
On return this week the wrong terminal was on the flight board at Madrid , resulting in several people waiting at the wrong terminal and gate, An employee turned up and was frantically typing on the computer.She was very aggressive to a few who dared to ask what was happening.Eventually we were taken on a long bus ride to the correct terminal and gate to the awaiting plane now nearly full. After a 3 month stay in Uruguay our handluggage contained items too essential or of value e.g. documents, medicines, jewellery and expensive equipment to go in the hold.It was extremely stressful having to persuade an employee and then cabin staff of this, who were insisting there was no room.Eventually adequate room was found on board. We had the same thing happen last year.On reading of loss and theft of hand luggage which is refused at the last minute to go on board, I am glad that we refused to allow this. Both times this happened to us there was in fact room on board.After a long overnight flight this was extremely stressful and indeed left me in tears.
I conclude that Iberia is very """"hit and miss"""" and staff seem totally untrained to treat clients appropriately.
All attempts to contact Iberia by phone yesterday were unsuccessful."

I was unfamiliar with Iberia, but trusted that it must be quality, being part of the One World Alliance, boy was I wrong!  I am an avid international traveler with several long haul flights under my belt and Priority status with American, and I have to say this Iberia plane and its crew were the least impressive I’ve encountered.  We had an A330 outbound and return; I enjoyed the economy seating configuration of 2-aisle-4-aisle-2 seating, so my friend and I had our own space near a window, but the seats were thin and not very comfortable. The outbound crew was extremely stiff and unfriendly. The movie selections were fine, the meals provided were filling and flavorful.  I previously flew to Barcelona on an American Airlines plane, so I don’t know why I was placed on Iberia to head to Madrid (yes, I realize MAD is a hub, but I saw an American plane at the terminal, so AA flies there).  I can’t even say that upgrading your seat would be an improved experience, because Economy Plus had the same crappy, thin seats.

We were in the last zone to board the plane. When we got home, $2,039.16 worth of electronics, accessories and other belongings of mine and my family's were stolen. In addition to this sum, I had also paid 180 euros for the stolen glasses and 280 euros for the sunglasses to have them prescriptioned in Greece before I left. However, I cannot provide a receipt for the repairs because in Greece, they do not keep receipts and credit cards are not used, so everything is paid by cash.

I would greatly appreciate it if my stolen items could be refunded to me, since Iberia has shown time after time such poor professionalism and no care for their customers. I have already made a claim/complaint on the website (the reference number is P20180829-01022152). Iberia has refused to compensate me, and it is unacceptable and disgraceful that they are not willing to refund me for something that the airline was responsible for. Our luggage was YOUR responsibility, and if my belongings were stolen by your employees in the airport, then it is YOUR responsibility to compensate me, as a professional, trustworthy airline.

The ground staff is quite pleasant but the real no-no area is the flight crew. Me and my husband flew from Havana to Madrid on business class and we are sad to say the air hostesses should be dismissed as they were short, border line rude, unhelpful and very dismissive. In case this comment is seen by Iberia I will add we took the 23:25h flight from Havana Feb 6th 2019 and the only pleasant member of the crew was Paulina Moreno, the other two were absolutely awful. Their dismissive, annoyed attitude was a constant throughout the flight and turned what should have been a pleasant (and terribly expensive) experience into a miserable one. Some examples? One of the hostesses rolled her eyes and literally grunted at me when I asked her to please verify the plug as my phone wasn’t charging (it turned out the plug wasn’t working) I asked whether she could try the seat closer to the window only to get a very annoyed “have you tried your partner’s seat?” As it turned out my husband’s plug was ok but making that remark meant she didn’t have to actually do anything (I passed the phone over to my husband opposed to her having to try another plug) At dinner, they made mistakes on both of our choices but when we pointed it out to them they got annoyed, didn’t say anything but rolled their eyes up again and marched away as if it was far too much trouble to attend to us. Before we landed, breakfast was served but my husband was sleeping. He woke up about half an hour later and asked the hostess whether he could still have his breakfast or was it too late. She looked at him furiously (I am not joking!) and replied a dry “so, so” so we assumed she would check. She came back and literally dumped the breakfast tray on his table, said nothing and marched away. I had my breakfast at the right time (thankfully!) but there was turbulence so I held on to my tray and couldn’t eat until it got better. The air hostess came to collect the tray shortly after, she storms towards me and aks in a very sharp tone “are you finished?” I had my mouth full and she could see the breakfast literally intact so it was idiotic of her to ask such a question. After I managed to swallow my piece of toast I said “no” and she rolled her eyes and marched away furiously. I can only get to the conclusion staff rolling their eyes, being border line rude and marching away are a constante amongst the crew which is TOTALLY unacceptable! I wish I had made a note of the names of the two air hostesses who were in charge of business class but sadly I didn’t. Paulina Moreno, the pleasant member of staff unfortunately did not serve us throughout the flight but was terribly nice when I spoke to her before landing. For Iberia, if they see this and if they care the two ladies who “assisted” us were terrible and the worse of the two was the one who had a darker hair colour, she should be fired, to be frank. I will add I’ve traveled with Iberia from Madrid to Mexico City (business class) January 1st and the crew wasn’t friendly and helpful either although not to the degree shown on the Havana/Madrid flight. From now on I will try my best to avoid flying with Iberia and do not recommend it to anybody exception made to masoquists."

I could not tip the seat back much without interfering with the comfort of the passenger behind. I do not know why seat designers feel upright seats are best, they are not.

The reason was that Iberia failed to get de-icing for the plane, although weather conditions were not severe, the airport remained fully operational and planes were taking off and arriving around us permanently. 
We were offered a cup of water at the very beginning of the waiting time. As you can imagine, this is an unsatisfying situation without having any information.

After arriving late, a refund according to EU regulations should not have been anything like a problem, regulations are unambiguous there. 

So I filled an online form, which was difficult to find. Entered a painful online form (you have to enter every digit of your phone number from a drop-down instead of typing it and the like). You are randomly redirected to Spanish-only sites intermittently and receive page errors. Got no confirmation email or anything similar after submitting. 
Phoned the company after 3 weeks. Reaching someone halfway responsible took about an hour. They could not find my form. Also, they could not provide any contact details, phone or mail, of the customer service department. So, there is no other way of contact than to fill online forms. 

So I filled another painful form, this time receiving a confirmation mail. After some 2 weeks, a standard mail response arrived. It read """"we experience outside difficulties everyday, we are sorry if this caused inconveniences to you."""" Not a single reference to my complaint. 
I would have liked to respond to that, however the mail was sent from a no-reply address. So again, there is no other way than to fill another online form, entering and explaining all the details.

My husband and son flew to Germany from Chicago for his 16th birthday trip. Bought tickets through american, realized flight there was with British Airway and flight back was Iberia. British was wonderful!! Iberia awful!
1. My son is a junior and for some reason they could not handle the booking with similar names, so my husband could not check in or pay for the cheaper baggage options or pick seats. 
2. They lost 2,000 dollars worth of snowboard equipment! When I tried to contact customer service, I was hung up on 11 times. I could not get to a person and recording kept telling me to look online, however online just read pending. Still have not recovered items.
3. Plane was small, seats were tight and cramped. Can usually deal with that since low budget, but the lost baggage experience was awful. 
4. Customer service was awful and i was concerned that my husband and son would not get home considering the online customer service representatives reminded me of calling a telemarketing scam.

Advised that some form of compensation may be available for the very significant delays, we have spent many hours attempting to submit claims online via Iberia's website all of which have been inconclusive because the format does not recognise flights that have been cancelled and changed to other flights on outbound and incoming journeys. There is no other means of making contact. This airline should only continue to sell tickets to passengers who accept minimal customer service levels and don't have time to look around for the cheaper tickets that are available with other airlines who do actually provide a better service - Air France, KLM, LATAM for example. I wish we had read the other reviews before and realised just how bad Iberia has become. It didn't used to be this awful but we won't fly with them again until we see the reviews becoming more positive."

The extra money for this upgrade was not worth it. I will continue flying Swiss business for their excellent customer service and not fly Iberia again."

Here are some of the responses:

300 euro per ticket to change the tickets, but even when I agreed, no one was willing to take the money and print new boarding cards; 
2000 euro per ticket for a new reservation on Royal Air Maroc;

AA Connections rep told us to leave the desk since they were only in charge of  US connections;
Another Iberia rep told us to leave the airport, then come back in;
We were asked if we would like to go to other airlines to compare prices on a new flight MAD-CMN;
I phoned AA twice while in the Madrid airport, at Iberia's insistence, and was disconnected both times. 

Finally, Pilar from American Airlines escorted us to an Iberia Air desk and put her supervisor on the phone to the rep who then printed our new boarding passes.
 
Then our luggage was left behind in Madrid. At no time, were we offered an emergency toothbrush etc. As a result of our delay, we missed our free airport transfer and had to take a cab to our hotel. We spent the next day, phoning to find out the status of our luggage, and then had to travel to and from the airport to collect the bags, when they were located. We missed a day and a half of sightseeing in Morocco.

On BOTH 12 hour flights, beverages stopped being served a few hours into the flight. We were seated near the galley so we could see what was going on. Most of the plane was going up to the stewardess seated in the galley to ask for drinks and they either were told """"no"""" or """"go sit down"""" - in the rudest tone imageinable. How can you not serve drinks on a 12 hour flight? And this happened on BOTH FLIGHTS. 

On the flight back, the drinks were served only RELUCTANTLY and then 5 hours into the flight, everyone was told they were """"out"""". But for breakfast, the drinks magically re-appeared the drink and food cart was FULL. And what happened next really angered me : AFTER breakfast service the stewardesses were pouring ALL the drinks down the toilet (!) to prepare for landing

Wouldn't it have more sense to have these drinks available on a 12 hour flight instead of telling people in a rude tone to """"sit down""""

On our return flight we were prepared, we came with our own food and drinks. 
By the way, the food is atrocious - 
But we didn't know about this on our 1st flight and were literally dehydrated when we got to BsAs.

This is absolutely unacceptable on a 12 hour flight.

Aside from this, the steward/esses were all extremely unfriendly, the seats uncomfortable, the food was terrible, th bathrooms are tiny (oh yeah, and when the toilet paper runs out its out!), the plane was filthy...

On a positive note, the Iberia lounge at Madrid airport was very nice indeed - it was spacious, modern, airy and served a good selection of snacks and drinks.  However, the ground staff were perfunctory at best in their interactions with the awaiting passengers.  This theme continued onto the flight itself where the staff were surly and grumpy.  The captain/first officer did not speak to passengers at all during the 14.5 hour flight (not even the typical welcome on board, weather at destination, warnings about turbulence, etc. – the only time we heard him speak was to instruct crew to take seats for landing and take-off).    The food was not good at all and the movie choice was terrible for international travellers.  Except for the privilege of having more leg room and a flat seat to sleep (for which I am truly grateful on such a long flight) the service was akin to the worst you can find on a budget airline staffed by unmotivated and unhappy staff.  Thank goodness I flew home with BA – the difference between the two services was marked.  BA was five star in every respect.  Just wonderful.   Once again – another bad Iberia experience.

Madrid-Basel 
4th of Feb 2019

We booked our flights thru American Airlines. This is just a part of a 3-leg trip from Panama City to Basel. Our flight from Miami to Madrid was also with Iberia, and everything went ok. The Cabin Crew were very professional and helpful. It was a long haul flight. So since they are partners with American Airlines and British Airways, we didnt doubt on Iberia. Boarding was smooth. They don't speak english. They assumed all passengers who are heading to Switzerland are spanish-speaking because they are flying from Madrid. A lot other airlines are hiring bilingual cabin crew to provide better service. Some would even put atleast one FA who speaks the local language of the country of destination- if not, atleast english. Unfortunately, they dont. So sorry for those who non-spanish speakers. Lucky if you get into a flight with a cabin crew who speaks your language. Upon boarding, they have announced that there are not much space for the hand-carry luggages and they suggested the passengers to put the small bags in under the seat in front of them. We assumed that the aircraft is small and that they have smaller compartments. It wasnt too crowded at all by the way. But when we were on board, the flight attendant advised us to remove backpacks (they are not small) from the overhead compartment and put it under the seat in front of us. Again, the backpacks were not small! The allowed size of a handcarry luggage should not exceed to 56cm X 45cm x 25cm; our bag size was 50cm x 40cm x 16cm - and full. It will definitely fit under the seat, but it wont give us even a little leg comfort. I advised the FA who kept talking to us in spanish- even if we are not spanish speaker if she could choose some other smaller bags - form other passengers. We are not first-time travelers. But it was our first time with Iberia and the way they treated us- was very shocking! I don't wonder why a lot people told us """"that's the worst!"""" and we didnt listen to them. The FA called the Senior FA and the latter told us we have to put our bags under the seat in front of us. There are other jackets and bags that can be taken away from the overhead compartment, but she decided to take down our large back packs, which has cameras and other electronic devices inside. There is not even a leg room available for us at all. Out of all the passengers, they chose us- a non-spanish speaking couple. She grabbed the other bag and threw hard inside the overhead compartment. Then she grabbed a jacket from the overhead compartment, thinking it was ours, and threw it on us. I told her that is not my jacket and she said """"It doesnt matter, it has to be removed!"""" Very unprofessional! We've flown with a lot other airlines- Emirates, Qatar, British Airways, Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian, Turkish, Etihad, Garuda, Tiger, Thai, even Kuwait, and budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryan Air but we have never ever encountered an FA, a SENIOR one, with that kind of attitude. Instead of talking to me in a calm way, she raised her voice and told me """"this is the last thing I will tell you, you have to put your bags under the seat!"""" We refused, because the bags are not small not because we didnt want to take it.  It's a huge size back pack. There are other passengers who stowed jackets and smaller bags-  but she decided to decide for us. I told her that there are cameras inside- she said """"Iberia will replace it"""". They are just rude and unprofessional. They knew that there are not enough space for the hand carry luggages, they could have taken the huge handcarry luggages and put it in the baggage hold next to all other checked in luggages just like how other airlines are doing it if they failed to monitor and control them during check-in."

Today the 3th of February and I still have not received my luggage, and finding it very difficult in getting any compensation. In this period I have spoken to over seven different agents who never seem to have the information which i had given to the agent prior having me to explain the situation over again. Imagine being from the Caribbean and getting to Sweden in winter with no luggage. There is a lack of communication between agents but still no one allows you to talk to someone in authority. They asked of me some documents which I emailed right away, and after calling back a few days later the agent mentioned that she could not have opened the file, this sounded really strange but I made different set and sent it over only to call back a few days later and the agent still could open a word document. This all sounded to strange to me asked if that was really the case, after a few minutes she was now able to open the file. The effort in making customer service in companies have been lost and this is the reason why companies like Iberia Airlines have failed me terribly. Today an agent cut me off in the middle of speaking using a horrible method of just repeating that she and other calls coming and said goodbye over me speaking and hung up. This agent named Anna made me realize that i had in deed made a horrible decision in choosing Iberia Airlines. The amount of loss and effort placed in recovering my luggage was not worth it at all, this is continuing to be an up hill battle to get compensated!!!

We boarded at 2 pm (local time) were fed some kind of late lunch/early dinner at around 4 pm and then nothing at all until around 4 am when they went around serving some snackish type of breakfast!! If one was hungry in the meantime(as obviously everyone was) you had to go beg for something that vaguely resembled a club sandwich. And that was only the beginning of our troubles as they lost my luggage (they just dropped it at Madrid thus never sending it off all the way to Milan (final destination) and if it hadn't been for the amazing ladies at Linate who did their best to track it down and have it sent to my hotel asap I'd still be waiting because Iberia never answered either my emails or calls. Then, given the most uncomfortable conditions we'd had to put up with (seats are rather small) on the first flight we attempted to get emergency seats for my husband (he's 6' 4'') on the way back but they wouldn't even sell them because they claimed they were already taken and suggested we should approach the flight crew instead. We did so and they promised to help but never lifted a finger so while we patiently kept waiting for the attendants to come back to us with an answer random passengers (who were not even tall or big) happily jumped onto the few emergency seats that were free! Not to mention the total chaos that took place every single time we had to board (both in Madrid and Buenos Aires) as they couldn't even be bothered to place signs for the queues so everyone jumped into the wrong line, skipped the queue and so on. All in all, a dreadful experience that I wouldn't recommend to anyone unless you had no other choice and having said this, I'd like to point up that I've flown with various different airlines and even those from the so-called """"developing"""" countries have all been far superior in efficiency and way more generous than this airline that (one should think) represents a first-world country."

Bring water. The crew does not walk around or offer refreshmenfs outside of meal times and you have to get up and go to them if you want a drink. And the amount they give you is very small. Very.
The food was not as bad as i read. It was basically the equivalent of a frozen dinner. If you can eat Hungry man, you’ll be fine. The snack sandwich however ia disguisting. The final meal is the best one- basically a sub sandwich, a cookie, chocolate, and yogurt.
The on flight entertainment is also good.
Would i book again? Not economy. I’m 5feet and could not move. I even bought a flt hammock for my legs but it was to tight to even hang it.

1. Your seat - Iberia reduced its seat space adding more seats to the class but increased the privacy and personal space and seats are inclining to become full beds.
2. Food and drinks - frequent travelers of Iberia can see a clear down on the menus. quality of the food went slightly down with more modest presentation and no more famous Chefs on the menus. The wines level is definitely not at the level of the ticket price and the over whole feeling is that there is a money saving action taken by the company.

My seat for the first leg, Santiago to Madrid, had the worst location in the cabin, right at the front where the cabin narrows up, encroaching into the aisle, and also trafficked heavily by crew working from the galley and passengers going to the toilet. It also offered zero privacy with pretty much every passenger being able to look over each other. My seat and its surroundings were dirty, with food, hair and other residues.
The seat itself was incredibly uncomfortable. I am 6ft2, with shoulders slightly wider than average. I could not physically sit in the seat without my right shoulder overhanging into the aisle. There was literally nowhere to put my elbows either. After having my shoulder knocked too many times i sort of twisted myself into the seat which was terribly uncomfortable, which then caused pain as i have metal screws and a pin in my left leg and hip. 
The flight departed soon after 1.30pm, and almost as soon as we had reached cruising altitude we were served the """"evening"""" meal, which was mediocre at best. Later on after being hungry for several hours I discovered there were some dry, measly sandwiches in the galley which we could help ourselves to. 
The entertainment system offered a few films and TV shows, but unlike other airlines whose screens you can only see from directly behind, the array of screens across the width of the cabin was quite a nuisance when the lights were turned off. Also my screen was nit very responsive as touchscreen, and the WiFi didn't work.
After a night of zero sleep, we were served a reasonable breakfast, and eventually the end came to a torturous 12+ hour flight. 
For my 2 hour layover in Madrid airport i went to one of Iberia's lounges, which had reasonable to good shower facilities, mediocre seating, and poor food options. Better than nothing but not a patch on the lounges of British Airways or Latam.
The second leg from Madrid to London was an absolute joke. On this short haul route their idea of Business class was a normal seat with no legroom or entertainment, only towards the front of the plane and with no-one sitting in the middle seat.
In summary, Iberia's Business class is not a patch on those of other airlines. I have even flown longer distances to Australia in Emirates Economy which was far more comfortable than this experience. I would rather cross the Atlantic by rowing boat than travel with Iberia again!"

In Madrid at the boarding gate there were many people with carry-on bags, some of them with larger suitcases than mine, including other bags for the same person. I am very sure of that because one of such persons went just before me: a larger suitcase and another bag. The officer at the gate put a label on my suitcase and not on the suitcase of the other person. When entering in the plane, the flight attendant insisted to place my suitcase in the checked baggage compartment. When I argued that there was another person just in front of me having much more luggage than myself she didn't want to listen. She said in a very rude way that if I do not agree, I am not admitted on the flight. As an irony, the luggage bin above my seat remained empty during the flight, so that there was indeed place for my suitcase. I had to check the luggage. When I showed the free place to the flight attendant, she didn't even excuse herself of the abuse. To summarize, it was an abuse to ask me to check the luggage as long as there was at least one other passenger having more carry-on luggage than me.

At 8:30, we all lined up to board and then after standing for 30 minutes with no direction, we were told that the plane had a mechanical issue and that we needed to sit down. For the following three hours, we were given vague and unhelpful updates roughly once an hour. This was stressful and the staff was not apologetic. Finally, close to 11:30, we were told the flight was cancelled in Spanish. The message was not repeated in English for another three minutes. 

We then proceeded down to baggage claim and there was no one from Iberia to direct us or tell us what was happening. We waited in complete confusion for close to 30 minutes. Finally, we were let through a door and told to write our name, phone number and email on a white sheet of printer paper and that they would be getting buses to take us to a hotel. Everyone on our flight was very confused why we were being asked to write our information down as we assumed that any airline would already have this information in their system. At this point, we took a cab and returned to our apartment in Brooklyn to attempt to get some sleep. We were told we would get a phone call or text letting us know when the plane was fixed. 

At 2:53AM, we woke up to the sound of a text saying our itinerary was changed. We were now scheduled to leave on December 28th at 18:59 to London, have a three-hour layover and then take another flight from London to Madrid. I immediately called Iberia and spoke to an incredibly rude customer service rep. She told me that Iberia already changed my ticket for free so any other change would require a fee. This is absurd. I knew there was a 5:00 (17:00) direct flight on Dec 28th and I at the very least I wanted to get on that. After a very frustrating conversation with no apology, I attempted to get more sleep. 

At 7:05AM, I got another text saying that our original flight was delayed to 15:30 and to call the airport at 12:30 to check. I immediately called Iberia to ask about that flight status and why our itinerary didn’t show that flight and the customer service representative could not explain this. They said that the 15:30 flight did not exist and/or that we didn’t have tickets on it. At this point, we were confused whether we should go back to JFK with no ticket or go for our new flight with the connection. I finally reached a customer service rep, Daniel Espina who told us there was nothing he could do. At that point, I asked to speak to his manager and suddenly he said that he could get us on the 17:00 direct flight. I’m confused why this wasn’t an option from the beginning. When we arrived at the airport and returned to our original gate from the previous night around 3:45PM, we were told that our original flight from Thursday night departed at 3:30 (15:30). I do not understand why we weren’t given the option to be on that flight. The lack of clear communication is unacceptable. 

I have submitted a formal complain to Iberia about the situation, asking for reimbursement for the cabs and hotel room we had to pay for, but did not use in Spain, and I was sent a generic apology email saying it was out of their control. Having an organized professional plan when a flight is cancelled is in your control. Not having people write their contact information on a sheet of printer paper and instead having it in an online portal is in your control. Allowing us to board our original flight and being clear about when that flight would be taking off is in your control. I cannot emphasize enough, Iberia has been the most unprofessional airline I have ever experienced and I have flown too many places to count. 

I hope to be able to update this review with better information, but I’ve been on hold with the airline for the last 35 minutes… they don’t have any number you can call to submit complaints and their online complaint portal is not user friendly. I’m sadly not optimistic."

Several times after the meal we were offered after dinner drinks but we simply picked a small glass of superb Spanish Sherry. Then it was convert the seat to a flat bed for hours of sleep before a simple breakfast was served. Some cold yogurt, cold juice and cold fresh fruit with the breakfast proved to be refreshing in the too warm cabin. 
Madrid airport is huge but the long walks felt good after sitting or sleeping in a hot plane cabin for hours.
We always take the three euro +/- express train straight in to Madrid which is so convenient when you arrive with your luggage and jet lag.
Our return trip a little over three weeks later went just as smoothly. The Iberia lounge at Barajas airport provides complete breakfast choices so we skipped eating at our hotel, took the express train back to the airport and enjoyed a relaxing breakfast before take off. Once again the food was excellent, inflight entertainment was more than adequate and the flat beds allowed for napping before arrival.
More excellent Iberia flights."

I sat in 10A on an A319 which was an exit row and window seat. An FA did approach me to remind me of the requirements of sitting in the exit row. After eventually working out that I didn't speak Spanish, the FA raced through the clearly scripted English version of the text, so quickly that most of the words were jumbled up and nearly incomprehensible. Apart from that, there was absolutely no interaction with the crew throughout the entire flight. They did the absolute bare minimum required and that was it. With rather scared looks on their faces, they wandered down the plane with their food options (all of which one had to pay for), almost seemingly hoping that they wouldn't have to sell anything or interact with anyone. After they retreated to the back galley they were not sighted for the remainder of the two hour flight. Most travellers had their armrest up for landing, and there were a few window shades that were kept down despite an announcement made from the back. The physical seat is also terrible. It was so thin that it felt like I could've torn through it with a fingernail and a piece of crispy bacon. The armrest was also so short that it was virtually useless, we might not as well have had it. The legroom in the exit row was sufficient, however, if an emergency did happen, I would not want to be a person of great width trying to escape using the exit row as opposed to the front or back doors, as I sense that would be difficult. The interior of the cabin felt very plain, boring and uninviting. It was almost like a Ryanair jet but without the advertising or colour. To make thighs worse for IB, I flew back that evening on British Airways, and had an amazing crew. I would literally say that the BA crew belt the living daylight out of the effort (or lack thereof), of the IB crew, and then some. Based on this singular experience, I would avoid IB at all costs, and fly BA wherever possible instead."

I had to check in my cabin baggage, although correct size, check in clerk said possibly insufficient room on plane but they would check it in for free. I padlocked it. When I finally got to Santiago, the lock had been ripped off and thrown back inside the case, the gifts I had had been broken into and a mans watch had been stolen. The flight left one hour late and as a result I missed my connecting flight at Madrid and was put in a substandard hotel near Madrid and told they couldn’t get me on a flight for 2 days. They wouldn’t let me have my cabin luggage because by the time they got around to dealing with me they said the baggage place was closed, so I had no overnight things, clothes, toiletries etc. I arrived at my destination 44 hours later than scheduled. That was 2 days I lost with my young grandson who I had not seen for 2 years. When I submitted a complaint and in particular a request for EU flight compensation, I asked for the reason for the delay and got a stupid response that the delay was beyond their control, but still no actual reason or explanation. I submitted the complaint again and took advice from the consumer advice service which provided the correctly worded letter template for EU flight delay compensation and they replied that I was inconvenienced because of something beyond their control and no explanation. They closed down my complaint references without any explanation or apology.  The return flight on 09/01/2019 was shambolic!  The steward was rude when I got up and asked for water having been seated for several hours and I was thirsty and becoming dehydrated.  The steward was sitting in the galley reading a newspaper.  He sent me back to my seat.  When I brought the water I asked him where the call button was and he told me that it was only for emergencies and asking for water was not an emergency.  So there is no proper “in service” because the crew are too busy faffing in business class or sitting on their backsides reading newspapers.   When I arrived at Madrid the information board didn’t provide connecting flight info. It just said to contact the company!  How?  Why?  No idea!  Had to go to the VIP lounge to ask where passengers were meant to go and the information provided contradicted with the boarding card.  Even asked an airport policeman and he said the boarding card information was wrong.  The whole experience with Iberia was shambolic!  Added to this was that you now have to pay for alcohol on long haul trips, other than wine with dinner ( which I don’t drink). It costs 5 euros for a tot of whisky.  Staff are rude and surly.  If they think they are special because they work on a plane they need to remember that passengers pay their wages.  If I can avoid flying Iberia I definitely will look at the alternatives even if it means paying a little more.  Shocking service, shocking manners.  What a bunch of cowboys."

The second arrived four hours late, so late I missed the lecture I was due to give. Iberia's commercial tactic used to avoid the claims passengers affected by such delays can correctly submit is simply not to inform those passengers of their rights, or reply to them or their legal representatives when they do complain and claim.

Second, I am due to fly with Iberia (that was a mistake!) tomorrow from London to Chile. Despite all the encouragement to do so, when you try and check in online, nothing happens. When you eventually find a number to contact to find out what is going on, you discover that part of the website is down and will be for the foreseeable future (day at least). Simple common sense says they should put a notice saying this on their main website, but do they, NO!! And the person you speak to seems to have no comprehension that this is pretty dismal service worthy of an apology. However I wonder if this is because there is actually a customs/baggage strike at Madrid airport that I suspect Iberia don't want you to know about, and when you do follow the instructions and try and check in at the airport itself you will discover that your flight has actually been cancelled at which point you are captive to their incpompetence."

It is sort of throw back to the late 1960's, early 1970's era of flying. No comforts afforded, not even an electronic check in. And, of course, since Spanish don't like arguing and conversing at all... the lines at the check-in counters, only 7 counters, with 2 reserved for biz and 1st classes, move at just about the speed of a race between two slugs on valium. In fact, the later might be even faster.

Kidding aside, I am surprised they do not use abbaccus instead of computers behind the counter. Such would give it that """"je ne quois"""" authenticity to the caveman's check-in counter.

Oh, yeah... their app. LOL!!! Yep, it has graphics, and links you can tap. The only problem is that it is very X-gen/Millennial... works whenever it feels like it. Actually, in 5 years of travelling (yeah, I booked AA, but somehow IB shows up...) it hasn't worked once!

BTW, if you booked your flight to MAD with AA, and you end up with IB, attempt to Check-In via AA app... it sends you to IB's app, which, when it decides to work, says that you are being sent back to the AA app, since you booked the ticket with AA.

Unfortunately my luggage did not arrive at Miami. Calling Iberia now for 4 days in a row, without any results. They are telling each time how sorry they are and that they will contact the airport. However they never give any feedback or status update.
As I arrived with only winter clothes, I have to buy clothes, shoes, sun glasses, a nice suite for the dinners during the cruise etcetera. When asking for compensation for these costs, they are telling me that I can get compensation up to EUR 50/day. They could however not tell me how I can buy the most necessary stuff for this lousy amount of money. It will just be enough to buy some sun cream and a pair of havaianas...
Worst thing is, they seem not to care. Maybe they are already used to spoiling other's holidays and money and not able anymore to empathize with the situation of their customers and actively seek a solution to the problems they are causing themselves.
I do strongly recommend to avoid Iberia, unless you are traveling with cabin luggage only."

You have to check in through a separate line in Spain.  You can not get anyone on the phone EVER who will do anything for you whatsoever.  On the plus side, the plane was new.  Premium Economy gives you slightly more on Iberia than it does on United or Delta.  But none of that matters if your seat is next to the exit and galley on an overnight flight.

Safety didn’t seem to be a priority as far as pre-take off and landing checks were concerned. Very cursory cabin checks were undertaken and large carry on bags were allowed to remain on seats for both take off and landing. The crew seemed totally disinterested in the safety implications.

Food and beverage service seemed to be a chore. On one occasion I went to the galley to request a drink, two staff were idly chatting to each other. Despite one of them certainly being aware of my presence they totally ignored me and disappeared in the other direction!

The toilet was a disgrace and didn’t appear to have been cleaned throughout the 11 hour flight.

The only positives were the excellent information provided from the flight deck and the fact that the flight landed an hour early. The latter was of little benefit to us as we had an onward connection."

During the long transatlantic flight, meals were handed out to only a few people - we originally thought people had bought the meals,  But on the flight back, we must have hit the jackpot because we got the meals when people around us didn’t.  No tea or coffee service either - this on a flight with a lot of small children.  Very strange.
Then pilot made 2 attempts to land in ORLY, couldn’t land because of low visibility so we were rerouted to Brussels. Things went from bad to worse.  Air crew asked us not to ask them any questions - and that ground crew would take care of our transport to Paris.  Baggage took forever to arrive on the belt. Then all of us had to run around asking for help and finally told to wait near the info desk (or run from pillar to post).  Finally after 2 hours, airport staff arrived to let us know that a bus had been arranged (for a flight that was full!) and could take 50 - starting with families with small children etc.  There was utter chaos.
Then when it was finally determined there were less than 100 people waiting - the rest had sensibly made their own arrangements, we were told there were 2 buses on the way.  Our scheduled arrival at Orly at booking time was 11:10 am, which changed to 1:15 pm on the day of the flight.  We reached Paris just before midnight that day - with not a single complimentary meal or drink from Level/Iberia.

12/21 - was told at the luggage desk our luggage had been left in London but that one bag would be delivered that evening.

Later called multiple times, lost luggage line is always a busy signal. Finally when contacting the reservation line was transferred to lost luggage who reiterated that the luggage would be delivered asap. Unhelpfully, we needed o take an onward journey, but Iberia was not able to tell us what the process wig our lugage would be.

12/22 - called, lost luggage line was busy. After waiting on hold for an hour was told lost luggage was not in operation over the weekend so we had no means of receiving updates except via the website.

12/24 - called at 12:03, spoke to Noel Vin, was told they could not transfer us to lost luggage. When trying to contact lost luggage via her direction, the line did not work (as before, continuous busy signal).

On calling a second time was told we could not be transferred to lost luggage because the operator did not have that ability. We were given a non-functional Spanish number to call about our lost luggage.

12/26, 12/27, 12/28

I was supposed to receive a meal on an 8 hour flight, but the flight attendants said I was not on their list and provided all the other passengers around me with their meals. After speaking with a representative after my flight, I received a confirmation that I was was supposed to receive a meal. 
You cannot complain to any person, but only file a complaint online. When I tried to speak with a supervisor, they claimed there isn't one.

Obviously philly doesn’t have any Iberia customer service department so we mostly went through American Airlines who were surprisingly helpful.  
When we tried calling Iberia, we only got a voice prompt and when you ask for baggage department you seem to have a 50/50 shot of going to a person who can’t tell you anything and cannot transfer you to a department that can and they just tell you to call back and say “baggage reclaim. “ the other times you get a recorded voice message that tells you to look for your bags online.

The handoff between BA and Royal Air was in Madrid, which luggage in Madrid is handled by Iberia. We believe the bags were lost there. When we arrived off our flight from Casablanca, the bags never arrived. Air Maroc refused to file a lost luggage claim, because our luggage was not in there system, but when we called BA and also Iberia, they both told us they can’t do it because international policy states that the last leg were the bag was lost is responsible, and hence it’s Royal Air Maroc, as that was the last leg. We called Iberia begging for assistance since we purchased the flights through them, and neither BA or Royal Air Maroc  were “able” to file the claim. We called two separate times, my partrner called once, and I a separate time, both times they said there was nothing that they could do, and hung up, Anna, the woman I was speaking with, said there was no manager and nothing they could to, click. I was so shocked! We purchased the ticket though Iberia and they linked the flights  through  BA and Royal Air. If neither BA or Royal Maroc claim responsibility, then who? Iberia is the company whom we purchased and Iberia is also the company that handles baggage in Madrid for BA and Air Maroc. It’s incredibly offensive to have neither airline take responsibility and literally leave you in an impossible  position.

I would like to give my opinion for those who travel with special luggage through Iberia. I had to bring two snowboards on different flights and on both ... something happened.

As you know, you have to call another cost number to hire special staff... so since the beginning something does not like so good... not once but two calls to confirm.

After that, at the airport, you never know if your luggage has been confirm or not. And if yes... how much. Despite the fact you might have agreed 45 euro... you need to cross your fingers at the airport during the check in because they might have forgotten it.

The first time, we were waiting a long time but the second was catastrophic. The lady attending us did not understand nothing at all ( talking in her language) because without our will, she charged automatically 60 euros for snowboard ( WITHOUT PIN CODE REQUEST) we said that we pay 45 which is the price agreed by phone. After talking to manager, ok anyone can make mistakes so they will return our 60euros... after paying 45 euros in additio!!n ( those agreed) Ok it is Iberia not another low cost company. They told us they will be returned back. 

After a week, still my bank account has 60 euros less so let’s discuss  again upon arrival again in Athens.

To sum up, personal at the airport told us to call Iberia by phone because they can not do anything even Acknowing the problem!

Ok call Iberia, by phone they can do nothing just though customer service website.

Ok kindly contact to customer service,  explained all facts ( I think it is something which usually happens in any shop and they simply  return your money to the same credit card). However they communicated me that this is the price for hand luggage which they asked me to bring down instead at the cabin because of lack of space for free!!!

This is not posible because at the airport they knew and know  about their mistake charging 60 euros in addition. So another message with the same result and 60 euros donation to Iberia by themselves.

I just can not believe that such “good company” which all of us trust to travel and move important things, acts like this. If you must move special luggage like me please CHOOSE ANOTHER  because they have lost the reputation they had for 60 euros.

I hope my experience is useful for someone else. I don’t know how this procedure is on others but once you have to call  to a cost number.... bad feeling...

My flight should leave at 1:00PM and there would be a second flight to Brazil at 4:30PM but Iberia canceled my flight to join the passengers of the two flights on the 4:30PM flight. Iberia did not provide any kind of explanation to the passengers and also did not give any type of support until the moment of shipment. Neither water.
At flight 4:30PM boarding procedure was a total mess because there were duplicate seats marked and Iberia to refrain from solving the problem simply informed that the seats marked was canceled and would be worth the order of arrival on the plane.
After everyone boarded and the passengers themselves solved the seating problems (the crew just stay seeing and did nothing) the plane began to tax and there could be a noise as if there was a problem in the landing gear. The plane returned to the finger and disembarked of the aircraft for an evaluation.
After an hour of waiting, new boarding and when we began to tax we heard the same noise.
The scareds passengers asked that the plane return to the finger to leave tha aircraft and but they was ignored by the crew. Many desperate passengers stood up as the plane headed for the takeoff place, but the crew simply asked to be seated and the take-off procedure continued.
It was the first time I saw dozens of passengers standing (that's right, standing) during a takeoff.
Total panic.
I made a complaint upon arriving in Brazil for the Iberia office but there was no response. I think that they not read it at all.

Apparently they were having problems with their systems. 

At the gate there was no special recognition of business class passengers and we were all herded onto a crowded bus. Awful. Felling pretty disgruntled and fed up, I climbed the steps to the plane but once inside things started to look up. I had Seat 1C in business class. The configuration is 1/2/1. Actually I thought that the seats were similar to those in the excellent Emirates business class on their A380. This plane was, however, an A 330-200. 

Service started with a small hot towel delivered on a little white tray and a choice of cava, orange juice or water before take off. Once in the air we were served dinner. The starters was a full tray of delicacies such as tuna carpacchio, cheddar cheese (!), chicken consomme and a small salad. For the main course I had the wild mushroom and artichoke ravioli. Noticing Pacharan on the drinks list I had a glass as an apertitif. Afterwards I focused on the red wine which was Luis Cana Reserva Seleccion de Familia 2012. After the pistachio ice cream with flaked almonds as a dessert I couldn't resist a glass or two of Gran Duque de Alba brandy. To top off an excellent evenings meal I tried the very sweet Cardenal Cisneros sherry from Jerez de la Frontera. The service was impeccable was throughout.

Their check in attendants rude and not helpful at all. They state in their flight magazine that all flights land and takeoff from the same terminal in Madrid. This is not the case. It took over 30 minutes of traveling the airport to get to our gates coming and going. And this was quite a challenge because we had about 30 minutes to get to our gate due to a late departure from Tenerife caused by the most disorganized boarding process I have ever witnessed.  

On the first half of our trip - They lost our bags in Madrid and would not deliver to our villa. Told us to check online for the bags arrival and come to the airport to pick up which we did. When we arrived for our bags, they said we couldnt have them until 8:30pm which was hours away so we incurred more transit fees to go back at 8:30 for our bags.  When we arrived to Miami on the return flight our connections were all canceled due to weather. Only one bag of seven made it to Miami. We were told a bag was in JFK, one wasn’t scanned at all and the rest were in Madrid. Long story short on the baggage we finally picked up several missing bags in Charlotte our original final destination and one bag was delivered to my daughter’s home.  

The flight attendants were rude and heaven forbid if you asked for something to drink! But when you declined coffee during meal service they continued to ask you if you wanted coffee. No, I don’t want coffee - I want some dang water.  If they have you water, it was a mere 3-4 oz with no offer to refill. We were dehydrated after our 9 hour flight.  

The staff at the airports and on phone were of no help. All they would do is deflect your questions and tell to go to someone else for help. The Iberia customer service person in Miami at baggage was barely a live human being.  He was so old and couldn’t work his computer or flip phone. He told us to go to American Airlines for help since our US flights were on American Airlines which didn’t make sense as Iberia is the airline that had our luggage. This man literally took about 30-34 minutes per

When I printed my boarding pass, it said right on in that luggage was not included. Not sure if I was going to be caught having to pay more at the baggage drop, I called their help line and they confirmed that I did in fact have luggage included- their boarding passes just say that it's not.... how nice! Not the end of the world but can cause unnecessary confusion. THEN, when I was traveling, the agent who checked my luggage failed to notice my full flight itinerary and labelled Madrid as the final destination for my luggage. Though I wish I had noticed sooner, I luckily thought to ask about it when I arrived in Madrid.

I finally went to FinnAir (they're part of the OneWorld network) and used their website to update passport data, emergency contact info, and get boarding passes. 

We had a mix of seats on the flight going over and coming home. Going over to Madrid from Miami we upgraded to Business Plus and that was fine, not exceptional, but okay. Nice seat to sleep in since it pushed out. Large TV screen and food/meals were good, especially the wine. The flight from Madrid to Rome was more tight with the seat back of the previous row in your face. This was only a 2 1/2 hour flight so we could live with that. Let me say that Iberia appears to fly their international flights in and out of Madrid from a satellite terminal, 4S, which is way off from the main terminal. It took about 25-30 minutes to get to the main terminal where we had to catch the next leg to Rome. To get there was a combination of elevators, escalators, tram, and walking. Plan accordingly if you're connecting through the satellite terminal. 

Coming back was a really short light from Barcelona to Madrid, no big deal. But, we arrived in the main terminal and then had to get to the Madrid satellite terminal, check in with passport control, and then a second passport control by the US agents in terminal 4S. We just made our flight and we had over an hour between flights, which was not enough time. BTW, early on, Iberia had changed the time of the first leg of our trip from Miami to Madrid and never looked at the connecting leg. We would have completely missed our connecting flight. Who in the heck does that? I noticed it and called to have them change our flight from Madrid to Rome.

I was appalled by the lack of instruction from the flight attendants when landing in Miami. We were still on the runway and taxiing to the gate when people began standing up and moving down the aisle to get in line. People were also opening up the overhead compartments while the plane was moving. A real safety hazard, especially if a bag came out of the overhead. No one in charge said anything.

This didn't sound like a mistake I would do, so I went through the process of buying another flight to check how Iberia asks for their passenger details. I have noticed that their contact detail box says: Name, Surname/Last Name, Second Last name. (screenshot attached).

My full name: Andre Manuel Leite Fonseca. When I had to fill the below form, I wrote that my last name was: Fonseca. I understand that Spanish surnames work in a different way but my last (ULTIMO) name IS Fonseca, indeed. 

I thought that I would quickly solve this over a phone call. I was wrong. Called the costumer service, and after wasting a few hours of my evening, I was told over and over that I had to pay a fee of 30 pounds for each ticket to change the names. I am shocked. 

I understand that in Spain surnames don't work quite in the same way. However, last name, is last name.(""""último"""" in spanish) And my last name is Fonseca. I do have another surname, which is Leite, and that is what I thought I had to write on the second box.

I felt comfortable selecting the Iberia flight knowing that the two airlines merged several years ago , and I assumed they would be quite similar in standard. Unfortunately that was not the case, Iberia is a vastly inferior service with lazy staff who treat passengers with disdain.
We flew in Premium Economy(PE), something that IB has added to their aircraft around 18 months ago; we traveled on a Airbus 340-600. 
Boarding: the gate was absolute chaos- no signage to indicate where each class of travel should queue, and only 2 staff members to manage a crowd of 350 passengers. No priority given to people in wheelchairs or families traveling with push buggies etc. 
Onboard: the PE hard product looked good; Seats were standard premium economy and the bulkhead seat was spacious. The tv screens were modern- large with sharp picture quality. Unfortunately there were several coffee stains on the cabin walls and my footrest was broken. 
The crew: they were very lax. No cabin crew pointing out emergency exit, or any form of demo - just a pre recorded met. Throughout the 12 hour flight when ever the captain turned on the fasten seatbelt sign (5-6 times) , the crew only made verbal announcements but no crew member actually came round to check that passengers were safely buckled up. When there was turbulence during meal service the crew would just carry on - even walking around with a hot pot of coffee serving passengers! The toilets were dirty all three times I used the facilities- no crew went in to tidy it at any point during the flight. The crew were literally just doing the bare essentials- well, not even. They were not particularly friendly either, no smiles no banter, just dropped the food on your tray table and moved to the next seat. Between meal service there were no crew to be seen. 
The food and beverages: the food in PE was economy food, as were the beverages (wine choice was “red or white”) and no spirits were served. No pre meal drinks service either. The food menu listed did not match the food being served. 
Summary: Iberia as a whole were extremely disappointing. The crews lack of adherence to standard air safety protocol is concerning. Iberia’s premium economy product was well below par and not worth what you pay for it.

The flight to Spain went well, however the seats were extremely uncomfortable & barely padded. I have flown on an economy airline with more comfortable seats. The in flight service also was so-so, with such a long 10+ hour flight, I typically get multiple offers of water or beverages, with Iberia I did not. 
However this is not the sole important reason I would not recommend this airline nor EVER fly with them again. Upon my flight home, Iberia booked me with a 55 minute layover at a different city in Spain. My flight to the USA ended up being almost an hour delayed due to inspections by the pilot. The flight home was similar to the flight there as far as the comfort & in flight service. However spoon arriving at my destination, I was told that my luggage did not make it on the plane due to the “quick” layover that Iberia scheduled for me. I ended up getting 
my luggage back 2 days later. 
I have been in contact with the airline regarding compensation (EU law has passenger rights in that airlines must compensate passengers) to which the airline is responding in circles stating I have to upload documents that were already sent.

I will NEVER fly Iberia again & will not advise any of my friends or family to fly with them or their partners. If you’re flying to Europe stick with reliable airlines such as KLM, United or Delta. You don’t want to lose your luggage or sit in an uncomfortable plane, it’s not worth it!!"

Due to the boarding disorganisation, when I reached my seat, all the upward compartments were occupied, at the point that cabin crew allowed me to put my stuff in one of their compartments.
Food and Beverage: very poor and not the best quality, also limited in variety. Nothing was offered out from the established meals, say, snacks, drinks, etc.

First the good points: I am quite tall (1.80m) and I have very long legs, and the legroom in premium economy was perfectly allright. However, that's about it.
The service was rude and unfriendly. I asked for headphones and was lectured by the flight attendant that I had to wait my turn, but not in a nice, but extremely rude way. 
The veggie meal was HORRIBLE. As usual, the """"ovo lacto"""" vegetarian option was actually the vegan option, but the vegan option that is also the diet version. If you are anorexic, go for it. I got rice with no sauce, and some vegetables, no bread, just crackers, and some transfatty margerine, the fruits were nice, surprisingly enough. then, at some point, I got a salad with nothing else (whilst meat eaters were fed properly), the salad was tiny, the dressing extremely bland (but greasy), and again, nothing to accompany it. Later on, I got a sandwich, with - you'll probably work it out - salad inside, white bread with salad. So 0 protein in 10 hours. Luckily enough I was aware of the fact that this might happen, and had 2 cheese sandwiches with me, which saved me.
I mean, I am absolutely happy to have a vegan meal, but give me some protein, allright? The amount of food you get for 1.500€ is ridiculous, and outright bad. 
Other companies have learned and now offer protein (hummus, stuff like that) for vegans, so taking a vegan meal on airlines that seriously care about their customers can be a positive surprise, because very often they really go for the healthier options.
Seriously, if I can avoid it, I'll never fly Iberia again. The combination of having rude flight attendants (did I tell you that they rolled their eyes when I asked for orange juice, coke, AND water, in order to at least make the tiny meal become bigger in my stomach) plus being hungry, and being stuck there for 10 hours was simply horrible.

After speaking to the people we booked the flight with, they put us at the emergency exit seat which wasn’t an issue. Until we got on. Bearing I’m mind mynwofe was nervous as hell, the Crew person hurried her along and also put a hand on her which I took serious offence too. Then they wanted us to move to the rear of the plane, which then I told them to go away madness leave us alone after a lengthy argument. Trying to find telephone numbers or email addresses to complain is near on impossible, and when I did complain, I never got a single response.

At Madrid Barajas Airport, Iberia has a huge presence, both in terms of available check-in gates and personnel. If you're flying in business class you have access to priority security checks and priority boarding: you will avoid queuing, especially at rush hours. The personnel is very helpful and attentive, and the lounge is very nice. The flights are generally on time, and this was no exception.

Not exactly a bargain fare, but better than alternatives on other airlines.  However, another airline would have been cheaper had the seat selection fees been added onto the fare!  So the flights were sold to me under false pretenses when comparing my options! Also, in choosing which economy fare to book, I chose regular vs basic economy for the outflight, as the comparison of the two did say seat selection would be extra for basic economy (that was the only advantage) and the price difference seemed worth it since seat selection was """"up to $40"""" (though that was implied to be FOR THE ENTIRE FLIGHT EACH WAY, NOT PER LEG OF THE 3-LEGGED TRIP!).  I did choose basic economy for the return trip as the price difference was greater, so I was willing to pay an extra $40 for each ticket for seat selecton.  Much to my surprise, in managing my booking, a fee of $18-$37 was being charged for EACH LEG of the trip, on both the outgoing and incoming flights, for regular seats (exit rows are even higher)!  The only seats I was able to reserve for free are for the short ORD-CVG flight on AA, but NOT the AA flight out, from CVG-MIA.  Seat selection is not even available at a price for that flight.  I called Iberia to complain, in hopes they would assign seats for me.  When the agent tried to do that for the MIA-MAD flight, the charge was $37 and she apparently couldn't waive the charge though she admitted I had booked an economy flight, not basic economy, and that the only difference between the two is (supposedly) seat selection, which I was being denied!  I asked for a supervisor to call me back last night, which of course never happened, I have now been on hold with them for 20 minutes, no msgs stating how long the hold time is, or anything.  Now, in going to Manage My Booking, I see that the entire trip, all 3 legs, outgoing (the one I paid more for, for Economy rather than Basic Economy) now mysteriously says """"seat selection unavailable""""!! That happened since last night, so now there isn't even an option to pay for them!  For the return trip (which I'd booked at Basic Economy, so DID expect to pay for seat selection, but only up to $40 for the entire trip, not 3 separate fees--well, for some reason the short AA flight was reservable for no fee, so it is the 2 Iberia flights now--of up to $37 each!!).  There seems to be no resolution to my complaint, I would have booked the Basic Economy flights the entire way, rather than a higher fare that was described as including seat selection, had I known.  Or chosen a different airline, entirely, at a somewhat higher fare!!  Presenting these fares side by side in search engines for comparison with higher fares that include seat selection, without an upfront disclosure, is highly deceptive!  Does anyone here have any suggestions for possible recourse?  And I am STILL on hold, wondering  now whether my number has been  coded to never get a response! It is just dead silence, no music, no """"continue to hold"""" or """"leave number for callback"""" messages, NOTHING! I believe my booking, which was confirmed (before I knew about these outrageous extra fees) is nonrefundable, or at least with heavy penalty for refunds + I have already booked an airbnb in Madrid for the overnight layover there."

Noboby had heard of them. Its checking counters were in a total chaos. No employee at LEVEL had any idea about how to check-in people.

Now we got to Newark on time, nothing to report about the flight... But one piece of luggage was missing. 3 other people's luggage were missing too: one had come from Madrid through Paris to Newark, the other from Barcelona, the last I do not know but they were missing their car baby bassinet.

She said she did not know what to do except take our names and the  ticket for the luggage and gave us a phone number for Iberia. . She became aggressive when I insisted we needed a tracking number. LEVEL does not have any organisation: we learn they subcontract to a Manhandling co. the opening of their check-in counters at Newark (7pm to 9pm) to coincide with the flight back to Paris, and ditto for boarding the flight later. in the next week, Iberia kept insisting they needed a PIR number to track the whereabouts of the luggage (the code bar on the cheats could have told them... but no Iberia at Newark and no LEVEL either. .

Even though my cabin luggage, which I normally  keep with me because of its contents, included many personal items (computer, jewelry, medicine), I complied with the request and checked both my suitcase (from a previous international flight) and my cabin luggage. It turned out that the flight was not full since I had a free seat next to me. Upon arrival in Munich, I found out, to my horror, in my cabin luggage, that the thick nylon thread in three of my unfinished necklaces which I was in the process of making was cut in the middle, and a finished pair of earrings was completely destroyed, its red stone torn off (Pictures were sent to Iberia). It was obvious that those pieces of jewelry were unfinished, so I cannot understand why they were slashed and made useless. I had an event to attend as soon as I arrived in Munich, so I had to finish some of them. Apparently, nothing  seemed to have been stolen, just destroyed. It is therefore a case of useless vandalism out of spite for not finding more precious jewelry. May I add that there was no note warning me of any search, and that the size of my cabin luggage was WELL UNDER the limit of the size allowed for such a luggage."

The next flight was 5 HOURS LATER than the booked one, too late for catching further connections from Milan or be there at the necessary time for personal reasons (example: funeral). I - together with other passengers - had to BUY an entirely new (and expensive) flight with another company to compensate for Iberia's delay. I asked Iberia customer service to put me on an earlier flight of one of the many partner airlines they have, even at a different destination in Italy (Rome or Catania) and pay myself for the administrative expenses for this change.

You can read the comments, which almost all of them are negative all over the internet. 

As for the Iberia flight from Los Angeles to Madrid, I would say the legroom was ok, the seat comfort was ok, the food was good, but could be a lot better with the proper choices. The cheesecake dessert was best among the other items of the meal. in-flight entertainment was good, there were enough movies, games, and music. We received free headphones and blanket and a cushion for the back.

The only and the most bothering problem was the service. I saw many itty bitty and sometimes very basic shortcomings that brought my satisfaction down. Just in 2 flights this is what I noticed that cannot be just accidental:

- one of the hostesses hit me almost everytime she was passing by my seat. 

- time to time the hit the cart to the back of the seat where the seats in the middle turns to 4 instead of 3

- the hostess pour coffee on my wife's hand

- I saw they dropped a coca cola can, yes, it was open

- On the return flight, while embarking a family with many members cut the entire line and once a senior hostess questioned them, they started to make a scene and there was a big miscommunication among the crew and then they started to pin the fault on each other etc, they could not stop the family and everyone was really pissed about the inability of the crew doing their job

- there were a couple of crew, a guy and a girl that were serving passenger in different aisles, they were making eye contacts and showing face gestures etc that looked so unprofessional and that was kind of the reason they were making mistakes, like hitting the seats, dropping things etc

- a passenger while asleep drop her chips can and people were walking and it was big mess, the crew did not try to pick it up and clean the mess a bit at all

-WORST OF ALL: on a 13-hour flight, people sleep and they cannot get out and disturb the adjacent passenger because they get thirsty. The cabin air is always dry and one needs to hydrate constantly. The cabin crew did not even badge to pass waters quietly during the sleeping time. I have flown many times and I have not seen any airline NOT do this. instead, every time I went to the galley at the back of the flight, they were chit-chatting and you needed to ask them for water.

This experience has been by far the worst on flights to and from London. From Granada to London, I had flights booked in advance, with confirmation however I chose not to specifically reserve a seat. On getting to the check in, I was told I was on a standby list as the flight was overbooked and I would have to wait till the end of check in to see if I would be allowed on the flight. At the gate I was refused entry to the flight and told to wait while a member of staff """"sorted the issue"""". I had to wait nearly an hour for them to arrange me new transit flights to Madrid and then onto London, but with a 3hr wait in Granada airport. This meant I had to cancel train tickets I had pre-booked. I was given a ticket to compensate for only €125 which does not cover the inconvenience and stress caused. Now 1 day before my return flight to Granada, having confirmed my 2nd flight I receive an email to say that my flight has been cancelled with no explanation given and no offer of compensation.

The flight from Las Palmas to Madrid was fine but the nightmare started when we arrived at Madrid Airport. We followed the rule of always checking the boarding gate for updated details and the board indicated that we had to go to the Sattelite terminal to catch the connection to Split. We asked several people including people who worked there that we had to go to Sattelite terminal as indicated by the board. We then had to go through Immigration which seemed strange to ke as we were transit passengers. There were massive queues trying to be processed and airport attendants who were just rude and totally usless and who couod not even answer basic questions. After finally getting through to the boarding gate which clearly had a sign indicating SPLIT (Croatia) there was no one there. We then went to the Iberia desk and instead of trying to assist us they did not want to know about our problem instead blaming us and one staff member even swore at us. At this stage there was a group of young Americans who were also caught in this situation having seen the same boarding gate details as we did. We were then directed to other Iberia counters and were sent from counter to another and finally after some pleading we were put on the next day flight but we now had to stay overnight in Madrid at our own expense and we were told our luggage had gone to Croatia which was incorrect but this was conveyed to us by airline staff. Suffice to say this was a very stressful situation and it was made even worse by the rudeness and unprofessional attitude of Iberia Airlnes staff.

That is up until, Sunday Sept 30.2018 
Essentially, Iberia airlines provided a wrong gate number for my connecting flight from Madrid to Dubrovnik on Sept 30th 2018 and what happened next is beyond any customer service and I personally am appalled by Iberia airlines staff at Madrid airport. 

so here we go;
I flew from Miami to Madrid and had a connecting flight to Dubrovnik, Croatia with about an hour between arrival and departure. Being in good shape and with boarding passes in hand from Miami I made it to the gate stated throughout the screens and on the boarding pass - S 38. Moreover, a nice gesture from your part is a representative as we disembarked the plane for all express connecting passengers with new envelopes and boarding passes with gate info.
To my surprise, upon arriving to designated gate at the time of boarding stated on boarding pass there was no one  there, screen showing Dubrovnik boarding and doors to linkway closed and locked. Shortly after other passengers show up with same gate number but still no one from ground personnel around. All of us connecting flights I might add. (Chicago, Miami, Brazil...)
There was no plane connected to the link and still no one around. Again, the screen said boarding for Dubrovnik and correct gate on the boarding pass. I eventually found Iberia airlines representative at the nearby customer service desk and explained the situation. He followed me to the gate and basically said he could not do anything (service fail 1). Could not contact anyone or find out where the plane and the gate actually were?? This was now 15 minutes prior to departure time. At that moment a phone rings at the desk and representative has a conversation in Spanish. After about 10 min of phone call he informed us that the plane has to go and Captain decided so. Our luggage would be offloaded and we had to collect it and proceed to another customer service desk where they should provide us with alternative flights. I asked if someone can accompany us as there were 8 of us and were bounced from desk to desk, as this clearly was not our mistake but Iberia airlines ground operators'. we were at the designated gate at the designated time. He said no, he cannot accompany us or provide any further assistance. He told us to follow baggage claim sign and after we collect our luggage to look for customer service desk. This took us another hour to get our luggage as we had to explain at 2 different counters what had happened. (Service fail 2)

After retreiving luggage we were told to go 2 floors up to Iberia ticket sale counter. Of course, again we had to explain why we are there etc... the gentleman redirected us to another counter as he could not help us. Again explanations are in order and all of them do not speak good english. This was now at another Iberia ticket sale and overweight luggage counter. the lady at the counter stood there looking very confused after we explained why we were sent there etc... I asked if she needed our boarding passes and if she can call a manager for us. She collected all our boarding passes and said would try her best to assist us with another flights. That we should wait for about half an hour. We waited for over an hour and another blond lady steps out and said we will have to fly to Barcelona and then to Dubrovnik and would be able to reach Dbv by 9pm - a whole day delay. (Did not catch her name but I asked if she was a manager and she said yes.) Now is a good time to mention that among 8 of us was 80+ year old woman. Standing by the counter for over an hour as there were no seats available some of us sat on the floor. still no boarding passes or any explanation as to what happened and why we were given wrong Gate number. this manager told us to wait there again. 15 minutes later we finally asked again if anything is sorted and one of the representatives was surprised no one approached us. Finally someone shows up with vouchers and told us we are flying to Venice now??? first and than Dbv. At this time I asked if we will be getting any kind of vouchers for a meal or a bottle of water. The lady said no even after I pointed out an old lady among us. Then i asked for the manager's business card or a manager to come out. As soon as i asked we could literally see the manager running from back office towards the elevators and disappearing. Seconds later another man comes out saying he is not in charge of this area and that the manager is unfortunately out at the moment. If it was not sad it would be funny. (Service fail all over)

Anyway, I was  writing to Customer relation straight from the airport as I had couple of hours to spare, waiting for my flights paying for my lunch and hoping that somenone from Iberia ground operators would be at the gate this time. I lost a full day because of wrong gate number provided by Iberia airlines.

never received any reply from them or explanation or apology or compensation (remember I asked only for a voucher for meal and a bottle of water )"

Now, I realize that things happen (and if there's a problem, I would much rather have it dealt with on the ground rather than in the air!) but, honestly, the customer service people acted like they had never had a cancellation before. No information was given other than 'Stand here' or 'Wait here.'  There was not a word of apology (rather, they acted like it was our fault for wanting help), nothing was offered in the way of water, food, or even vouchers for same. American Airlines (my ticket was booked through them) put me on the same nonstop flight for the next day but others weren't so lucky and ended up with layovers in Miami, London, New York, or Mexico City.  I still waited at the airport for over SEVEN hours (with only the floor available if I wanted/needed to sit down) because I was told that, if I didn't apply that day, I would forfeit any hope of compensation. I finally made my own hotel reservation (because I didn't for a moment trust Iberia to help) but still had to wait all that time for someone to TEAR A FORM OFF A PAD and hand it to me. We had been told we had wait was because it was necessary for them to input information into the computer but apparently not.

Basically, the Iberia staff acted like they had no idea how to handle the situation - AND THEY DIDN'T CARE.

I love Spain, I have visited many times, and I will continue to visit. But I will NEVER fly Iberia again, if I can help it.

That said, the flight attendants (once I was actually on the plane the next day) were lovely and helpful and very nice.  But heaven help you if your flight gets cancelled."

It was showing as late on the board and was then cancelled due to 'technical problems'.  We waited patiently for Spanish speaking travellers to get information, we asked ground staff if they could tell us what was happening in English, on said 'yes, I'm busy now' and walked away.  Desk staff huddled, away from the desk so we couldn't get them either.  We relied on English speaking Spanish travellers to tell us what was going on.  Iberia ground staff were telling travellers to go from one 'customer service' desk to another, gradually moving us through the airport to a public bar where we had to wait...for a bus.  It took over 5 hours for what was a scheduled flight of about an hour.  No food or water on board the bus, we did stop but refreshments were at your own expense.  No one from Iberia to meet us at Alicante airport, and when we asked how to make a compensation claim no one seemed to know how to respond, other than it was someone else's job.

It seemed that there was a passenger, who was ill.

Also there was very little space for your legs, you could hardly move and there was no net, where you could place a few items.
So it was just disappointing. 

We flew with Norwegian on our way back to Copenhagen, and it was just 10 times better: Super nice staff, very informative (and most of the flight the info was given in 3 languages and with a very clear pronunciation), food/drink trolley came by at least 3 times even though the plane was also very full, and since we were a little late, they also helped the passengers, who were transferring to other flights in Copenhagen, leave the plane quickly.
There was more legroom and a net for your things. 

As a last comment there was also the issue with our hand luggage. So there is a general problem with airlines giving travelers the opportunity to bring a small trolley as hand luggage and not needing to check it in. But at the same time, they don't have the necessary space for all these trolleys. Iberia basically begged us to check in the hand luggage because the plane was full, so my friend checked in hers. With Norwegian we were asked if we wanted to (so it seemed like a service), but it wasn't necessary, and it wasn't a problem on board.
 
So it's just all the small things. I know how crazy the competition is with airlines, and when you choose low-cost, you often get what you pay for. But there is still a big difference between these airlines, and I've always been happy with Norwegian. I think it's important that airlines still keep a certain level, and that you have a good experience when flying. You need a smile, some legspace and a minimum of service. I have better service with Norwegian on 1 hour flights to Berlin than I had on this 3hour+ trip with Iberia to Madrid."

Anyway, we were going to miss our connecting flight in Madrid to Dubrovnik and asked the gate employee what to do.  She said, “Don’t worry, when you get off the plane, someone from Iberia will be there with an envelope containing y our new itinerary.”  Never happened.  In fact, we got to Madrid, waited in a customer service line for about 1 hour and were told we needed to go to a ticket counter.  So, off we went to a ticket counter who re-booked us from Madrid to London and London to Dubrovnik but the on the following day.  Not acceptable...She found a flight from Madrid to Venice and Venice to Dubrovnik.  First leg on Iberia, Last on Austrian Airlines (so she told us).

The flight from Madrid to Venice was the most awful flight I’ve ever been on.  100% full, seats were so close to ones in front that my knees were actually indented for hours after the flight.  Attendants didn’t serve refreshments or snacks.  And, they were pretty nasty.

However when economy class was asked to board there was no organisation of the queue and people got confused as to what line they had to join as 3 lines for Economy formed.

Even after all that chaos suddenly we were told to move to another gate so a stampede took place at the airport and even then we had to wait another hour before boarding took place so therefore the flight got delayed.

Food was ok: the main dish was really tasty, I had chicken with vegetables, but sides and dessert were not as good. Wine was nice. Breakfast I thought was quite ok - croque monsieur (really nice), Greek yogurt, juices (this time -  nectar) bread (cold and hard and offered twice), Kit Kat (yes, Kit Kat), oats cookies...the only let down was the juices :( I don't like sugary juices.
The service on this flight was away much better than my previous one. The crew was helpful and pleasant. The cabin manager was fantastic, she helped me to overcome my fears during a strong turbulence (well, maybe strong for my taste LOL). After she came to see me and offered me support I even managed to sleep for a few hours! I am very thankful to her! 
An overall a great experience. My only suggestion would be to allow premium economy passagers to use the same toilets that business class use, as it is right in front of the area.

• Did not delay flights when there wasn't enough time for a connection.

Due to Delta leaving 3.5 hours late I missed my connection in Paris and as all the Delta Partner flights were booked going down to Madrid that evening they put me on an Iberia flight.  This gave me a 4 hour layover or so in Paris so you would think my luggage would have arrived.  It didn't.  I figured it would show up a day or so later because how do you lose luggage for longer than that and I made the mistake of only making only one pair of underclothes and two shirts in my backpack.  As the days progressed with no luggage I was told by Iberia to hold onto my receipts for reimbursement as I had to by clothes I could wear for my conference, makeup and some clothes for the vacation portion of my trip.  I didn't go wild.  Finally, on the 9th day of no luggage they contacted me to say it was found and now in Madrid.  That didn't help as I was in Barcelona.  I instructed them to send it to my home in Utah to which they told me they would send me the shipping information.  They never did.  Three days later there was a knock at my door at 4:50 a.m. that freaked me out because I wasn't expecting anyone.  It ended up being my luggage.  Luckily, it was all there.  Unfortunately, the story doesn't end there.  When the Iberia representative told me to hang onto my receipts he gave me an email address to send all my documentation.  I did so knowing that reimbursement could take up to 30 days.  After 3 weeks of radio silence from Iberia I contacted them to check the status and they said they never received my paperwork!  They gave me a new email address and I resubmitted again. This time I saw emails from them saying they were processing and I could expect a check in approximately 30 days.  Fast forward to this week.  At day 36 I called them and was told that they couldn't help me.  That I would need to lodge a complaint through their website.  I immediately did and received an email that said it could take up to 21 days to respond.  When I got home that day there was a check in the mail for less than half of the amount submitted!!!  I've since contacted them without response.  The customer service of this airline is unbelievably horrible!  Do not ever fly with or recommend them (unless you really hate the person).  =)  I book a lot of travel for the software company I work with and will never direct any business their way.

But our experience on Iberia should be a warning to other fellow travelers who may consider their services. 
We had a flight from JFK to Toulouse with the connection in Madrid. This was a start of our holiday exploring the beautiful South-Western France.
Our connection in Madrid was very short - only 1 hr and 15 min. In the retrospect I understand that they should not have sold us this ticket - the travel time between the terminals - as marked by the signs - was 28 minutes already!
No gate agent was available at the arrival to navigate us through and help us find the easiest route to our gate. Also other airlines helped their connecting customers to pass through the passport control faster - but Iberia agents were not to be found. To make long story short, we arrived at our connecting flight sweating and panting - we run the whole way - just when the plane was pushed off (no one wanted to give us 2 minutes grace either). 
And then came the insult. When we got to speak to a customer service agent at the terminal, she told us that we had plenty of time to get to our gate and it was all our fault that we missed our connection. none of our explanations - or our sweaty faces - mattered. Following that she mentioned that she does not have to do anything for us as our missing the flight was due to our negligence. She gave us seats on the last flight of the day and made it look like she was doing us a great favor. The attitude was really unbelievable!
Instead of enjoying our first day of vacation in France, we spend it in Madrid airport. Mind you in US we do not have very long vacations in general. It did hurt.
The final bit of irony was that, when we arrived in Toulouse we found our bags not on a belt but in  a segregated area. They flew our bags on our original flight without us being on the plane which is a violation of the aviation rules.

We were in complete shock and disbelief when we walked in the plane and saw that all the seats in both business class and economy were exactly the same size, our business class seats weren’t any wider and didn’t recline more than economy seats, so we got ripped off paying more than double.

The only con I had to flying Iberia is that they do not seat you together or anywhere near others in your party - especially if you all booked together on the same ticket/credit card. There were 3 of us travelling together and we booked our flights altogether, but we sat no where near one another. We were all adults so we just dealt with it, but there were SEVERAL families on our return flight with small children that Iberia booked them in seats all over the aircraft. How can you allow a small child to sit by itself on an international flight and not with their guardians/parents?! Our flight was delayed leaving Madrid (our layover stop) back to JFK because so many people were bartering with one another to switch seats so their children could sit with them. It was very disappointing to see this. The gate agents would also not move people around prior to boarding as the general excuse was, """"this is a full flight"""".. my opinion too bad families, especially with small children, should all be allowed to sit together."

Not that you can't talk on a plane, but it was louder than other flights so much so that it was noticeable. Like non-stop talking the entire time. The other thing that happened on both flights were there were large groups of teens flying together and they did not sit down/sit still/ sit frontwards/ move when people tried to pass in the aisles and no one, especially the flight crew, seemed to care. On both flights they were definitely just acting like typical teens who didn't have any supervision, but it was disruptive to other passengers, and no one said anything."

Most of my travel there, I try to take a direct flight which basically limits me to Iberia (American airlines uses Iberia to travel to Madrid).  I use to love Iberia... the food was excellent, the wine was great, the bread was fresh and always had second servings.  As the years have gone by... I have noticed this airline has just become average.  My recent travel to and from Spain was nothing to really write home about.  The food was average, the bread seemed old, the wine was okay.  But this could all be accepted except now I notice the bathrooms are just horrendous.  The bathrooms smelled like urine!  I had two children with me and hated having to go to the bathroom with them.  I accetes it as a mistake when we went to Spain, but to have the same thing occur on our way back just was awful.  
Some positives:  the crew was wonderful.  Very polite, brought the food for the girls first, and even held the food for us when they were sleeping.  They had smiles and seemed to enjoy their job. 

Unfortunately  I feel that Iberia is not to worried about customer service or improving their airline as other companies do.  It just seems to be worse and worse throughout the years.

Once we got to the airport, the line at the counter was ridiculous, so we assumed that we would be able to change our seats with the gate agent, as that's what we were told we could do.  Not so.  There was only one gate, and no gate agent until the flight was about to board, so we had to go back out to the counter, which was another long wait.  We also needed a preboard as we were traveling with my husbands parents, and they just told us they really don't have a formal one, but to stand in a certain spot and they would let us on.  When it was time to board, we had to fight for our """"spot"""", and once we finally got through, we had to wait for a very late flight crew.  The wheelchair assistance team told us that they are always late.  We found this to be true our entire trip.  The flight itself was okay, the seats are very tight, so if you can, definitely upgrade to business class, but that is limited.  My only other complaint was that I am allergic to aspartame, and my husband is allergic to pork, so needless to say, I really couldn't consume any of the beverages on the flight, and my husband was given a sandwich that had pork on it, and was told it was not.

In a few days, it will be the one year anniversary of our dads passing. The five of us decided to go on a vacation to be together to honor our dad. His family was everything to him. He was our """"rock"""". A true saint on this earth and we miss him terribly. 
There are actually other reasons we felt we should do this; some of us have health issues and others-personal issues, that we felt we needed to be together in support and love. 
As I mentioned, our holiday was just what we could have hoped for. We are all still very close and love each other very much, even after all these years!! I'm the youngest and I celebrated my birthday of 59 years yesterday!
We all decided we would pay $130.00 US extra to upgrade to premium seating on the long flight from Madrid to NYC...a big splurge for all of us, but we figured, what the heck! An email came through with this special offer a week before the flight and we all agreed to """"go for it"""". We will all be together and dad would want us to feel special. 
Fast forward to today and the first """"red flag"""". We never received a confirmation email from Iberia Airlines confirming our flight and allowing us to check in online. We arrived at the Zagreb airport 3 hours early to make sure everything was in order. Second red flag, for some """"odd reason"""", none of our boarding passes would print out on our second leg from Madrid to NYC. We were told by the ticket agent, """"not to worry"""". They could print our boarding passes when we arrived in Madrid. From here, things seriously took a turn for the worse. We had less than 45 minutes to get from our arrival gate to our connecting gate, which was in a totally different terminal! There was no way we would have made it on our own so we were put on a shuttle, along with 14 other passengers that were on the same flight. 
They rushed us through so quickly, we didn't have a clue what was going on...until we got on the plane, where they told us, """"Oh, so sorry. This is a different aircraft and three of you are in the back in economy"""". Are you kidding me? Just like that? I feel we probably got bumped to economy seating because someone else paid more money and/or we were late getting on the plane, through no fault of our own. 
Ok. So maybe I sound like a whiney baby but this was a really big deal for all of us to be together...one of our dads last wishes as he passed. 
I think the worst part about it was the lack of care and concern from the crew. They truly didn't care and told us to go to customer service at Iberian Airlines when we landed in NYC to deal with it. Yeah right. Just what I want to do after flying and traveling for 16 hours, with a 2 1/2 hour drive home from the airport.  It would have been nice if they even acknowledged what had happened but instead, ignored the three of us in economy. 
This review is so long because I obviously have a lot of time on my hands (a 6 1/2 hour flight), of which I am trying desperately to deep breathe and """"let it go"""". I have to admit, this is helping to get it off my chest!
I would give this airline a rating of ZERO, if that was possible. 
I was actually warned about their customer service prior to booking the flight and read other reviews, which were horrible. I took a risk. I shouldn't have. If you're smart, you'll heed my advice. I strongly suggest you book on another airline."

The first issues was checked luggage.  Tried to add 1 piece in the hold from Canada, not allowed.  The travel agent tried too, not allowed.  So to the gate at Heathrow to pay 110 dollars Canadian to check one piece of luggage.  Not allowed by the BA software either. Finally they go it on after a very long time, a very skilled supervisor and waved the charges.

Onto the gate.  If you have been through Heathrow, you know it is a zoo at the best of times.  So the gate announcement is purposely withheld until 10 minutes before boarding!  A mad rush when it is posted.  But wait, there is more.  Iberia declared a full flight and forced the the low ticket class to check the hand luggage.  Guess what?  The Iberia program would not accept and luggage for the hold.  So Mr BIG threatened no check hand luggage no fly.  So he erased the one piece in the hold to put both in the hold.  He said he erased the piece in the hold, then said he could not put anything in so just go ahead with my hand luggage.  The flight did not seem full to me.  Five empty seats. 

Guess what? No luggage in the hold on arrival -- it really was erased.

Iberia has no time or day to delivery, just stay at hotel and wait for them. Nothing.  Back to the airport five days later.  They have it, smashed beyond repair.  So make another internet claim and wait for the delivery to deliver a suitcase.  Gave them a local number and asked to text before delivery.  They must know that I have no access to internet except in the city so they emailed  me twice, that delivery would occur sometime.  In Spanish.  So four days later they give ME a phone number to call.  

Iberia has a system that works for them, not me, and requires me to sit and wait all day to serve them instead of be out and enjoy my holiday, which cost a lot per day.  If they deliver.  A Pox on their house.  And now I will have to replace the suitcase out of my own money."

Long story short.. one of my suitcases was opened. Shoes, handbags and a watch was stolen. Upon arrival to my destination (Valencia) I realized my bag was opened so I made a claim. The airline asked me to provide receipts of the things that were stolen.. how ridiculous is that! As I did not have receipts, they told me to buy the things that were missing from my bag and to provide receipts,so they could reimburse me. So I went ahead and did that. Now it's been over 6 months and Iberia hasn't give a coin! Every time I call them to check on the progress of my claim they say they are about to pay me but there has been a delay as they are migrating to a new software. Not a single email apologizing or a phone call. No sense of customer service whatsoever. I feel like I've been robbed twice.

After landing in Las Palmas at around 02:00AM, the passenger was removed from the plane almost immediately to receive appropriate care. Meanwhile, the rest of us were onboard the plane for approximately 2 hours due to refuelling of the plane. We were notified there was a problem with the refuelling system and that they were trying to fix this. At 04:00AM we had to leave the aircraft and enter the airport, collect our baggage and only 2-3 members of staff were present. I had no idea what was happening as no-one was speaking english; it was just a very unorganised situation that seemed like no-one knew what was happening. There was at least 4.5 hours of waiting until eventually at 08:30am we were taken to a hotel, where we were still unclear about when the plane would depart. At the hotel, I had to constantly linger around reception to ask for any news...then finally after lunchtime we were taken back to the airport to board our flight. This resulted into my arrival in Buenos Aires approximately 18.5 hours late. I had to re-organise my airport transfers and was almost at risk of missing the first day of my tour. I also lost out on my only free day in Buenos Aires. Many of us filled out a pink complaint form at Gran Canaria, Las Palmas and Iberia sent an email on the 14th April 2018 to say they would respond to my complaint within 21 business days. It has been 106 business days with still no response from Iberia. I required written confirmation from Iberia Airlines to state why there was a delay for insurance purposes. I tried to contact them in June but they don't have a general email for enquiries, only an email specifically for Iberia Plus customers. Even if you try and email the Iberia Plus team, you simply receive an automated response asking for your Iberia Plus number. I tried to call the customer service number and the person answering was quite rude and unhelpful. He told me to go to website and lodge it as a new complaint, but there seemed to be some problem with the actual website because I couldn't actually file the complaint. When I tried to select Madrid as the origin airport, it just would not let me onto the next page. Overall, a very disappointing experience with their customer service and ultimately I was so frustrated I just gave up."

We had purchased non-refundable Premium Economy seats totaling $1897.82 for 2 adults.  The change fees are $275 per person plus any fare difference. 

After Iberia made it clear they would not refund us, I tried on several occasions to change our flights online to a later date (and pay the $550 change fee--$275 x 2--and any difference in price) only to discover that Iberia is rife with deception and unethical pricing practices:
1.  I found that Iberia has two sets of prices:
     a.  the lowest fares are available only online to customers and NOT to Iberia Telesales staff.
     b.  Only MUCH higher prices are available to their Telesales employees.  The lie
          and deception is that Iberia tells the public, on their web site, that Telesales Staff have access to the """"best fares"""".  The complete opposite is true.  Their Telesales staff do not have access to the lower, online, fares.  
     2.  When I tried to change my flights online (and pay the $550 penalty for 2 adults) I realized that we were about to be charged prices consistent with Premium Economy seating but we were being forced into Economy class even though Premium seats were available!  I confirmed this lockout with Telesales who told me that if I want to rebook again with Premium Economy seating, that can only be done with the Telesales team.  And if you re-read point 1 above ... that means that the price I got from Telesales was higher than what's available online as a new purchase.  The price I got from Telesales to change our flights is $3,300 when those same dates and flights and seats are available as a new purchase for $1867.  Mind you, that $1867, would be offset by a credit for the similarly priced tickets we already paid for, and that would work out to be a wash.  We should only have to pay the $550 change fee.  Not $3,300.  

As I processed all this and tried to understand why this chaos was occurring, I ended up spending over 3 hours on the phone with Iberia Telesales reps over the last few days.  Sent them numerous emails. 

Finally, their Telesales staff told me they read my emails and that given my wife's medical condition and the frustrations of the last few days I just needed to take the medical proof (Surgeon's letter, etc.) to the Iberia counter at JFK Airport and the counter agents there would give us a full refund. 

You can see where this is going, right?  The counter agents at JFK today were besides themselves not understanding why Telesales would tell us something that was untrue: Counter agents at JFK cannot give refunds.  We were right back where we started.  

We are now 2 days from departure date and face the possibility of losing almost $1900 and not being able to use that $1900 to rebook with Iberia due to their unethical pricing system.  

I've contacted VISA to dispute my charge with Iberia and I've informed Iberia I will begin publicizing their despicable practices on the Internet.  I'm now demanding a refund from them.  If they don't comply, I will take them to Small Claims Court.  

If you have any advice for me, please offer it.  Thank you and I strongly recommend you look for another airline."

What annoyed me though was on the return flight home, just before boarding the plane, the stewardess stopped me, gave me a label to put on my cabin bag and told me to send it down the chute to add to the hold luggage as """"there wasn't enough room"""" in the overhead lockers.  This was total nonsense as there was plenty of room.  The group who were in front of me took their bags on, and the group after me did too, so I'm presuming that there's a selection of passengers who book early, get good rates and are penalised for doing so.

Now that I got that out of the way, here is why: My girlfriend and I took Iberia from Barcelona to Madrid. The flight was expected to depart around 9:30 and arrive in Madrid an hour and a half or so later. After waiting in line to board with the plane at the gate and about 20 minutes past boarding time, we were told there is a problem and that the flight has been cancelled. We get it, things happen. Although any sort of heads up would have been nice. So, we run to customer service, wait in line for an hour and get onto a flight at 6pm, 8 hours later! Our 2 day trip in Madrid was looking a lot like a 1 day trip now. We go get our bags afterwards, which we wait in an additional line for over an hour to find out we were told to wait in the wrong line. When we finally get our luggage, we go back to check it in and get our voucher for a whole $13 for lunch even though we would be spending lunch and dinner in the airport. The only thing keeping us going with an Iberia flight was the customer service letting us know that we would receive a refund for the tickets once we file our case. One month later and our request for a refund was denied! We waited 8 hours in the airport, cut our trip in half, and are expected to do all of that for free, let alone the stress and frustration it caused. This was by far the worst experience with an airline. We are still dealing with the company to get our refund, but this is completely unacceptable and I urge you all to fly on any other airline. I found out afterwards from a friend that she had a similar experience with Iberia where she was stuck at an airport for 6 hours. I wish I knew beforehand as I would have flew on another airline."

Agents at American said that Iberia never paid for her ticket, Iberia said that it was AA problem... and that if she wanted to fly on that flight she had to buy a new ticket that cost $3,000 in that moment.
Long story short: after arguing with Iberia, thru Expedia support after 4 long hours ( Iberia also wanted to blame the passenger saying that her ticket was lost because she didn't check in on time the day before when her original flight scheduled, which was a huge lie . So after 4 long hours she finally was located in a flight to Madrid on that afternoon .

Our flight was scheduled from Barcelona to Madrid so we can get our connecting flight to LA. Our flight never showed up, so another plan took us 2 1/2 hours later to Madrid. No explanation.  Missed Flight to LA. They did put us up in a hotel, however the customer service on letting us know anything and the flight attendants have a rude attitude and rarely came around for trash on a 9.5 hour flight, (you can imagine)."

Usually, the flight merits no comment as the service is ho hum.  The service on August 6, however, was particularly negative.  While the beverages served are fine, the food is usually sub par for business class.  But the flight attendants in this particular flight really merits a negative comment.  They were rude, brusque and apparently had personal problems between them.  Iberia, if you're reading this, take note of the August 6 crew serving business class.  Really a nasty bunch."

Needless to say that me and my family will rather spend 3 times more if needed just to avoid traveling with Iberia again, the worst company I’ve traveled with no doubt, I’ve traveled over more than 65 country’s , I think it says a lot about the company."

Flew Iberia in spring 2018 to Madrid as group of 4 (2 couples). Bad start as boarding passes for all 4 of us were for seats that didn't actually exist on the aircraft. Actually went thru gate scan of boarding passes and got on plane to find seats didn't exist (and we had paid extra for seat assignments. Head flight attendant gave us equivalent seats, so not a big deal. 

But then things got exponentially worse. On arrival in Madrid, only my checked bag made it. Stood in line for over an hour to file claim for missing bags. Pleasant agents, that were not in the slightest hurry. Opened claims for the missing bags, and agent said web site would give us status updates. Web site completely useless; just said """"Tracing continues"""" for next 5 days. Tried many times calling Iberia baggage service. About 20% of the time, phone line would disconnect in the phone tree or while on hold. Another common occurrence was line would get answered by Iberia+ customer support, who clearly was uninterested in helping a non Iberia+ customer. Once even got agent that said could not help us, could take 2 weeks to find the bags, and just hung up. When did get to agent that would at least look for updates, got nothing more than the web site status. 

American Airlines flew the first leg of our trip to Spain (SFO to LAX), so tried their baggage service number. AA was exceptionally helpful, checking the baggage scans and determining that the bags were scanned by AA in SFO and LAX, and then by Iberia in LAX before disappearing. They also explained the process for what happens to bags that haven't reached their owners (after 3 days they are accumulated in central location where a group works to reunite with their owner; after 21 days, they are considered lost forever).

Late on the 4th night without the bags, a call to Iberia got the same no new status response. With a call to AA though, was told the bags had been found and were actually on a flight to our next destination (Lisbon). Couple hours later, got a text from Iberia stating the same. On 5th day, we were finally reunited with our bags.

Unfortunately, Iberia was not yet done with us, however. After 2 days with only the clothes and sandals she was wearing on the airplane, my wife broke down and bought a change of clothes, pair of shoes, toiletries, and a jacket. We filed a claim with Iberia for reimbursement. First, it is hard just to figure out how to file a claim. Madrid baggage agents gave us a web site link to use. The link is inactive. Searching Iberia.com web site, must go to Contacts link, then thru a side menu, and then to a  Complaints link to file a claim. The claim can only have 3 attachments and under 5MB. Had to do multiple scans of the receipts and other docs they wanted to manage to squeeze into these requirements. 

About 4 weeks later, they started asking for more info. I provided everything they wanted, and followed up with a call a few days later.. Each time, they stated they never received any response from me, sometimes giving a variety of possible reasons (e.g. attachments must have been too big, server down at the time, I must just reply to their email rather than copy their email address to To field, something wrong with my email address, among others). With the dozens of times I have sent replies to them in multiple ways and using a different email address, none of their reasons are valid. They also refuse to let me speak with a manager, saying they have no way to transfer the call. The email address they provide for escalation gets no response. I am still in this fight; no idea how many months it will take to actually get them to reimburse our expenses.

In the bottom line, Iberia customer service is absolutely horrendous. We will never fly this airline again. Hopefully, we are influencing many friends and anyone reading this review to do same."

The flight attendants were very nice and mostly left us alone except for food/drink service.

As we were put on a connecting flight two hours later, no compensation was due. A bag again did not arrive

We did complain to both Iberia and the CAA - both were useless and didn't want to know. You have been warned.

I couldn’t fly via Virgin on this trip, as annoyingly they do not fly to Havana at weekends, so I had to pay about £100 more to fly via Madrid with Iberia.
The booking process (online) was OK, but the they going back to select seats and meals was a nightmare, in fact selecting meal preferences proved impossible and at the airport the check in staff would not allow us to select vegetarian meals. 
Iberia’s proud boast is that they are the most punctual airline on the world, but the6 are not. They are obsessed with getting off early, which is probably worse than being a bit late, as you are hassled and hurried, even if you are on time. 
The first let of the trip to Madrid was on the hottest, most cramped aircraft possible and would have put Ryanair to shame!
The connection in Madrid was fine and easy.
The aircraft Airbus A330-300 was really nice and the seats more comfortable than Virgin’s Boeing 777.
In flight entertainment, was not as comprehensive as virgin, but still good, with plenty of Morden and classic films, TV shows, music etc.
Food, this was shockingly bad, spam and cold pasta bad, even the brad rolls were cheap and nasty. You would only eat these offerings if you were really hungry.
Drinks - rationed and spilt!
The worst aspect of Iberia is there cabin crew, who are spectacularly rude; like grudging, scruffy, untrained, waiters who had been forced to work a double shift.

The story goes like this: Initially I booked a flight with Vueling and after a few days they informed me about the change of departure time ofering me the possibility to cancel the flight and receive a refund.
I checked available flights and I found the flight with Iberia that with an extra 10 euro gave me the same depature time Vuelling changed (nowhere was specified that the flight would be not operated by Iberia!)
So I cancelled with Vueling and receiving the money back I booked with Iberia.
On the departure day, arriving at the airport, I see on the display that the departure time changed. I go to an Iberia check-in desk and the lady tells me the departure time is the one I booked. She wasn't even aware that the time changed!!! I had to convince her that the display shows another time. After a call made to a colleague she declared that yes, the time changed. Like (I did not know this!) It was an almost 3h delay from the initial time booked.
So I send a complaint to Iberia. But the answer was they are not responsible because the flight was operated by Vueling. Really?
I am sure Vueling was very correct with me. The company I payed to is Iberia not Vueling. So I am expecting the responsability to be taked by Iberia.

Now, my question is: why a company would sell a service delivered by a third party, applaying an extra charge, not being aware of any change of the service and refusing any responsability!
The only thing I asked for in my complaint is to receive the 10 euro difference, not the whole amount of money. Because I received a service, right? But I did not receive the service I payed for. And Vueling deserves to be payed because it operated the flight. But Iberia doesn't deserve any money (the 10 euro difference) because it did not offer me any service - worst, it confused me with the wrong schedule, messing out my plans.
Lack of responsability says a lot about a company.

When I got to the airport 3 hour early, I was not allowed to check-in as I could not present the credit card I had paid the ticket with. My card expired last month and since I had already paid for the ticket and  got rid off the old card as recommended by any bank. In addition, I never had any issues with my credit card and travelled with this card across the globe never having any problems.

The man working at the ticket office at Iberia at Madrid airport was extremely rude and really did not give a damn about helping me:
•	I presented my email ticket showing proof of my purchase with my name on it. That was not enough.
•	I presented to him a photo proof of my credit card proving that the card was indeed mine which he did not accept.
•	I showed him the credit card bill with the Iberia charge showing that I HAD PAID FOR THE TICKET and there was not fraud.
•	He told me that I could not get on the plane and he would not even let me cancel my existing reservation and pay for the same seat on the same plane again. 
•	I was told that the Iberia flights during the next two days were fully booked up so that he could not even make me another reservation for me on another day.   I went online to see if that was true and there were seats available on both days. 
•	He told me that Iberia and Iberia Plus are two different companies! and that he could not help me since part of my ticket was paid with my miles. He said he had nothing to do with my ticket reservation and gave me the phone number of Iberia miles so that they could fix the problem. He would not even call on my behalf to Iberia Plus given that I am not a native Spanish speaker
•	At Iberia Plus on the phone I was repeatedly told that they could not verify my card. (even though they had proof that I had paid with this card on previous Iberia flights)
When I asked for reimbursement for my miles (I had paid a large part of this flight with my miles) I was told that the miles could not be reimbursed EVEN THOUGH I HAD NOT USED them and it was them who denied me access to the plane.
This is customer service at its worst.  I particularly would like to point to the extremely rude man working at the Iberia ticket office that did not have any intention of helping or reimbursing me. In addition, it is embarrassing that Iberia would not even reimburse my miles I had not used.

Note that we were not aware of this as no notification was given to us.The captain did not speak once, except when referring to the crew. This again would not have been a problem but the fact that the flight attendants were rude and slow and the plane was dirty added to the situation.

The flight to Barcelona, unlike our return flight, was not completely terrible. Pros: we departed and arrived on time, our bags arrived intact, and the entertainment options onboard were great. The WiFi was mediocre, but that’s pretty common on most international flights. Cons: the flight attendants were hands down the rudest I have ever encountered, particularly a middle aged woman woman w short blonde hair. So nasty. Add to the rudeness the fact that this is the only airline I have ever encountered that does not even provide you with one glass of water on a 12 hour flight unless you request it AND pay $5 for it.  
The return flight was a complete disaster. The only Pro was that we arrived alive and didn’t have to deal with the demon flight attendant this time (though she was still on the plane and there were plenty of rude younger ones to make up for her lack of attention).
The Cons were innumerable. We arrived at the airport in Barcelona almost three hours before our departure time.  We were unable to complete our check in online due to a computer error. We had a bag to check anyway, so we figured we’d just do it at the airport. However, when we arrived, the check in line was already incredibly long and just got longer after our arrival. The line moved unbelievably slow. No one knew why. There were 5 attendants checking people in - all of them for our flight. They were each taking an average of 10 minutes to check in each party. After an hour of this and having hardly moved in the line, I went to front to find out WHAT was going on and if we were going to make the flight. Found out that the computer error was universal and that no one could check in online. But the fact that this was not communicated to any of us in line made for a very tense situation. I was later told by another passenger in line that an attendant had told her they would hold the flight until everyone had checked in and gotten on board. But they never changed the flight departure time, and as it got increasingly closer to departure time, we all grew more and more worried. Add to this that the airport had no air conditioning and that it was the first week of August, and you start to get the idea of what this was like. 
After over 2.5 hours in line, we finally got checked in. The attendant told us that she hoped we made the flight, but to run, because it was departing in 10 minutes. And we still needed to get through security. So we ran. No time to stop and buy food for the ensuing 13 hour flight with no free snacks or water. No time to stop and hit the restroom. Just run. At the gate? “We are trying to hold the flight for you. Please hurry.”  Once through, then wait in an shuttle bus with no AC and 40 sweating passengers to take you to another terminal to the plane. Rushed and pushed by employees and still left an hour late. Once on board, rude attendants unwilling to help with finding carryon space. A total nightmare. 
Then there’s the flight: no WiFi. Completely broken. Freezing cold airplane, even w two sweatshirts on, but you could buy a $15 blanket if you wanted!  Broken food ordering system. No one to collect trash. Literally. Then yelled at for leaving it on the floor. And to top it all off - they lost our luggage. Not just ours, but the last 30-40 people to board the plane.

And then at the boarding gate one of their staff came to me just a minute before closing the gate and said that we found u one other seat only for 4 can go and one has to stay in Seville, I told her again we r one family and one booking and we have a connection to amman from Madrid and I can’t send my wife with the kids alone so she tells me well then sorry we will off load your luggage and it’s not our responsibility !!! She was basically threatening me to induce me to send the family alone. I told her this is not right we have confirmed booking and u told me that Iberia overbooked the flight. She confirmed again that yes Iberia did over book the flight and that this is their right and they r not responsible for me if I decided not to send my family alone and that she doesn’t even know when I can leave and follow them. Accordingly I told her I know my rights and anyhow I just can’t send kids alone on such a long trip with connection as well in a big airport which they don’t know.

Our journey began with our flight from Barbados to London Gatwick on BA connection to Ibiza on BA and then the last leg on Iberia.  2 bags and a golf bag tagged all the way.  Golf bag made it but our 2 bags didn't.  It did not bode well to see at least 10 people at the IB lost luggage kiosk at ALC in front of us.  We filled out the report, we were given a copy of the report and the tracking details.  This was 02 August after travelling for 24 hours with layovers.  03 August checked online to see one bag was being sent to land in ALC at 9.30 a.m. and the second bag being sent on a late evening flight.  Tried to call the lost luggage number we were given all day 03 August to see if we could go and collect the first bag - no answer on each occasion.  Tried various numbers that we found online, emailed BA (as our flight was originally BA and booked via AA air miles) - no answer all day on any number and up to now no response from BA email sent.  Finally got through at one of the numbers and the agent could not verify that the first bag had in fact arrived at ALC.  The morning of 04 August checked again online and second bag had arrived and the status was updated that the bags were located and were being prepared for delivery.  Again about 20 attempts throughout the day to contact the airline to see if we could go and collect the bags with no luck.  Husband tried contacted Iberia via FaceBook and did get an initial response but then nothing.  Around 5 p.m. we finally got through to be told that the bags were being delivered but not until 10 or 11 p.m.  I asked the agent why the bags were being delivered so late and why no-one had bothered to contact us to update us - she told me that all bags going to Murcia (where we are staying) are delivered late in the evening.  I told her that we were not given that information at the airport and if someone had called us we would have driven the hour drive to go and collect.  She said there was nothing they could do as the bags had left the airport - she was indifferent and not very sympathetic to say the least.  Around 10.30 p.m. I called again and managed to get through and was now told the bags would not get to us until 1 or 2 a.m.  What a ridiculous time to be delivering bags to clients!   We are livid - we came to Murcia to play golf, meet up with friends who had flown over from the UK, to be stuck in a villa, unable to go anywhere because we have to wait for the delivery of our bags.  Not ONE phone call from the airport agent and to get through to them just about impossible.  While the last agent I spoke with - Libia - was very apologetic and sympathetic and while I lay no blame with her, the total lack of communication by the airport agents in the last two days and to have our bags in the delivery van all this time is unacceptable and the airport office closed at 11 p.m. so if the bags don't arrive as promised we have no one to answer our calls.  This is not the way to start a long awaited vacation - badly handled from the start.  Would I travel with Iberia again?  NO, NO and NO."

8.16335487365723,4.814781665802,"Iberia Flight Delays",1,"Our family (two teenagers) flew out of Madrid this morning after a wonderful couple of weeks in Spain.  We have flown dozens of times as a family and I've flown many more times for business and today's experience was the worst any of us have ever experienced, as described below:
1.  Iberia's on-line check in only worked for three of us, with no explanation for why my teen-aged son couldn't be checked in online;
2.  We got to the airport 2.5 hours before the flight departed and spent 1:20 in line to get to the check-in desk.  This was due to the fact that Iberia had staffed only 4 people to check in all three of their departing international flights to the US that morning.  It is almost certain that several people missed flights due to Iberia's failure to adequately staff its check-in desks.
3.  When we got to the check-in we were told that my teen-aged son was on """"standby"""" and did not have a seat because """"the flight is overbooked.""""  This was difficult to believe, as we had booked 5 months earlier and it's impossible to believe that an airline would pick one minor from a family to deny boarding.  The gate agent evidenced an appalling lack of interest in this issue and just told us to """"go to the gate and maybe they can find a seat if someone doesn't show up.""""  He also said """"this happens all the time, especially in the summer.""""  Accordingly, it appears that Iberia grossly overbooks as a matter of practice.  This is obviously a completely unacceptable response, and he even refused to just let us buy and upgrade to business or first class to ensure a seat.  Again, it's difficult to put into words how completely disinterested and dismissive this guy was for what was a very difficult position his company had put us in.  
4.  When we got to the gate we were told that the gate agent had lied to us - our son wasn't without a seat, but had just been randomly selected for additional security.  This is fine, although Iberia shouldn't lie to a family and tell them that their son isn't going to have a seat on a flight simply because they want to pull him aside for extra screening at the gate.  He had a seat and the flight wasn't full - so either the gate agent completely lied about the flight being overbooked or he and his fellow under-staffed cohorts were so slow that dozens of people missed that flight. 
5.  Madrid airport sets new records for inefficiency and illogical security.  Our passports were checked FOUR TIMES - once at check-in, once at the security checkpoint, once at the train entrance to get to """"Gate S section"""" and again at the gate.  Each checkpoint created a pinch-point and delays.  What on earth do they think the benefit would be of the second, third and fourth passport checks????  If you get in and have your passport checked you're not going to somehow present any greater risk if your passport isn't checked repeatedly again to confirm you're exactly who you were when you were checked the last time.
6,  While it was nice to be home, the Chicago Customs & Immigration desk was severely under-staffed, to the point where the staff were complaining to customers about how long the lines were and one staff member showed me a list of all incoming international flights (around 80, it appeared) and wondered aloud how they could only have about 1/2 of the passport kiosks staffed.  We agreed - there was absolutely no reason for the Customs & Immigration staffing to be so poor.  The net result was that it took 2 hours from touchdown to get to the offsite parking bus.
Spain is a lovely country, and it's unfortunate their name is sullied by any association with Iberia airlines."

This requires a terminal change with a minimum time necessary of about thirty minutes.  The route is well marked, but perhaps a tiny bit confusing because you must go to/follow a green capital S.  My first reaction was that this is the route to the S-trains, a symbol used throughout Germany and Austria.  This change needs to be considered when making reservations.  It worked out for me, as every flight was on-time and the exiting EU passport control was not backed up.  Iberia's web site does not provide a seat map for your flight.  They refer you to seatguru.com which works very well.  Look there to make your seat reservation and you will get excellent info about the seating: leg room, seat reclining?, vicinity to toilets, exits, galleys, etc.   The only negative about my Iberia flights was that in Europe they do not use jet bridges.  Buses bring you out to the plane parked somewhere far out on the tarmac.  This means climbing steep stairs with your carry-on luggage."

Over the course of the flight, I was wondering why I kept seeing passengers walking up to the galley for stuff, until I tried to get something - the call button was triggered for 20 mins before I gave up and did what the rest did to get my water. Apparently the attendant was reading newspaper in the galley. Some 30 mins later, the attendant came to me and asked if I wanted anything since the light was still on (for 50 mins!). I guess the consolation was that she finally """"saw the light"""". 

Lunch was hamburger rice, which is code for (unidentified) meat on rice with tomato sauce. The plus is that they don't seem to skimp on wine - they will give you the small bottles when you ask for them - the challenge is drinking the (poor quality) wine!. Suggest you bring your own snacks for the long flight. Cabin was cold."

When I had this issue going to Italy from Spain, the agents at the airport did not care and just tell you to fill a complaint form.  I was transferred 3 times in 20 minutes making everyone running around just to tell you the flight is delayed an hour.  No one could even get a snack or use the restroom because they kept sending you places.  They do absolutely nothing to help and have serious attitude problems and only help people they feel like helping.  Also, in Madrid, a lady cut in line in front of everyone and spoke Spanish and was able to get assistance with her flight...HELLO, I speak Spanish too and all they said was how rude foreigners were......SERIOUSLY!!!  Then I saw her on my same flight!!! WTH!!!  Also, shame on American Airlines for partnering with this company.  When you try to collect your points, you have to call Spain and they always hang up if you choose English.  They don't listen to you assume the help you need.

I wish I could give this airline 0/5 stars. It all started when I paid for 2 seats near the front knowing full well our layover in Madrid was short. They placed us at the back of the plane, and we nearly missed our flight. Then, we had that layover in Madrid, which took almost an hour and a half to get through customs because there were only 6/14 booths open. Then, on the way home, they lost our bag. I was told that the bag would be in New York within 3 days...2 weeks later our bag showed up, and they had no record of where it was, so we thought it was just lost and they were hanging us out to dry. I filed complaints for both clothes bought while the bag was gone and reimbursement for the seats. They have yet to reimburse either of those, even though its been 22 days since submitting the complaint. Again, there is no record online of what is taking so long. Lastly, customer service, flight attendants, and information kiosk workers were all objectively rude throughout the process.

I think Iberia is now more expensive, but may be worth it.

Business seat configuration on the Airbus A-330 hasve rows of alternatively curved seats (inboard/outboard) in a 1 / 2 / 1 arrangement of which I'm not a particular fan. The two center seats have a low fixed partition between them.

The arrangement affords considerable privacy with little interaction with other passengers, which some people will prize; flat reclining seats of no impressive width and generally cramped in my opinion.

In a nutshell: Food was average; Entertainment was excellent with a host of first-run movie/TV/documentary selections. Service (like Avianca) was highly impersonal. Crew couldn't wait to shove  dinner in front of you without the relaxing opportunity for a cocktail period, then practically ignore you for the rest of the nine-hour flight while they could fraternize in the galley until shoving breakfast in front of you in the morning.

Arrived at the airport 2hours prior, everything went smoothly, we were embarking. When it was my turn the ticket didn’t scan and an employee asked me to step aside. He asked me if I was traveling alone which was the case, then told me my seat was broken and I could only take this flight if someone else didn’t show up, which wasn’t the case.. I couldn’t afford to be late in Madrid but had no choice... they booked me on the next flight and I had to wait 5 more hours at the airport. The employees at the desk were laughing among themselves about the situation , I felt pretty bad. 
I did arrive in Spain 4.5 hours late, we’ll at least I did make it. They immediately gave me a compensation as well as a voucher to get food while waiting at the airport though."

At the tine I haven’t heard of Iberia boy I sure do now. The crew was absolutely lovely people and patient with us passengers on a 7 hour flight. The crew where respectful and graceful as they attended to everyone’s needs especially the lil children on the flight. The pilots where giving us updates when needed. The seats are roomy and we flew economy. The meals are tasty and the movie selection was fantastic 😎🇨🇮🇨🇮👍🍀"
8.81582832336426,5.01598691940308,"Iberia Flight Delays",1,"The reason for the 1 is not the flight, which was perfectly fine.   Our challenge is that we not only missed our connection in Madrid, but we were told that it was our fault (basically we took our sweet old time when the reality was that we were in completely sweaty clothes when we arrived at the connection gate).

The flight was 35 minutes late...and we had 40 minutes to get out of the plane, walk to customs, sit in that line, head down to the shuttle train, get to the terminal, and run to the gate.   We arrived 10 minutes late...also another 7 people had the same issue.

Iberia officially flagged this as our fault and would not rebook us on other flights...we pushed and pushed and pushed and eventually got on a flight to another airport (this was the last flight to San Sebastián that day), had to rent a car, and drive to the hotel...instead of arriving at 5pm we pulled in at 1:30am.

They are the ones who moved the EAS flight 25 minutes earlier from when we booked, they told us we had ample time to make the connection, and they refused to help us when we missed this flight.  So poor on so many levels.

The flight was fine, so to me the take away is to have at least 2 hours if you are connecting through Madrid, especially in the summer.  I personally will not fly this airline again as long as I have a reasonable alternative."
5.36324262619019,7.40002489089966,"Iberia Flight Review",3,"New trend is that you purchase tickets with an Airline but the flight is operated by another one.  I purchased my tickets with American Airlines to travel from Miami to Madrid  on May 11, 2018.  The flight was operated by Iberia.  Be VERY VERY careful.  American will not assign the seat because it is up to Iberia.  Iberia will not do it because you purchase the ticket through American. My advise - get you seats assigned by strongly requesting them.  Otherwise you will be bouncing from one airline to another. You purchase your ticket and they are not cheap.  Tried to back extra legroom but it was not available due to the time I was able to stop the bouncing.
Iberia's airplane was very comfortable, good service and food was ok.  There was entertainment.
On the way back though - I flight with American.  Seats were better than Iberia since we were able to bough the extra legroom.  Be prepare to bring your own food. In a 12 hour flight + 30 minute s delayed they offered you 1 meal, 1 ice cream,  I snack type of tiny calzon and snack.  Best of it just ONE movie.  American need to remember people use to have three two meals a day - and offering just one movie during a 12 hr flight - daytime is really STINGY"
9.31202125549316,4.21868515014648,"Iberia Refund Policy",1,"I recently flew with Iberia airlines, booked through Expedia. The total cost of the trip was around $1200US.

I had a flight from Boston to Croatia with a connecting flight in Madrid. In Madrid, Iberia had some issues with boarding - the airport itself told passengers to go to one gate and the airline emailed passengers to go to a different gate to board. About 30 of us went to the wrong gate and they decided to put us on a bus to the airplane. When they began taking boarding passes, they checked boarding passes but did not scan them through any machine. They put us on a bus and I got on the plane and went to Dubrovnik. 

After my week in Dubrovnik ended, I attempted to leave on my return flight. Iberia told me that my ticket was cancelled because I missed my flight from Madrid to Croatia. This is obviously not true - they put me on my connecting flight on July 1 and I was calling them from the Dubrovnik airport. They did not email me to tell me that my ticket had been canceled. They refused to let me back on, give me a new ticket for the flight, or to put me on a different flight. I spoke to 4 different people at Iberia who told me that my only option was to buy a new ticket and then """"complain on the website."""" 

They left me stranded in Croatia overnight with no other options for return. I paid $175US for a hotel overnight in Dubrovnik, lost $80US on a hotel in Madrid I did not make it to, and I was forced to pay $1600US to get back to Boston with a different airline in order to make it home the day I was originally supposed to make it home.

A week after I got home, I called them again. Iberia told me that because I had booked through Expedia I had to make a complaint through them (this is the first time anyone told me that). I called Expedia and had them file a request for a refund. Iberia required me to send a copy of my boarding pass and from Madrid to Dubrovnik and so I did. They denied my request because I had been marked as a no-show DESPITE the fact that I was on the plane that they say I was not on. It is their mistake that there is no record of me being on the flight because their agents did not scan my boarding pass (they also didn't scan the boarding pass of the 30 other people at the gate - were their flights also cancelled?). They are now refusing to acknowledge their mistake and refund me my $1200US.

Clearly they could have warned us of this as they failed to put our luggage on board. We were put up overnight but the delay was hugely inconvenient as we missed pre-booked train links back to Swansea. Also I I had a lecture to deliver the following afternoon.
We requested compensation - as per EU regulations but have been refused. Avoid connecting flights through Madrid at all costs. The hotel they put us up  in offered dinner but the buffet food was completely inedible."

8.35848903656006,4.87894344329834,"Iberia Flight Delays",1,"My Trip with Iberia Airlines was absolutely awful. We had a layover from Zagreb to Madrid where the flight from Madrid would then go to New York. We had an hour to get boarding passes which they would not give us inside Greg and to get to the gate but near the end of the flight to Madrid the pilot told us that our takeoff was delayed leaving us with 15 minutes to get the boarding passes and to get to the gate. Not only was the entire thing extremely disorganized but numerous passengers also on the flight to New York also missed the flight because the pilot would not hold it. The only compensation we received was vouchers to a Hotel and we had to stay another day and take a flight the next day at 12. When we arrived the next morning we were able to get through security pretty easily with no major hold-ups. However20 minutes before the flight was supposed to board we then only find out that there is over a two-hour delay. Everybody is frantic and asking staff what is happening and why the flight was delayed. A majority of the staff cannot understand English or we're not interested in helping us and didn't care to offer information. My grandmother was in a wheelchair and thus had to be helped by a staff member. While everybody was frantically trying to find information we kept asking the woman helping my grandmother for any information, but she could not speak any English, which I do not blame her for considering I do not expect anyone to. However as the problem increased the staff although they could not understand us instead chose to laugh at us and make fun of us for not being able to speak Spanish. They did not care to help us and instead chose to ignore us or to brush our problem off. Even the man checking your boarding pass didn't bother to offer us any information and instead chose to treat us as if we did not know what we were talking about and instead laughed at us and did not care to help. I was not as bothered by the fact that they did not care to offer us any information but the fact that we noticed that they were making fun of us and gossiping about us instead of choosing to help. They were being extremely rude and even resorting to calling us expletives (when we were right next to them)  while they simply ignored our concerns because we did not want to miss another flight. We felt extremely disrespected for the unprompted behavior and it was quite upsetting because it only made the situation more stressful.The staff even told us there was another delay and refused to take us to the gate although we had an email proving that we were supposed to board. Although there many hesitations and complaints, they reluctantly took us to the gate. The whole process was extremely disorganized as there were no clerks at the boarding gate to offer any information while nobody could understand the intercom and there were groups of people crowding around the door leading to the plane. We (my family) technically had to fend for ourselves as the staff did not bother to help us as they were too busy talking in the corner. They were all just being extremely rude to us or no reason, even talking to other passengers about us. 

The fight wasn't much better as the cabin crew were also quite rude as they treated the passengers as if they were a burden or an annoyance as they had a very cold demeanor, did not want to help us, or rolled their eyes at other passengers. The whole trip was extremely exasperating and frustrating as this whole Airline and Airport was extremely disorganized and unhelpful. I genuinely thought I was never going to get home without encountering major issues such as even more delays or missed flights. A severely do not recommend this Airline although it is cheap, you do get what you pay for it, which may result in countless issues with your airport, schedule or even customer support / staff."

Check in at the airports in both countries was organized and I was able to book my seat online in advance to make things even easier.
Flight schedules were respected and luggage was quick coming out onto the conveyor belt.
The crew was very polite and always smiling. They were also generous with respect to requests for food or drinks.
If you drink alcohol, I recommend the beer. (Mahou from a Madrid brewery)
Seats were ok, although I am almost 6 feet tall. I managed to sleep a bit, but economy is usually tough with respect to leg room and general confort.

All went well until baggage claim where his suitcase was missing. He was told to go to his hotel and they would contact him. What follows is what only can be described as the worst customer service ever. He was met with hostility, rudeness and being told lies as to where his case was. It eventually turned up 48 hours later on Saturday evening. He missed the wedding as everything he needed was in his case. Not one member of staff he spoke to was interested or apologetic for ruining his weekend.

Their check in computers jumped to Spanish completely randomly, causing you to start all over again, until it completely crashed. There was no help to get from the Iberia staff on location and the solution was to check in manually. While waiting in line, the barriers were changed two times causing 50+ people to rearrange everything, with expected results. Almost at the end of the cue, a staff member pulls us and two other couples out of the cue, says something in Spanish and walks away. I catch up with him for explications, and he tries to explain that he has other check in desks around the corner.
We get there only to face the most unfriendly check in agent I have ever seen, who tell us that we have no checked luggage for the flight. When presented with the receipt for both flight and luggage, she claims that the receipt is invalid since it's from a third party, (Flight Network), and proceeds to charge us €70 extra. The other options would be to leave it behind, or not go on the flight we already paid for.
If a company chooses to sell their services through a 3rd party, it is theirs to honor what is bought through that 3rd party, and entirely up to them to resolve issues between themselves. The fact that I have to resolve this as a customer is not only unprofessional, it is Fraud! An offence that in most countries is a felony offence!
At this point the atmosphere was not good to say the least. But a tiny plus was that she managed to assign to us seats on 3rd row. When we entered the plain we saw that this was right behind the business class divider, which is comfortably forward in the plane. The seats were a different color than the rest of the economy class seats, but otherwise the same shape and size so I thought nothing of it, until a stewardess came and asked us to relocate as she needed those seats for someone else (a lie!).
I tried to explain that we had been assigned those seats for the discomfort of the check in errors. She immediately got very unfriendly and rudely said that we were being moved, because we had not purchased business class seats, and it was clear that we had no choice in the matter if we wanted to fly at all!
She then moved the divider back one row. Throughout the flight the entire 3rd row, seats A-F, remained empty!
After relocating, the flight crew continued to be unfriendly. And we found out that there is more than a color difference between the seats, and the cushions of economy class are unnaturally uncomfortable. We suspect that is more due to their higher usage, than them being uncomfortable on purpose.

The wines served with dinner: Rolland Galarreta Ribera (2015), Baigorri Rioja Crianza (2015), Artero Mancha Reserva (2013), Val de Vid Rueda (2017) were excellent.

As we live in La Palma in the Canary islands our local airport is quite small and does not have many connections. Iberia offered us a flight via Madrid with only 90 mins stopover to change planes. The problem was that it would take two days to get back to La Palma so we ended up buying two one way flights. To go we flew Iberia La Palma - Madrid - Mallorca but the connection in Madrid on the return was not possible so we had to stay overnight. We were not willing to stay overnight so to get back we booked a flight Mallorca - Madrid - Tenerife North with Iberia and then booked a local flight to La Palma with Binter (our local airline) so we got home the same day.

Both British and Iberia are miles behind Air France and Lufthansa. This review is only for our recent experience with Iberia.

Check-in was terrible. There is a clearly marked counter at O'Hare for Premium Economy... but it is not manned, so they instructed us to stand in line with all the other passengers flying regular coach. In Madrid there are no Premium Economy counters, just Business and Tourist. This contradicts their advertisement: """"With the new Premium Economy service, you will have a separate fast lane access to Tourist class check-in counters."""" False claim! 

Boarding and disembarkation were very good! First it's families with little ones, people who might need help boarding, Business Class and other hotshots. Then us, in Group A. We were also the first ones out of the plane, which was super nice.

Meal service: Nothing special, it is identical to the meal service in regular coach. In Lufthansa and AirFrance, Premium Economy has its own menu and better beverages than regular economy, not so in Iberia. Also, for a nine hour flight, they only offer you water or juice before taking off, one beverage with dinner and another with breakfast, and one bottle of water when dimming the lights for the flight. And that's it. I requested a second wine, they totally ignored me. You have to go to the galley to get anything else or die of thirst. Breakfast is terrible, just a sandwich with junk food products (KitKat bar, yogurt, crackers).

They give you also a toiletry kit, which is very practical. It was a red stretchy cloth baggie with the usual: socks, toothbrush, toothpaste, mask, and earplugs; it also included a hairband, which I though was a nice touch.

Overall Assessment: It was an OK experience, very basic. You get better seats and faster boarding... and a toiletry kit. You do get to check in a second bag for free also, if you need it. Other than that, it's exactly the same as regular economy.

We bought our tickets with a promotional fare price and we were traveling specifically to Spain, without any other connections, so it was a worthwhile purchase after all.

Don't arrive too early as there will be no one to serve you earlier than 2 hours before flight time. Check in was straight forward and there was a small lounge for business with Austrian style breakfast. We are used to getting to Vienna from London using British Airways. BA's business is cramped with very, very poor legroom especially if you are tall. The difference with the Iberian business seats just jumped out at us when we sat down. More than ample legroom and better comfort than BA. The service was excellent and the breakfast more European. Madrid was something to experience. The airport is huge. You arrive in the domestic terminal and have to transfer to the international terminal. The sign said 24 minutes to transit. What it didn't tell you was that it was walk, train and walk some more. Clearly sign posted though. I was worried that the connection was too tight but despite masses of people we made it well within time. If you have time the shopping choices excel. The flight showed two gates next to one another which made boarding easier. Onboard the A340-600 the seats were 1-2-1. The seats were an older design but extremely efficient. The video screen was large and always in front of you as it did not need to fold away. On the way out to London from New York on American we were warned not to put anything under the seat as it would be lost or damaged when the seat was conformed into the lie flat position. This meant no storage. Iberia's seat allowed you a small space to store a bag when the seat was in lie flat position and an additional space next to the seat. We found this useful. What really stunned us was the quality of the food. You could have nuts with a drink but there was also really tasty olives as a choice. The """"tapas"""" of starters made it seem that the entree had arrived as well. Its hard to describe but the food was a real touch of Spain and what Spain is famous for. An excellent flight all the way with attentive cabin crew. There was just one """"yellow card"""". Iberia lands at Terminal 7 at JFK. If you are connecting, you have to pick up your bags and re-check them after customs. Iberia didn't have anyone there to assist or otherwise advise fast enough. There was just a British Airways rep who was being bombarded by 30 people all trying to get their bags rechecked. And don't try to take your luggage on the AirTrain between terminals. If the trains are full you will be waiting. Overall, great experience with Iberia. We will try them again next month to see if it repeats."

Well, in what could be interpreted as a further step to make the trips of its customers as uncomfortable as possible, the Company is replacing the seating configuration in some of its aircrafts. Specifically, the A320 in which we flew, had new seats from row 7, narrower, with shorter armrests (so short that you cannot share it with the passenger next to you) and –surprisingly—the new seat cannot be reclined. Yes, you have read well. The new Iberia seats cannot be reclined. The highest discomfort is for passengers in row 7, given that the seats in rows 1-6 can be reclined (because it is the """"Business"""" configuration), so they will have the traveler in front of them with the reclined chair in front of his face. An unpleasant experience on long flights (we suffer it for more than 4 hours). In the new configuration, the seats of """"Business"""" correspond now to a model very similar to the previous tourist seats (ie. a passenger of Business now pays for the comfort of a previous “tourist” seat, with the only advantage of having the central seat free). Special comment for the """"emergency exit"""" that, if I remember correctly, it enjoyed a somewhat larger space for legs precisely because it was an emergency exit. Well, with the new seats, such """"extra"""" space has disappeared. I imagine that some authority has approved this configuration of the plane, but common sense tells me that, in case of urgent evacuation, this new arrangement of seats could pose an additional risk to passengers. Possibly, one more step towards the """"low-cost"""" strategy of Iberia."

By 9 p.m, the flight was scheduled to leave at 2:40 a.m. I checked it again at 10 p.m., still scheduled for 2:40 a.m. Around 10:30, I went to check the status again and found out it had changed to 11 p.m.! So we ran through the entire airport to get to our new gate, got shuttled on to a miserably hot bus that drove us around the airport for about 5 -8 minutes. We got to the plane and they made us stand on the bus for another 10 minutes. They finally let us off the bus and we stood around for another 10 minutes and then they told us that they didn't have clearance to depart, so we had to get back on the bus and go back to the airport to wait for the 2:40 a.m. departure time. The agents were so rude - I saw one of them yelling at two girls in their early 20s and being so disrespectful to many other people. They didn't offer any sort of compensation to anyone that I know of. Would not fly them again."

We had a question and were sent to one agent and then that agent sent us to another line and then the agents blamed each other for the miscommunication. We ended up being the last ones on the plane even though we arrived 3 hours ahead of time! We sat in back of Iberian employees and the whole trip it felt like they cared more to cater to them then to us. At one point I even asked for a cup of water and she told me I would have to wait but when the employee in front of me asked she brought him a big water bottle. It was a very frustrating experience.

The food was actually decent, and there was plenty of beverage service as well.
My return trip was just as good. I was seated in 45J, but the entire middle section across the aisle was empty, so after take-off, I moved over and pretty much had my own personal suite.

However if you need to check in a bag or want to select your seat then there are extra costs on the economy ticket, drinks and snacks on the plane is also extra. I tend to buy a bottle of water and probably a small snack at the various vendor machines around Madrid airport before boarding, this is much cheaper than in the airport shops or on the plane. 

Ocaasionly when the flight is ful Iberia will invite you to check in your bag free of charge when you arrive at the airport. However don't rely on this but pay the €12 or €15  for a check in bag when you book your flight because the cost is higher if you pay at the check in desk in the airport."

There was already a long line of travelers at the """"British Airways"""" (BA) counter. The BA flight was leaving for Barcelona at the same time as our ticket. There was no one manning the Information Desk to address my query. I was concerned not seeing any Iberia flight at the electronic monitor, not realizing that BA services Iberia bookings too- which was clarified much later. The electronic ticket issued should have manifested that. Our electronic tickets required for the printing of the boarding passes at the check-in kiosks, but apparently none of the kiosks were working. The other passengers in the long queue could not also address my query if BA flight as seen on the monitor would also accommodate our Iberia electronic tickets. We took our chance to line up for 45 minutes in that line heading for Barcelona. It was to our dismay to be told by the staff at the counter that the airline has overbooked by 10%, and we were told to approach a certain counter at 6:50 to find out if we would be accommodated or not. I was quite disappointed to be given that advice considering there was a still a long line after us. How come we were chosen to be excluded from the processing, and not those at the last end of the line? We were given breakfast coupons to be redeemed at cafes on the 2nd floor. Carrying our heavy and big pieces of luggage through the escalator, we reached the 2nd floor to be shooed away rudely by an airport staff, stating that we should be checked in first. I was explaining to him that we were not accommodated yet as flight was overbooked. He did not want us to use the coffee shop. I was on the verge of losing my temper for his rudeness. We did not have to be further aggravated by his demeanor. We went down to the designated counter where to follow up on our status. There were other 2-3 other equally upset families not accommodated too. When it was my turn to talk to the staff, I kindly implored from the staff that our family could not miss this flight, nor we would allow ourselves to be split up on separate flights. We prepared well for this trip and it was not going to be ruined by the airline's fault. I have hotel booking in Barcelona and confirmed tours (2) upon our arrival. The flight was leaving at 7:40 and it was already 7:00 then. For some twist of luck, we were chosen and given boarding passes, leaving the other 3 families behind. We had to literally run to have security processed, and head to the gate which was quite a distance. I was thankful and at the same time so stressed out. It was the beginning of our Western Europe tour and the experience was not really that pleasant. The staff during the flight were all nice.

Vigo Airport is small, but clean and has a small cafeteria that allows you to have breakfast or lunch.  Iberia has a few counters and the security checks is small, effective and fast.  
In Vito you will board a bus on the gate that will take you to the jet, which was an airbus A321.  Everything was right on time, even the takeoff was tied at 50 mins past the hour.

Of course, Madrid is a huge airport.  Mind that gates are displayed 30 minutes prior to boarding time, so be ready to head for T4S or stay at T4.  But within 12 mins, you should reach your gate if you have to change to T4S (satellite via train).

On Malaga, which is a big airport, take advantage of the train!  Really cheap and immediately available outside of the baggage claim.   Train departs every ten minutes all the way down to Fuengirola while stopping on many other stations for about 2.5 euros or so.

I have never dealt with a more incompetent airline or staff in my life. We fly 20+ times a year and never have I written a negative review (not after food poisoning about a restaurant, salon, airline, etc) but everyone deserves to be warned prior to booking a flight with Iberian air, they cost us $3500 + and wouldn’t refund our return tickets. Series of events is below, we took a flight from Boston to Madrid on 6/7/2018-6/8/2018. Our flight was approximately 20-30 minutes late to leave from Boston on Iberian air. Our suggested layover by Iberian air from Madrid to Barcelona was approximately 1 hour. This hour layover is the flight route they suggest online while booking, we booked a round trip back to Boston on 6/18. Due to the long customs line and security over 20% of the passengers missed their next flight, we RAN (not walked) through the airport. By the time we made it to the gate the airplane was closed, us and 25 + people missed the flight. My husband and I had reservations in Barcelona later that day with a pre paid group. We called Iberian air to request another flight, they couldn’t guarantee us to be on a flight until the next day, it is 8:00am at this time. The customer service rep we spoke to suggested we book a flight on Vueling, they’re partner airline. We did this for $300 without complaint, while not being refunded for the flight from Madrid to Barcelona. The flight to Madrid is an hour and a half. Fast forward to 6/17, we are checking in for our flight from Granada to Barcelona.

Our complaint with Iberia airlines began when we were stuck waiting to board at the rear doors of the aircraft on the steps in the hot Moroccan sun for 20 minutes, only to be told they needed to close the rear door so we would have to walk to the front. My mother, with her bad knee, and I walked back to the front doors of the aircraft where we were the last ones on board. At the top of the steps a man begins putting tags on our hand luggage without saying a word to us. I ask if this means they will have to be checked and he just says “NO SPACE NO SPACE” and gestures inside. I understand we are the last ones on the plane (not intentionally) so there is no space left but they could at least tell us what was happening with our bags instead of taking our luggage without a word. 
Inside the plane, there is no soap in the toilets which we realized after another passenger spilt Coca Cola on top of my mother wearing all white and even got on a brand new 200€ leather belt. Now the belt is ruined, shirt stained, and my mother is completely sticky. 
On arrival in Madrid, we wait to collect our bags next to the plane as the agent in Marrakech had instructed us. One of the flight attendants informed us that our bags were “probably” en route to the final destination of Malta. We replied that there was no information given, as to our final destination, so we deduced that the bags must be in Madrid. We are then told that “most likely” our bags were in Madrid but we would have to go outside security to collect them and then come back. After waiting at the baggage claim the bags finally arrived. We narrowly made our next flight and were one of the last on this flight as well.
On our next flight we were lied to by two agents saying there was absolutely no space for our bags but once we were inside we found at least 10 empty spaces (as well as numerous empty seats) that we could have used rather than leaving our bags to get lost again.
Overall a miserable experience flying with Iberia, I would recommend flying any of the low-cost airlines who have a better standard of service than this. I would have rather swam through the med than gone through this. My mother might not have many trips left and this company certainly ruined one of them."

3) The flight connection in Madrid was delayed over two hours without any explanation at all. I did receive an email from Iberia around that time, but it was in GERMAN and I couldn’t understand what it said. Why was it in German?

They left us crammed into the bus, waiting like that for FIFTEEN minutes. 5) They finally let us out of the bus to walk up the steps up to the plane. The problem was that they opened BOTH doors.

I was originally supposed to fly out of Boston to Philly, then connect in Philly to fly to Rome. However, weather issues and delays in Boston would have caused me to miss my connecting flight, so they switched and put me on an Iberia flight to Madrid from Boston, then Madrid to Rome. Big mistake.

The flight itself was fine, there were no issues. It was cramped but that's usually the case with those types of flights when you're flying Economy, I have yet to fly in a plane that's roomy. The issues came when I got off the plane and tried to find my connecting flight to Rome, as there was some confusion about which gate my flight was departing from. Since it was 4:30 in the morning, there wasn't anyone around the airport to really help me. Any Iberia employee I tried to talk to was rude and dismissive, only lifting a finger to help when I persisted. As a result, I ended up going through security three different times because I was told three different times that my gate was in a different terminal.

Finally, I find the gate. The flight itself was fine, but when I headed over to the baggage claim, my suitcase wasn't there. I waited for 45 minutes. I finally went to the Lost & Found, which was totally unhelpful and useless. They blamed Iberia for losing my bag, so I filed a claim.

I try calling Iberia to file a claim and follow up with them, and nothing. Nothing. Their American assistance line does not offer English, because the people I tried to speak with didn't speak it. Also, sometimes no one would answer the phone, and when they did, they would put me on hold and then disconnect me. I couldn't get through to anyone. This went on for 5 days.

I ended up calling American Express and they followed up. In less than 10 hours my suitcase was delivered to me, no thanks to Iberia. Horrible, horrible airline, I will never fly them ever again. Don't make the same mistake I did!"

8.08397579193115,5.90706300735474,"Iberia Flight Delays",1,"This was our flight home from a trip to Argentina, connecting through Madrid. 
In my opinion, the seats on the trans-Atlantic flight are really uncomfortable, with the passenger in front of you basically sitting in your lap. My back was also not amused by this posture. 
Shortly after boarding, I discovered some trash and wet dirt (mostly in the form of a half-eaten sandwich) in the seat pocket - really disgusting. The flight attendant took the half-eaten sandwich with disgust, but no additional cleaning was offered. 
However, the main issue was the time of the connection flight that was sold to us by Iberia. We had a gap of ~1 hour from landing in Madrid to our connecting flight, which sounds like it should be enough, and therefore we weren't worried when Iberia sold us this connection. However, when we landed in Madrid it turned out that the terminal where our plane landed is ~30 minutes away (by walking + airport train) from the terminal where our connection flight was. Since the line at the border control was also ~30 minutes, and boarding to the connecting flight closed 15 minutes before takeoff, we eventually missed our connection by a few minutes. Given their routine use of Madrid airport, I would expect Iberia to know that a 1 hour gap is not likely to be enough and to advise us accordingly. 
After missing our connection, we had to stand in line to get a replacement flight arranged. This was simply a nightmare - there were only 5 groups of people in front of us, but the service was EXTREMELY slow so we ended up waiting ~1.5 hours in this line until the replacement flight was finally arranged. Requests to bring more Iberia representatives to the service counter (for the most part there were only 2 Iberia representatives, and the line just kept getting longer behind us) were rudely ignored. One representative even had the audacity to leave her shift while the line was growing longer. By the time we finally reached a representative, my wife was already quite distraught (and rightfully so). However, instead of apologizing profusely, the representative behaved very rudely, accused us of being late for the connecting flight we had missed, and shouted at my wife until she began crying. This should have been avoided, and would have been avoided had our waiting time been shorter, and had the representative been better trained (or better screened before she was allowed to work with customers). 
In addition, Iberia representatives (both at the gate and at the service desk) assured us that our luggage has not been sent with the flight we had missed, and would be waiting for us at our final destination when we arrived with the new flight. However, this was not the case, and we had to go to the lost in found desk at the Vienna airport. There are 2 lost and found service desks in Vienna, each taking care of different airlines: one service desk had 3 representatives and no line, and the other had only 1 representative and and a ~30 minute line - guess which one serviced Iberia customers?... So we had to wait another 30 minutes (this is after ~25 hours in airports) for our luggage that had not arrived as promised. As expected, we found out that our luggage had already arrived with the connecting flight we had missed, but at this time there was no one who could locate and deliver it, so it was scheduled to be delivered to our home the next morning ~8 AM. However, by 12 PM no one had called us, so we called the lost and found and were told that they had called my cell at 8 AM and there was no answer (more lies, of course there was no record of such a call...). Finally, a few hours later, the luggage arrived. 
So, a very bad experience all around - and we are not likely to fly with Iberia for at least a decade."

Apparently they didn’t coordinate who’s using the gate right now so we’re still waiting. 

First of all, they keep the plane at a healthy 55°. There are no personal air vents so you’re at the mercy of the $12 blankets they walk around selling. Out of the entire 8 hours, they never looked our way one single time unless we ordered food. (Which apparently you have to do when you book the flight months ago? So sorry, you’ll have to go hungry). By hour 5, I had to literally flag the flight attendant down to get a glass of water. She said if I didn’t want to buy the one in the bottle, I had to GET UP and go get it MYSELF in the back of the plane.

The line at the unnecessary security check between connecting flights upon arriving in Madrid--unnecessary because no one has left the secure area since de-planing--stretched halfway across the terminal and took over half an hour to get through.

5.47038221359253,8.85660171508789,"Iberia Flight Review",5,"We ended up flying business class non-stop with Iberia for three reasons. (1) Didn't want to risk missing the last connecting flight out of Miami to Madrid; this non-stop only had a choice of Economy or Business Class (we need to fly at least premium economy since our bodies just don't fit into those regular economy seats anymore). (2) Didn't want to fly through LHR on our way to Madrid (thus Iberia connecting through Miami rather than British Airways connecting through London). (3) Wanted to see if we could actually sleep on a plane if we were in lay flat seats (while premium economy is roomy enough, we never can get much sleep). 

The best things about flying Business Class were having your own line at the check-in desk, having access to the airport lounge, boarding the plane before economy fliers, and having plenty of room in the overhead bin. The preflight hot towel and welcome orange juice were nice treats also.  Our seats had plenty of room and were very comfortable.  I think I could have slept very well, if it hadn't been for all the turbulence we encountered. It always seemed to happen just when I was starting to drift off to sleep ... *sigh*  Anyway, the food was great - much better than I had expected it to be - and it was all very filling.  I did not have to dig into any of the snacks I had brought on board just in case I didn't care for the provided meals, or if these meals were insufficient for my appetite. 

About the only bad thing was boarding started about 30 minutes late, which made the flight about 20 minutes late taking off. I seem to recall we made up some time, so landed close to our originally scheduled time (?). Since we landed at the Satellite Terminal, it took quite awhile to make it over to baggage claim.  I think our bags were already on the luggage carousel by time we arrived at baggage claim.

While I was a bit wary of flying Iberia based upon others' reviews, I did not have any issues with the flight or level of service.

I have been emailing them bi-monthly since returning in January and yet to be reimbursed for what is owed to me from my delayed luggage. When arriving in Spain they had lost my luggage. The employees either had no knowledge of procedure or did not care, either way they were some of the worst customer service agents I have ever encountered. They did not offer my an overnight kit as their website states they will, they did not have any idea when my luggage would arrive, nor did they know how I would get new things or if it would be covered by the company. Since returning I am well aware of the LAWS that they are required to uphold, but do NOT. I have all the documents with my receipts of cost incurred due to their misplacing my luggage. I have received nothing. They seem to know they are awful and have issue often as it is nearly impossible to speak to anyone in customer service that takes ownership in the company. Do NOT fly this airline. 
On the way back their ticket agent did not check us into our connecting flight in London so when we arrived our seats were given away and we were stuck in London an additional day. Great unless you have jobs and children to get back to and nothing with you to have an overnight trip."

I called the next day to be told we could take the clubs but we couldn't pay over the phone, we would just pay for them when we checked in.  Oh no, we waited in the very long queue (as I wasn't able to check in online, first time that has happened as well) and was told we would need to go to another desk to pay for the clubs, and then bring them back.  The other desk was grossly undermanned so we waited there over 20 minutes. Then we had to go back to the desk and after the bag was eventually tagged then check in desk attendant closed her desk and walked with us to the outsize baggage, which she needed to activate.

A quick description of our recent ordeal with Iberia. It may help other travellers avoid enduring a similarly  unpleasant experience.

Iberia is a disgraceful and poor excuse for an airline.

My partner and I recently travelled to Europe and booked our flights with Iberia. It turned out to be the worst possible choice.

Upon starting our return trip to SA, my partner ended up  being stuck in Milan Malpensa for over 36 hours and, thanks to the shoddy and unprofessional Iberia’s “service”,  for another 24 hours thereafter, when they refused to re-route him to Madrid on a different airline!

Iberia cancelled his flight from Milan to Madrid (while waiting for his boarding time at the airport) and caused him to miss his Iberia connecting flight to Johannesburg.

Worse, yet, Iberia never made any announcements to alert passengers of the cancellation. My partner was therefore forced to check into a hotel for the night AT HIS OWN EXPENSE just like for his dinner and transport. And, at this point, still no contact being made by Iberia.

Iberia have no staff, representatives or handling office on the ground at Milan Malpensa. Passengers were left stranded and without any assistance whatsoever.
I, too, en-route to Joburg  from Vienna (via Madrid), personally tried to get ground staff to assist  once I got to Madrid but to no avail. 
In decades of extensive international travels I have never encountered such dismissive, unhelpful and downright rude behaviour as I have while dealing with Iberia ground staff.

Due to Iberia’s lack of interest, professional ethics and shoddy organizational skills, my partner was eventually forced to spend a SECOND NIGHT in Milan instead of being booked on the first flight home on a different airline. No apologies or show of any kind of interest in the welfare of their passengers.

It’s also worth mentioning that Iberia can only be contacted (both locally and internationally) via one phone number………but wait……….only from a landline…………to hell all those travellers who are on the go and only have mobile phones on them!
For those lucky few who manage to get themselves to a landline and, after much ado, through to an Iberia operator………they get to enjoy a morose and unhelpful interaction with an ill-trained and uninformed consultant who, 9 times out of 10, will hang up on you when the questions you pose become too….complex?

Their website is also an exemplary case of utter inefficiency! It stonewalls anyone’s attempt at pre-booking seats on line…….it lets you go through the entire, tedious procedure and then it refuses to process the request! We personally tried FIVE times. A ploy to get passengers requesting a window seat to pay extra at the check-in counter. Absolutely disgusting!

Once I finally touched down in Joburg, I immediately contacted Swissport (the handling agent for Iberia at O.T. airport).

Swissport staff were absolutely helpful and APPALLED at the ordeal we were being subjected to. The Manager of Operations, Sandra Guedes, and two other ladies, kindly and repeatedly contacted Iberia requesting that our situation be resolved as a matter of urgency. Despite working with Iberia their requests were met with the same dismissive and unhelpful attitude I have already described.

 The very people at SWISSPORT, hired to handle this disgusting airline, were also appalled at the extent of the damage and inconvenience Iberia keeps causing the people who travel with their airline. The ladies went out of their way to help but Iberia refused to listen and to accept responsibility for their ridiculous lack of service.
Iberia’S staff both at the call centre (THE LANDLINE ONE)and in Madrid on the ground are RUDE, ABRUPT, UNWILLING TO ASSIST and downright LAZY!!!!! Let’s also not forget that their inability to PROFICIENTLY communicate in English only adds to the frustration of already disgruntled travellers!

Following a request both from SWISSPORT and from us to address our concerns and process a refund for costs incurred (over 200 EUROS) on their account, Iberia replied:

“We apologise for the inconvenience caused in relation to the cancellation of flight IB3255 on 12/05/2018.
Airlines are affected may factors, such as weather conditions and air control permissions.
 
We understand that these circumstances make travelling more tiring, and although the reasons are beyond our control we do everything within our power to minimise the inconvenience.

We were pleasantly surprised - the plane was spotless, staff friendly, seats comfortable and food good!
Due to unfortunate circumstances, we did however miss our connecting flight in Madrid to Seville. It was the beginning of a long weekend and finding alternative arrangements was problematic. However, the friendly lady at the Iberia helpdesk was so helpful and went to extraordinary lengths to help us get to Seville - in the end the only solution was to go by train.

Paris but an extra special one because we had only just got married. 

First the Athens to Lisbon experience : 
1) Couldn’t check in online 
2) We weren’t seated together despite being on the same booking (this was rectified by asking a passenger to swap) 
3) seats are TINY & uncomfortable. Leg room is non existent. Both my husband and I are 170cm and my knees were touching the seat in front after i placed a book in the seat pocket!  
4) food & beverages offered were terrible 
5) bad communication - flight departing Athens was a little delayed & we had to run between gates at Madrid to board our flight to Lisbon (30 min between flights instead of the scheduled 60). We already had boarding passes. We double checked that our bags would make the connection - this was confirmed. 
6) upon landing - no bags! they didn’t even try to get it on the plane. We were told they were already on the next flight over & would be delivered to our hotel that night. This threw out our plans for the night completely. Bags thankfully arrived intact 6 or so hours later. 

Lisbon to Paris 
1) flight cancelled (via text) less than 24 hours before. We were out of Lisbon on a day trip with limited/no WiFi access and I didn’t receive the cancellation email till much later that night. 
2) automatically rebooked on a flight for a day later (36 hours after original flight)  - Iberia had our customer details, phone numbers etc but NO explanation was offered for flight cancellation. We already had prepaid accommodation and activities in Paris for the final 3 nights of our honeymoon & had to travel on the day as planned or would have forfeited our accommodation. 
3) they did not tell us that all Iberia flights to Paris that day were cancelled. They did not tell us their budget airline was flying that day, when we asked they wouldn’t put us on that flight. 
4) They refused to allow us to board the flight to Madrid (which was not cancelled) so we could look at other alternatives from Madrid to Paris. Ground staff were shockingly rude and unhelpful. Their attitude was “wait till tomorrow or buy another flight” 
5) their help line is not in English - there is no press “x” for English option. We ended up googling for a US help desk and spoke to a gentlemen who at least told us what our flight options were (budget airline). 

In the end we purchased new tickets with another airline who got us on the earliest available direct flight and we arrived in Paris earlier than we had planned. This allowed us to go to the Iberia desk at CGD. Again, unhelpful. No one could tell us how to lodge a claim, or where to do it. Finally (after 45 min of confusion & being sent around from desk to desk) we were told it was an online system. No apology. No acknowledgement of their poor communication. 

Fortunately we weren’t restricted monetarily and could purchase alternate flights - I would have been gutted to have missed (or cut short our time in Paris). 

We filed an online claim that day, with evidence of our pre-booked itinerary and activities and why we needed to travel that particular day. Some 10 days later, a generic email was sent to my husband - basically saying “too bad, we don’t do refunds if you choose not to take the flights we gave you”. No compensation for the time/money lost, no explanation why they wouldn’t let us fly halfway to Madrid. Nothing. And best of all, the email is generated and sent via a “no reply” email so there’s no option for follow up/appeal. So dodgy. Their business practices are questionable. I am truly surprised at the positive feedback this airline receives. You couldn’t pay me enough money to fly Iberia again.

I flew Naples to JFK and here were the problems I experienced: 1) Could not check-in online prior to arriving at the airport (and I tried multiple times); 2) the seats in Economy were SO small; virtually no legroom (I couldn't even put a book in the seat pocket in front of me or my knees would've been hitting it- I'm 5'8"""") or space between your seat partner; 3) seats were incredibly uncomfortable, like sitting on a piece of wood; 4) awful food; I'm a vegetarian, but they ran out of pasta by the time they got to me, so I was given the meatball plate. I did not eat the meatballs but will tell you that the rest of the plate was not good: stale tasting bread, a corn salad and a minuscule piece of apple """"cake"""".  And although I didn't eat the meatballs, my seatmate said they were disgusting.  We also only had 1 drink provided w/ the dinner, no follow-up 2nd drink when collecting trash (I have always gotten a 2nd drink on every other intl flight); 5) unhelpful staff: when requesting a pasta choice/saying I was vegetarian, the attendant was incredibly rude & would not give me any kind of different food (any extra bread, chips, anything) but instead snarkily told me that I should have selected my food online before flying. Well, that would have been great, if their POS website actually worked. I also asked a diff attendant for another glass of wine (since we weren't given but 1 drink) and her response was incredibly short, telling me that I'd have to go to the back of the plane and ask for it (they can't even bring someone a drink to their seat?) and also I'd have to wait until such and such time; 6) Dirty bathrooms

The only reason I'm giving this airline 2 stars is because the ride was smooth (so really this is a star to the pilot, not the airline) and there was a USB port and movies to watch inflight (although the movie options were less than stellar compared to other airlines).

6.33983945846558,8.47548484802246,"Iberia Flight Review",4,"At last posing much needed competition with Avianca for the direct flight from Medellín to Madrid, we were happy to try Iberia for the first time. 
In Business Class, Iberia has followed the trend in seat configuration using angled seats, alternating by row, one seat on either window side and two in the center. The effect is to provide considerable privacy, making each seat almost a private niche, not conducive for those who enjoy socializing with other passengers.

In Medellín we had access to the lounge shared with Panama's Copa Airlines. It must be rather new, since there were no Iberia markings at reception and it was a trek to find. The lounge is spartan, with perfunctory snacks offered at one far end. At the other end, a bar will furnish complementary drinks.

Iberia's seats were more comfortable in my opinion than Avianca's, where leg-room was cramped in flat-bed selection, and rising from the seat awkward.  Iberia flies Airbus A330, Avianca uses Airbus A320. At the time I believe we actually paid less for the Iberia roundtrip than Avianca's best price, however, it appears now that Iberia's fares may be several hundred dollars higher.

Meals on Iberia are expedited by serving appetizer and main course together on one tray, with dessert separate. Food was not remarkably tasty, and certainly not exceptional.

Comfortable in my seat, I slept from after dinner until breakfast. Service was professional and responsive, unlike my experience with Avianca, where I felt ignored and remarked the crew spent most of the flight chatting in the galley without once checking on passenger needs, at least in my case.

It is fortunate, in far-flung Colombia to have a choice of airlines flying non-stop to Madrid and a number of U.S. destinations, without changing planes in Bogotá. As Medellín grows in technology and prestige we hope to see more direct flight opportunities. For now, we are happy to be able to enjoy Madrid, non-stop, with a choice of airlines."

On every confirmation we had on our side, there was NO middle name, but on their side they said they were seeing one and so that we had to pay extra fees to change that f****** middle name. Load of crap to steal money from customers. After 3 hours they agreed to give us a discount of 50$ so instead of paying 250$ extra we paid ONLY 200$ more on our flight price...

As I am a frequent flier with British Airways, we chose the latter option, thinking that the standards would be similar to BA. But British Airways it was not. It was an economy class flight, granted: but the legroom was minimal, the noise was high (overnight flight), the staff not particularly kind (on every transatlantic flight, even if between two Spanish speaking countries, I believe they should also try to speak some English), the food inedible, the manners of the fellow passengers below standard. Disappointing."

Got in touch with their customer 'service' (with lots of difficulties) and finally on Facebook they told me that my booking got cancelled """"because the payment didn't go through"""". I seriously doubt that as not only the payment was successfully """"reserved"""" in my state of expenditure but all other payments did go through fine. Also they never informed me in any way that there would be a problem, making me believe my trip is booked as usual. A very travel savvy person might have become suspicious because the confirmation e-mail didn't contain an e-ticket yet, I have learnt that lesson only now (after many dozens of bookings with other airlines without problems). It seems very much like Iberia use this practice to overbook their flights without officially overbooking them: keeping customers standby all the time until the flight, charging them if there is a seat, letting them down if there isn't then legally avoiding to pay any compensation. I lost a whole trip and definitely won't risk ever booking with them again."

We arrived in Cape Town four hours before our flight and had ample time checking in so we made sure our luggage was checked all the way to Madrid.  Once we arrived in Johannesburg with only 1.5 hour between flights however we were told we had not been checked in all the way through Madrid even though our luggage were.  After a 20-25 minute delay they said we would be on standby for the connecting flight to Madrid.  We reminded them that our luggage were already on that flight and they either had the choice of pulling our luggage out (the law says luggage cannot fly without the owners) or that we had to be on that flight.  It was not our fault they made the mistake.  They finally found space for us on the flight (later on we saw empty seats on that flight so I don't know why we went through all of this in the first place).  
By then however it was so close to departure time that we were told to run which we started doing immediately.  Meanwhile, they had called someone to help get us there quicker.  I was told to sit in the wheelchair by staff and pretend I needed it so they could get me through security faster.  I eventually obliged but I don't like to lie so it felt very weird to do that.  Once through we were asked for money for that 'service'.  Again, since it was not our mistake to start with, we did not want to pay.  We thought this helped us go through faster until we saw the guy that was at the ticket counter at the same time as us, was ahead of us.  It was all a ploy to get money from us.  At least we made it to our flight with not a second to spare.
Once in Madrid we kept waiting for one of our two suitcase.  After the luggage carousel stopped turning, indicating that no more luggage was coming out, we asked Iberia staff about our missing luggage and their answer was that it had to be on that carousel and that we should just wait.  We waited another 20 minutes (for now a total of one hour after the belt had stopped running).  We then asked again and the lady at the counter was extremely rude and did not believe us.  She kept saying we didn't know where to look (she didn't know I understood Spanish and kept saying stuff under her breath to coworkers).  We pushed the issue so she finally came to the carousel and saw no luggage.  We kept saying it was probably stuck on the ramp going up to the belt but she didn't believe us.

We arrived at the airport at 4:30am and waited until check in at 5:15. This process seemed to take longer than usual but we made it through security and were at the gate with plenty of time to spare. Boarding was scheduled for 7:00 and that time came and went before we heard the news that we would be leaving late. We were told that an update would be given in 15 minutes. 

15 minutes later we were still delayed but would receive more information in 30 minutes. 30 minutes later we were told there was a mechanical issue and would receive more information in 45 minutes. 45 minutes later we were told that we were still delayed but that no new information was available but that we could go get breakfast at a restaurant on an upper level and come back in an hour for more information. Many of us were worried about missing connections but the airline attendants making the announcements were dismissive and we were told that once we got to Madrid they would arrange everything. 

The breakfast line was long and we could only choose from a croissant and hot drink per person. No water or juice for my 5 year old, who ended up eating both croissants leaving me with no food. 

There were still no new details by 12:30pm although we were told we would receive new information every hour. By 1 we were told that we would board at 1:45 because the mechanical issue had been fixed. Once again we were sent upstairs for lunch to get a sandwich and drink. We waited 45 minutes in line for a sandwich and cold drink, making it back just in time to sit around for another 15 minutes for them to begin boarding. 

When we arrived in Madrid, +45 passengers stood around the information desk to receive vouchers. French support was not provided  to those who only spoke this language and were very frustrated with the wait time and changes being offered by Iberia. But this was only the beginning. 

We were given boarding passes for flights rescheduled for the next day as well as a voucher. This voucher said we were provided accommodation in """"unknown hotel"""", dinner, breakfast and two calls. By law this is the bare minimum. When asked which hotel, the attendants simply said, ask downstairs. When asked where the bus was, the attendants simply said, ask downstairs. Our bags would travel directly to our destination so we were without a change of clothes, toothbrush, deodorant and all our other items for the night. 

I headed downstairs with my son to look for the bus. I found another Iberia attendant on the way and asked but she also said to ask downstairs. At around 4:30 we got downstairs and there were several buses but none said they would be taking us and to ask Iberia. I chatted up some of the other passengers who were also frustrated and a few of us went up to ask at the desk. The desk attendant said that it would be in lane 1 so to head down there. There was no bus in lane 1. Another passenger mentioned it would be lane 7 so we went there only to find out that it did not leave until 6pm and didn't know where we were going.

6:00 finally came around and a random man showed up, asked if we were waiting for a hotel and opened the bus doors. My son was pushed to the ground and his finger stepped on when the mob tried to all pile onto the bus at the same time. The person showing us to the bus did not allow the people with accessibility assistance (in wheelchairs) to board first. We did not know if there was another bus if we were not able to all fit on the first one. 

Two more buses showed up and we asked where we were going, to which we were simply told, the hotel. Had the bus flipped over and something happened to the driver, we would have all been stranded without any idea of where we were going. 

We drove for an hour and 20 minutes before reaching our destination in Toledo. We checked in and when asked about our shuttle to the airport, the desk clerk suggested that we ask the person organizing it because she had no details on our return to the airport. I had to explain that there was absolutely no organization whatsoever and she agreed to contact the company who brought us to the hotel to organize it. 

The rooms were nice enough and we were able to have two meals and upon asking again at the front desk were told that the shuttle would be there at 8am. 

8am came around and the first buses were full. I had learned my lesson with getting in line and decided to wait so that the mass could get on first to avoid getting trampled on. We got two spaces on the 3rd and last bus, which took its sweet time leaving. The driver wasn't sure everyone was on the bus. The hotel had even less of an idea if everyone had left. We urged the driver that with the 1.5 hour bus ride, we were barely going to get to the airport in time and seeing as there was no way to find out if anyone was missing, he reluctantly started driving. 

From a customer service perspective, things could have been handled so much better on Iberia's behalf to avoid frustration, confusion, injury, etc. Vouchers could have bene handed out in an organized manner. An attendant could have accompanied the group to the bus or to a designated spot for the other company to pick us up. More information could have made this a painless transition. But instead, police were called because some customers got too frustrated with non-answers and it was a stressful almost 12 hours for all of us. 

Also, it turns out that the mechanical failure had occurred the night before and the airline knew it wouldn't be fixed in time because of a lengthy process to approve the flight, yet refused to provide additional information to any of us and left us all with a bad experience.

For my partner, a tall person, legroom was average or maybe a teeny bit less for economy.What was a negative for him was that the seats where thin and not the best comfort.

The booking experience was something else. When I made the booking I wrote the name, exactly as it's written in the passport, as requested. There must be something wrong with their website because instead of the middle name being in the middle it came out after the surname. So I rang 'customer service' and was told that it would be sorted out. I checked a few days later and it was still the same, so I called 'customer service' and spoke to a woman who said it was my fault and I had to pay 30 euros or she wouldn't change the name, 'take it or leave it'.

So I paid the money, next day no change, so I called them again the next day and was told it would be changed, still no change.

Same seats as the economy class at least one in the middle is empty !
Crew : seems not happy to work there .
The worst is the level of service for a business class passenger !
Food : the product is so badly designed ,presented it looks like the economy one served years ago ! Imagine what it will be if they have to offer today some food in economy class ??

Luckily, in economy they don’t give any free meals on this flight so you can only buy it ,at least you get what you pay for, and it’s better, which is not the case in business class .

Explanation we were given was that 'Perhaps there was a plane change.'  Sure, like I'm going to believe that.  Then during flight we were served some sort of sandwich.  Mind you, I was half-asleep when served so I didn't really look to see what it was.

8.15322113037109,5.55522918701172,"Iberia Flight Delays",1,"Before flying on Iberia, I thought Spirit was the worst airline I ever used.  Iberia now takes first place. Iberia flies from Spain and to and from many Latin America countries.
My wife and I booked a flight from Barcelona, Spain to Miami, which had a stopover in Madrid.  When we got to Barcelona airport, there were no signs when you get in the terminal directing you to any airline.  So we walked all around and finally saw 2 signs with agents for Iberia.  There was about a dozen people waiting there, so we though this wasn't so bad.  After waiting there for about 25 minutes, someone walked by us and asked us where we were going. I said Madrid.  She says, """" You have to go to another area, this is the wrong Iberia area for that.""""  They were too cheap and lazy to put up a sign say this.
Then we found the right area, way down the corridor.  There was maybe 100 people waiting there.  We were waiting about an hour, when an agent from the priority line called a group of us over.  We waited on that line for about 20 minutes, and when we got to the front of the line, and the agent saw it was 9 AM and our flight was not until 12 PM, she told us to wait on the other line. We got so mad, I started yelling at another agent to help us, which she did.  Totally disorganized agents.
Then we got our tickets, which only had a letter A on the gate area.  Usually there is a letter and a number.  But I thought, hey, maybe in Spain they don't use numbers with the letter.  We walked a long way, following the signs for  """" A"""" and then saw all the gates had numbers after the letter """" A """".  I found an agent and asked him where is """" A"""", and he tells me, """" Go down all the way to the end.""""  We did, and found that """" A"""" was  """" A 1 """".  Now why didn't they put A1 on the ticket ?  Another unsolved mystery.
The flight to Madrid was uneventful.  After arriving there, we look at out tickets to Miami, and again, no gate number, only a letter """" S"""".  There a sign that says """" S"""" will be 24 minutes away.  That involved a very long walk and a train ride to the opposite end of this giant airport.  Now we think """" S"""" must be S 1 from the way these airports run here in Spain. It took about 45 minutes before we reached S 1.  When we got there was no one there. I walked to an Iberia desk far away from the gate, asked the agent where """" S """" was, and he looks at my ticket and say, """" You have to go to """" S 47 .""""  That was at the far end of that level.  I asked why the gate number was not on the ticket, and he says, """" They don't put the gate number on there, you have to find out from another agent.""""  Pure stupidity.
Now we have to walk about 20 minutes to the opposite end of that level. When we get there, there are 3 agents standing there, sort of like security, making sure no one enters that area unless they have a ticket for that gate.  I asked the agent if the tickets with no gate numbers is the way Spain operates it's airports, or is the just Iberia.  He says, """" It's just Iberia.""""
The food places at this airport was one overpriced junk place after another, so we didn't buy anything for the plane.  After all, all international flights give you two meals, and the one we came to Barcelona on , American Airlines, was decent.  But these people love their meat.  So much that you will see places carving meat from the leg of the animal, with the animal's hoof high in the air.  Disgusting for an airport.  
We had the back seats on the flight, which has it's good and bad.  At dinner time, the attendant gives my wife and I tray.  I look inside the main dish, it was nothing but some pasta and some red sauce.  Then there was a roll that was ice cold.  Then there was some kind of salad with couscous and beans, about 3 inches square, and a dried out piece of cake, about 2 inches square.  I called this attendant back, and asked her if there was something else besides pasta, and she said no and walked away. My wife and don't eat pasta, and though this was the worst meal we ever got.  It was a tray of cheap carbohydrates.  My wife asked me how people eat an ice cold roll.  I told her to sit on it, it will get warm.  I can bet my life the pilots and the attendants didn't eat this garbage.
I called over another attendant, this one a male, and asked him if there was anything else besides pasta. These attendants were all Spanish, and spoke some English.  He assumed I was an American who didn't speak Spanish.  He asked another female attendant in Spanish if they had anymore chicken, and she said there was no more.  He tells me, """" That's all we have. """"  He didn't think I understood what he asked in Spanish, but I can speak some Spanish.  Now I knew that there was a chicken dish, but they ran out of it, and gave us what they had left - the cheap carbohydrate tray.  We ate nothing.  We only drank soda and water.
About 5 hours later I went to the rear to use the bathroom and to throw out a soda can. There was a female attendant sitting there in a seat with her legs stretched out reading a newspaper, blocking me to the bathroom.  She tells me in Spanish, """" You have to stay in your seat.""""  I told her I had to use the bathroom in Spanish, and now she gives me a disgusted look because she had to sit up and move her legs to let me walk by.  This is the kind of flight attendants they have.
The bathroom in mid flight was so disgusting and dirty.  Toilet paper everywhere.  I guess these flight attendants don't have to clean, and some of these people were disgusting slobs. 
The breakfast was even worse, so we ate nothing nothing for a 9 1/2 hour flight.  Then one of my luggage straps was stolen off my bag. I contacted them and they did nothing about everything.  Forget about Iberia."

The next element was an 11 hour flight from Madrid to Lima and I can honestly say it was the worst flight I have ever had.

The seats were close together - which, for an economy flight, was not totally unexpected, so cannot be criticised.

The three cabin staff serving our side of the plane, however, were barely civil - one female attendant made a point of looking away when serving requiring her customers to intercept food and drink in mid air.

The quality of the food was extremely poor and the meals barely edible.

After about 4 hours I made a trip to the toilet, which was disgusting - The bins were overflowing and the floor was strewn with paper towels and awash with, I dread to think. 

On exiting the cubicle there were two male attendants reading newspapers - I held the door of the cubicle open and indicated the mess, the only response being shrugged shoulders.

Normally, on a long haul flight the attendants bring round water or juice every hour or so - not Iberia - although when I went to their station and asked - I was given a cup of water.

Customer care is clearly not a criteria when Iberia recruit their staff.

The return trip was equally bad although having previous experience I made sure that I did not need to avail myself of their facilities.

When we booked the trip we were unaware that BA do operate a direct flight to Lima but only on 2 days a week.

If anyone is contemplating a similar trip I strongly recommend that they arrange the dates around available BA flights as Iberia is best avoided."

The results are non acceptable for the passenger:

- why being forced to put your bag unprotected or closed properly in the cargo without prior notice with all your valuables?  

- delays at the arrival forcing you to wait for cargo compartment delivery and risks, who is going to pay for your delay?

It was perplexing to say the least, but they told us that having seat ticket on the way in doesn't mean we'll get them on the way back.

As it was, we weren't able to get on the plane we had tickets for and were directed to Iberia's compensation and rebooking desk. The lady there was quite pleasant and gave us 400 Euros each for compensation and got us onto a flight later in the day. She also gave us meal vouchers to use in the terminal. After that, she sent us up one floor to Iberia's ticket desk where we could collect our boarding passes.

We waited for five hours in the terminal before boarding an Iberia A319 Airbus that was every bit as cramped as the one we'd flown in on. Iberia took us to Berlin-Tegel airport, where we waited for another two hours for an Austrian Airlines flight to Vienna.

Sadly, the only good comments I can make about Iberia are with regards to their compensation and rebooking services. However, I suspect they may have a lot of practice handing out refunds and new tickets given how the rest of our experience went with them.

I get to Madrid and sprinted to catch the train to the C gates and made it to the gate with 15 minutes before the plane was scheduled to leave.  Another agent who lacked any customer service skills told me I was not on the connecting flight so she pointed me to the customer service booth.  I showed her my boarding pass with seat # and she didn't care.  I ended up staying overnight to get next flight out.  I tried to call Iberia customer service at the hotel and no # so I went to file a complaint through their website.  The site tries to deter you from filing a complaint with the many useless questions but I did and just saw a confirmation that they will respond asap.  Good thing I screenshot that because I never received an email from them.  I am disputing this with my bank and have them deal with this horrible airline.  Never will I fly with them again."

Overall what had been a fantastic stay in Madrid was somewhat tarnished by the Iberia Airlines experience - unorganised and rude.

He spoke glowingly of how punctual the Airline was & """"commitment of staff to be the most punctual"""" and how employees were """"the true agents in the achievement of company objectives.""""
Based on our experience and the number of poor reviews on Tripadvisor maybe the Airline needs to review it's objectives and get back to polite customer service, avoid overbooking among other customer focused goals."

People lined up as usual,  so there were long lines even before boarding. However, Iberia followed the group boarding codes, so it was an empty queue where one personnel was just letting the correct group to board first. We also have experience with group boarding in other airlines but they usually don't follow strictly the boarding order. Now comes our disappointment. The last leg (in Europe), was around 4 hours from Madrid to Stockholm. No food was served for free and not even plain water was offered. We were cramped in seats with very little legroom and that, coming from me who is only 5,2 feet tall. We had body aches coming home since we dared not fall our seats back so that the people  behind can have some space. It was quite different though, when we had Iberia operated flight  in the long haul, i.e. from JFK to Madrid. There, it was very good service, friendly stewardesses, 2 free meals, and free drinks. Also, better leg room. In summary, Iberia should consider that even if it 's a European trip where the shortest is less than an hour, thus doesn't need any food/drink; , a 4-hr European trip is quite long.

When I departed Agadir, Morocco I was given a choice to check my bag all the way through to my final destination. I was told at the ticket counter that I would need to pick up a boarding pass to the second leg of my journey when I arrived in Casablanca. Since I had 5.5 hours between flights, I foolishly thought """"no problem"""". 

When I arrived in Casablanca I was directed to a holding area in the lower levels of the airport because I did not have the boarding pass. I was told to wait at the Iberia ticket counter and someone would be down to issue the pass. There were 3 other airlines represented and staffed in the area so I thought it would not be long until a representative from Iberia showed - I was VERY WRONG!

My international flight was to depart at 12:30 local. Boarding was to start at 11:50. I waited hour, after hour and not a single person showed at the counter. There were no phones and none of the other airline personnel lifted a finger to help. Needless to say, I was quite concerned after 4 hours passed and I had no pass. Finally, at around 11:10 a rep came and issued the boarding pass. 

Bottom-line. If you are flying from Agadir through Casablanca and connecting to another airline then make sure DO NOT book your baggage all the way through to your final destination. Exit, get your checked bag and go through security. Of course, you will need to allow enough time but at least you won't be stuck in boarding pass purgatory."

If you are taking a connecting flight from Madrid (or other location I suspect) to Casablanca ensure you have at least a 2-3 hour layover between flights. The reason for this is because you likely will NOT get your bags on the flight to Casablanca. I had a little over an hour to get to my connecting flight, and while I made it fine, the bags did not. 

To add insult to injury, when I arrived in Casablanca there were no other flights that day to transport my bags so I was stuck. We spent the better part of an hour in-line at the very understaffed service counter in Casablanca. I needed to travel 45 min into the city to my hotel and then another 1.5 hours round trip to the airport and then back into the city the next day. Needless to say, my ability to see the city was shot.

While one of us had the exit row, another passenger decided to leave his seat in the back and sit in the flight attendant seat in front of me for the entire flight, encroaching into the legroom I paid extra for.  The flight attendant's had no issue with this and even served his food tray in their jump seat.  To top it off, when we arrived in Madrid, our luggage did not.  It took 2 days for us to receive our luggage.  Sent a message to Iberia and received a reply they would respond in no more than 21 days.  It's been 32 days and not a word.

It smelled as if the bathrooms were soaked in old urine and never cleaned.  Also, in the middle of the flight, our cabin crew was absent for at least 2 hours.  I used the call button to request some water for me and my family because we were parched.  After 20 minutes, I turned the call button off.  The staff were surly and unpleasant.

Didn't mention that anywhere when booking the flight on Iberia. Anyway, it was also a nice flight though we upgraded to premium economy. Meals are not included in regular economy with Level. Overall both flight were very nice, but IMO Barcelona has got to be the worst major airport I have ever been in. Poorly signed. Rude staff. Dirty dining areas. And as mentioned by others, for some bizarre reason you need to line up for security, and then line up again for a """"passport check,"""" which took twice as long as security. Luckily we got there early but there were quite a few passengers freaking out about missing their flight because of this unexpected and slow line. Then a bizarre boarding procedure where (mind you with no announcement or warning), we get to the end of the jetway while boarding, only for it to deposit us onto a bus, which took us on a ride literally to the other side of the airport, where we then got out and boarded the plane from the tarmac. Its fine if they need to do this for security or logistics, but at least warn us. Luckily we spoke Spanish, but there were many confused passengers."

They served you a 6 ounce can of beer, wine, or soda with your meal.  There were no other alcoholic drink options on both flights nor additional beer or wine offered after the meal.  We paid to reserve our seats for our journey home.  The flying experience as well as the service was much better on the return flight.  The flight on the way to Spain was a D-.  The dinner was delicious which is why I do not give them an F.  The flight home was a solid B.  I would of given them an A if they had served alcohol when requested.  Iberia does not give you cabin service like your typical airlines such as United, American, and Delta.  Having the option to be served beverages throughout the flight is very important to me especially when you are on an 8 plus hour flight.  Usually the national airline of the country you are flying to is the best in service.  In this case, I felt that Iberia was the budget of all budget airlines.  The sad thing was I could of flown with British Airways, Delta, and several other notable airlines for the same price, but chose Iberia thinking that they would offer much better service than everyone else.

My family of 4 sat in business class and my 5 years old spilled his drink on his table cloth and the flight attendant just gave me an “opps” look. She made no attempt to help him out or change the table cloth. You might ask why I as his mother did not help him out? Well he was sitting in the middle 2 seat with his 8 years old brother and I was across from his aisle. With food on my table it takes some time to get up and go over.

The seat was very narrow. I am 115lbs and 5 feet 2 so I am pretty small. I have to sleep with my hands on my belly  or else it will hang to the side of the seat.

Business Class Madrid to Miami 14th November  and Miami to Madrid 4th December 2017.

  Seating and leg room excellent. Punctual as well.
 I have flown Iberia for over 35 years and watched it´s transition from a badly run state airline to one of the most modern, efficient and enjoyable in the world. Sadly with British Airways Willie Walsh now in overall charge it is in decline with a policy of maximum profit for their shareholders at the expense of the paying passenger. The service now offered is more akin to a cut price airline than a full fare business class ticket. Gone are the fantastic menus by some of Spain´s most famous Chef´s and the meal now offered is more in line with the standard fair offered on BA - which is hardly a culinary delight.Little wonder all the sea bass was  taken by the time the purser arrived at my seat, and the choice left was pigs cheek or pasta. Good job I had a decent breakfast in the Iberia lounge before boarding! Their bodega of fine wines is no longer their boast, instead there is a mention in the meal menu that they have red and white wines and spirits. The menu states a wine list, but there was none.
 
Iberia´s introduction of their new Premium Economy class has unfortunately been to the detriment of it´s business class. One of the aft business toilets has been removed to create more room, bringing the number down to two very busy toilets which showed signs of heavy use half way through the flight. The rear toilet might be the better choice of the two to use. Gone is the orderly area aft where sandwiches and drinks were on a self service basis throughout the flight. The sandwiches are gone too and the choice on my flight was down to nuts or fruit in a plastic cup or chocolates. This service now shares the forward galley, which at times  is more like the strewn back room of a soup kitchen, with it being difficult to distinguish what is for the galley and what is self service for the passengers. However, after the meal the cabin crew did bring it to a good resemblance of order. There is simply not enough room for both. The only alternative to Miami is AA and it is not an alternative that I would look at lightly, but  more of choosing the lesser of the two evils, and one I will have to consider in the future. 

The return leg to Madrid faired much better. They must have fixed the menu as in the back of the December menu it  included three fine red wines and two excellent whites. I have a weakness for Cava and it too was excellent. This time I managed to order the sea bass with lemon parsley sauce, mashed sweet potato, red beet and green asparagus and it was excellently presented, but including a beef hamburger in the menu was rather unimaginative - unless Iberia are trying to lure American travelers with fast food!  I finished my meal with a 12 year old Flor de Cana rum on the rocks. Excellent. On this flight the aft business section had not been changed into Premium Economy and there were adequate toilets. The snacks were in their usual place and this time there were sandwiches as well as Belgian chocolates. Maybe I will have to reconsider AA as an alternative to Iberia. Better the devil you know.......

The Iberia Plus points system has also been changed and not for the better. It used to be that if you accrued some 120,000 points that was enough to have a free round business trip ticket to the USA from Madrid. Now you need some 180,000 points, and that will only get you a half price fare."

They lost my friend's luggage for hours which cost us our 1 day vacation in Madrid.  The cabin crew on the flight was just nasty, really rude.  I've never experienced such behavior.  Is that normal for Iberia? Because that's just not how things run in the world of hospitality and services.  I opted for a lactose free meal and for some reason that translated into no salt, bland, under cooked rubbery meals every time.  Whenever I asked for a regular meal they made the biggest fuss about letting me have a left over meal.  I couldn't understand why they were so rude. Those terrible meals are not what I requested.  I paid over $850 for this flight and they were beyond terrible.  I sent their senior management an email regarding the complaint and overall terrible treatment to myself and the rest of the people I traveled with and have not received a response nor do I expect to.  My family and I are planning a vacation to Spain this fall and we will certainly not fly Iberia. Never again."

Seats were comfortable, service was good, food was very good.  However, check-in online was initially not working (if this happens just keep trying - we finally were able to do this at midnight) and check-in at the airport is a fiasco.  First, the terminal is all Iberia so make sure you are in the right check-in line - read the monitors carefully (we almost made the mistake that others on our flight did by standing in a long line only to find out it was the wrong one).  From check-in to the gate it took about 1.5 hours.  After check-in you go through security, then take a monorail to passport control (it says 22 mins after security and 7 mins after passport control but we were in passport control for about 30 mins), then walk to your gate and if going to the U.S. you go through another passport control.

Once we were in Boston, the Iberia staff told that the flight had been cancelled in morning because the plane never even showed up, again our first flight was not until 2:30 PM, and that we should have been notified. However, we did not receive any notice. Obviously, if we had received timely notice, we would never have gone to Boston in the first place, as there was no point in traveling to Boston if the flight had been cancelled.  Especially after we were told that we could not get on the flight the next day either, and that no other alternative was offered. 

The staff at the airline counter were not helpful and lied to us. They sent us to other airline stating that we had been rebooked with British Airways else when was not the case. In fact, when my husband went to speak with British Airways, they said that not only had we not been booked with them, they had a flight cancelled as well, and that they gave priority to their customers. They also said that, when they have issues, they do not send their customers to Iberia or other airlines, but try to help them. 

We also had a nightmare of a time getting our luggage. We went to the Iberia Luggage counter, and they said that since they didn't have a flight that day, they couldn't not have had their luggage.  The Iberia employee said all of this without taking the time to check if they had our luggage. Moreover, they told us that American Airlines definitely had our luggage, and if they gave us any issues, we should speak with a American Airlines manager. We then went to a different terminal to see if American did, indeed, have our luggage, and they checked, and they did not. They called Iberia, and the found out that Iberia had our luggage the whole time. Then, the American employee was nice enough to go and get our luggage, although it was soaking wet when he got back about 2 hours later. 

We are very upset with the service to mention an endless amount of aggravation and deceit,  because the airline did not do their job.

They could not even tell us when the plane would actually get to Shanghai, let alone when we would be able to board. All they offered was a hotel voucher for the night in Shanghai and told us to return in 24 hours in the hopes the plane would be ready. It wasn't.

So, as am six foot two with very long legs, I paid an additional charge for a seat with extra legroom. It was only when I boarded the airbus 330 that I discovered that I had been allocated a totally different seat to the one I paid extra for. The cabin crew told me that as the flight was full there was no possibility to give me another seat. They had given me a seat with the smallest amount of legroom and insisted that I had chosen that seat. Wtf ! Why would somebody as tall as I am pay extra for the smallest seat in the house ? I have since heard that the row of seats I had chosen, facing a bulkhead with lots of legroom, are in fact often given to children. I guess they just thought putting me somewhere close was good enough. Once airborne the purser came and offered me the only other seat available, a window seat, still with very restricted legroom. So I spent fourteen bloody hours having to continually disturb the lady next to me to go walkabout to get some circulation back into my legs. She was not happy I can tell you. She demanded to know why I hadn’t booked a seat with extra legroom. I had, and I bloody well paid extra for it. The cabin crew were ok, friendly and efficient, sympathetic even. However the hot meal was stone cold. When I complained about it the stewardess simply said she would pass the message on. Nothing was done about it. Quite frankly I’d rather travel with Ryanair and that is saying something. If Iberia want to do long haul they should do it properly or get the hell out of it and leave to those who know how to do it (like British Airways for example, who do long haul brilliantly). Never ever will I do long haul with Iberia."

The seat was great and folded flat into a bed, which was well required. There were lots of little cubbyholes to put things in and a fresh blanket and pillow. What made this flight extra special was that we got engaged 5 hours into the flight (10h30m flight) with the help of who I think was the head flight attendant (she had a red shirt on and not the same uniform as the others). They made us a congratulations sign from some old flight plan maps and gave us some extra wine etc. I cannot thank them enough, they were amazing.

This was stated during purchase and confirmed in the ticket. Great! I thought.

What followed was ONE MONTH of post exchange  in which the Iberia facebook teams promised to get it right with the callcenters but eventually never succeeded.

Now let’s talk about the on board service; the flight was on time, Iberia claims it is the “Worlds number 1 on time airline”. I was relieved to see that the aircraft was an updated one and it had an entertainment system that offered somewhat of a decent selection of movies and shows, (even though some shows like “the Handmaid tale”, only offered 1 episode from an entire season), none the less, there was enough to keep me entertained in the 10 + hour flight to Miami.

During our flight we had 2 services, a lunch that was average and your basic airline food, nothing to rave about and about 1hour ½ before landing we were offered a box with a yogurt, a candy bar and a pastry, also very average. I wish there had been service in between, but other than a flight attendant walking thru the aisle offering water once and coffee another time, that was the extent of service, I believe that for a long-haul flight, this is less than adequate, there should be at least 2 drink and snack services in between meal services, especially for a transatlantic flight.

Over all, I found Iberia to be an average airline that offers a service that like many other airlines has lost its touch with its consumer. In an era where consumers demand more, I am surprised how airlines have managed to take away more and more and still make unbelievable profits all while having the worst consumer satisfaction.

Also, why is it that with economy passengers being the bulk of the airlines business, get the worst service of all? Don’t get me wrong, I don’t expect white glove service in economy, but I do expect to be treated with respect and dignity, they are paying passengers after all. Why treat them as the cattle of the transportation industry?

If airlines improved their service, even just a little, it would create positive ripples around the world, maybe passengers would enjoy flying again and instead of being angry, frustrated and on edge, causing many of todays issues, like in flight fights and or problems causing delays, plane turn arounds, people being kicked off flights, maybe we would all enjoy flying again …."

Only one meal was provided as I don’t accept that a cold roll with a bit of cheese and ham can be regarded as a meal. In between these the cabin crew rarely offered anything else. Yes, you could walk up to the galley and help yourself to some water but what were the crew doing for the majority of the flight?  As this was a daytime flight you would expect them to be a little more attentive even if was to break up the boredom.

For the second time in a week, the ground crew attempted to remove my hand luggage while I was on the air bridge metres away from the plane. without prior warning. 

I was boarding with my mother (76) and two others. We were among the first to board after priority passengers and those with children, or in need of assistance. I estimate that perhaps 40 people had boarded before we reached the door of the plane. I was approached by a member of the ground crew who attempted to relieve me of my luggage claiming that there was no more room in the overhead lockers. 

I declined to hand over my luggage and explained we had a two-hour turnaround in Madrid where we had to transfer from Terminal 4 to Terminal 1 and navigate through security. I also said I was prepared to stow the luggage at my feet if necessary but was told that was not possible, even though I had kept it there on my inward flight.

I was not being awkward for the sake of it and if I was advised while still in the departure lounge, that it may be necessary, I would have obliged if we didn't have such a tight connection. I was in no way alone in being unhappy with the way we were being treated and asked why Iberia does not act in the same courteous and professional way the likes of easyJet and KLM do. I am sure more people would have handed over their luggage if they were given the choice in advance.

As I had refused to hand over my luggage and attempted to board the plane the ground crew decided to call the police to have me removed from the flight. I waited at the door of the plane with my luggage while the remaining passengers went through the timely process of having their hand luggage removed and labelled for stowing in the hold. Once all passengers had boarded I asked if the police were coming and was told they were not and I could board with my luggage. 

When I found my seat and opened the overhead locker, I found enough space for three or four pieces of luggage. The rest of the lockers were the same, less than half full. I appreciate that sometimes it is necessary to stow hand luggage in the hold, but on this occasion it appeared to be unnecessary. Also, there are better ways of communicating this with your passengers and Iberia seem to have forgotten how to do that."

Iberia are part of the IAG group and I see parts of the behaviour within the airline that mirrors that of the rest of that group service.

After being instructed to start boarding at 10:20 for our 11:00 flight we made our way to the gate at 10:10. The gate was starting to fill with people; however, it was not immediately clear where to wait. There were approximately 7 staff members - both flight attendants and boarding staff waiting by the desk having a conversation and generally ignoring all customers. Once the doors opened to let the crew through, the remaining member of staff began checking their mobile phone. After another boarding staff member arrived they took 15 more minutes to decide what to do. After announcing the boarding the plan to board business / first class etc passenges fell apart when people just started going up and asking to board when they wanted. The result was that eventually people ignored the boarding process. On board this meant that it took longer to board the plane.

The flight itself was fine, the service from the staff was friendly and helpful. I will reluctantly fly Iberia again, but I will check other airlines and routes beforehand."

The seats and leg space was minute; very low food standards (Spain is a country with excellent food) and the worst part....the crew. On the way to Panama the crew was, at least, well mannared. They serve what they call breakfast in a box and even have the nerve to ask the passangers to put everything in the box, when finished, so that they can collect it faster. On the return flight, the crew were loud, rud and had no respect whatsoever for the passangers. We were sitting at the back of the plane, just in front of the kitchen at the tail of the plane. The crew spent the whole flight (night flight) chatting at the top of their voices, without any concern about the passangers that were trying to sleep just in front of them. The airhost on our side of the plane came down the aisle shouting: Te, ta, to, tu!!! when offering tea; answered us as if he was our longtime friend, with no respect whatsoever. It was really embarrassing to see how the crew treated the passangers. 
I know nowadays we all want cheap flights but we do not set the plane rates, the companies do and if they charge whatever they decide to charge,  the least that can be expected from any airline is a minimum standard of service and to be treated with respect and education from the crew who, at the end of the day, are there to make your flight more comfortable and ejoyable, not to take the Mickey out of you.
Having flown with many different airlines in my life, sadly, I have to say Iberia is the worst of all. They were not up to other standards in the past but to date, they are way bellow any other company and I will definitely not fly with them again if I can avoid it and, as I said at the beginning, it is really sad and embarrassing for me to have to say this about my own country´s national airline."

I explained that I don’t eat meat or diary to which they just shrugged their shoulders and told me ‘I could have one of the cabin crews apple as they’re nice like that’!!!  They didn’t even know what a vegan was!!!!!!   Then they came around with the poor drink selection and tasteless hot drinks...

I wonder if nobody already sued the airline for fraud and bodily harm. I heard so many people complaigning. Men, woman, it was really horrible.
Another negative point was that the plane was not cleaned in Madrid. There was waste from other people around my seat. Dusgusting in every way. The crew was lovely though."

On the ground:
One of our baggage was “lost” for a couple of days. There was only 1 attendant at Iberia’s lost baggage counter, and around 10-12 of us waited patiently for our turn — very glad the attendant also kept his calm and was informative.

I tried to call them for about six weeks before our departure. I dialed the US 800 number, indicated I wanted to speak English and when asked what I wanted, I said representative. I was told a representative would be with me shortly, my call would transfer, and after about two minutes, I got a click and a dial tone. This happened repeatedly.

When I checked in at the Iberia counter in Miami and the agent looked at my return date, he grinned at said, “Do you know what is happening on the 17th?” I said, “the strike and what are you going to do to help me?” He replied, “you can pay to change your ticket.” This is not acceptable and is not customer service.”

Efficient flight attendants offered basic service and acceptable meals in both Spanish and English.  In-flight entertainment was ample with an individual touch-screen monitor.  Flight statistics were available on display throughout the flight.  Ground staff in Johannesburg and Madrid was friendly and helpful.

I paid extra to ensure we have two seats in a configuration of 2:4:2 and it was money well spent.  The rows in the middle of the plane on the wing leave more space on the side due to the wider fuselage.  Leg-room was better than expected and the seats were comfortable (for airplane seats that is). I am 184 cm and 120 kg (6 feet & 265 pounds) and this was one of the best long haul flights I have had in economy class.  The seat was slightly narrow for me but by lifting the arm-rests it solved the problem.  Some rows have an additional """"casing"""" under the seats and if you sit behind that, it is impossible to straighten your leg past that.  On the return flight I opted for the same set-up but in a different row and had no such problem.  It can also be the fact that outbound was with an A330(200) and we returned with an A330(300). 

This direct flight departed on time and touched down in Madrid ahead of schedule in a few minutes short of 10 hours.

One was out of service (in maintenance). So, you would expect the flight crew to make sure the other was always clean. Not. After a couple of hours, no toilet paper, papers all over the floor.

Let´s start with the mess they did with my seating:  I bought 8 tickets to go to Geneva on January the 1st and come back to Madrid on January the 7th, since we wanted to go a bit more comfortable we booked emergency exit seats (15€ per seat), the initial plane was an A320 and some weeks before the actual flight they changed the plane to an A321, instead of keeping the emergency seats we paid for, they changed our seats and gave us regular seats. I called Iberia to fix the issue and I had literally several calls where after being told my call would be transferred to someone that would help me Iberia kept me on hold for more than an hour!! While I was on hold with one phone I called with another one and again the same thing happened!! it was beyond frustrating.

After hours of calls and them trying to fix it apparently the system wouldn´t allow to, so my only option was to make a claim to get my emergency seats money back and go on the new seats assigned. One day later they called me to see if I wanted an upgrade for 4 of the 8 tickets I bought to business for 40€ each, I said yes. Then they did 9 charges of upgrade!!! how does that even work if I bought 8 tickets and they were offering me 4 seats?!?

Again, I called to fix the situation and after hour upon hour on hold the only solution was to make a claim to get the money of the 5 extra seats back.... to make the situation even funnier they called me a day later to offer me the seats I had already bought.

When I booked, I made my reservation with my platinum card so all of the tickets had fast track and priority boarding, but after all this issues Iberia messed it up even more and the day of the flight we found out Iberia splitted the reservations and now 6 out of the 8 tickets didn´t have fast track nor priority booking, I tried to explain them when doing the baggage drop at the airport but they were unable to fix it.

The flight itself as it happens with Iberia was uncomfortable with super limited space, the seat in front of me was compressing my knees (I´m a little over 190 cm so tall but not crazy tall). Like always Iberia selling low cost space and service at premium prices... 

On the way, back from Geneva the emergency seats were free!! How is that even possible!! I pay for them, they messed it up and changed my seats, they tell me they can´t give me the emergency seats and that I have to do a claim to get my money back and then I see that the seats are empty, seriously Iberia?!

The business class flight on the way back was mediocre, the only highlight was a decent burger and that’s about it."

When I booked my flight with Expedia they reported that the plane would be an Airbus A340-500 which has 2 engines. I find flying very boring and the only interesting thing is looking out of the window to see the land (or islands) we’re flying over. For that reason I logged on to SeatGuru to check out the seating. SeatGuru (part of the TripAdvisor group) told me Iberia didn’t have any A340-500s and they suggested that the plane might actually be an A340-600 which is a longer plane with 4 engines and a different seating plan. Despite several emails and enquiries to both Expedia and Iberia I was told the plane was definitely A340-500. When I did the online check-in I was shown the seating plan for the smaller plane and chose a seat which would give a clear view of any ground below. The plane turned out to be the larger plane and my seat gave me an excellent view of the top of the wing for the whole of the 11 hour flight. No fun, especially when I’d been looking forward to seeing the Andes mountains from above. Fortunately on the return flight the plane actually was an A340-500 (Ciudad de Mexico), although the safety leaflets in the pockets behind the seats were all for the different, larger, plane which has a vastly different layout and 10 emergency exits whereas the A340-500 has only 8.

I was very pleased with my choice to fly and to upgrade.

Good Spanish wines were a bonus...the food was good - though perhaps not up to the standard of the best Business Class offers from other airlines.

What I like about this carrier is the cheerful mood. Partly due to the staff and somewhat to the fact that most travelers are holidaymakers. The flight is short, at least according to our standards, since we used to have 10+ hours flights. Roughly 3 hours “flies” away quickly, everyone can survive that, even those who do not like this mode of transport. The trip doesn’t provide entertainment and no freebies either. If you want to eat or drink BYO or pay for it. Since we have access to the business lounge, it isn’t a problem for us, because in between the two flights in Madrid, at the Iberia lounge we can have a few bites and a drink.

I can say fully convinced that nowadays low-cost airlines offer the exact same service than the classic big airlines. I would only make an exception with KLM as they still offer a great service, offer drinks and snacks and always employ very professional crew members.
Iberia, sadly, is trying to lower their costs but they are not doing it on the right way in my opinion. The extra money, that can be some times double the price of a low-cost airline, can't be felt in the service quality. Easyjet aircraft cabins have been refurbished and are the same level today. The crews are usually rude and feel """"superior"""" to their low-cost colleagues.
Also low-cost have very fast turnaround times and that makes them push a lot to be on time, while Iberia or Air France have usually longer turnaround times and tend to leave late. 
I'd also like to point out that customers of classic airlines are usually either snobby or uneducated people. I believe these people thinks that a low-cost airplane is not maintained or not taken care of, and might fall from the sky during flight. You can feel straight away that low-cost companies are attracting more open minded people and young people that make the boarding and un-boarding process a lot smoother, the flight quieter and more pleasant and don't complain so much as they know that they're paying for a low cost service. In classic airlines customers are arrogant, not used to fly and complain for everything, as they might be expecting a premium service that it's not longer offered by these companies.

When I opened my tray it had not been cleaned. Complaining to cabin crew was worthless. They just shrugged. I cleaned it myself and asked them to take away the sanitiser cloth I used. Another shrug. Had to dispose of it myself in the end. 
Charm school would do nothing to improve the crew's attitude. Speaking politely and smiling at them elicited nothing but more rudeness. Not really sure what they are paid for exactly, but being optimistic I kept trying to smile and see what happened.
It must have been a really bad day for them as the crew that we had on the return leg were much nicer, friendlier and helpful. Cabin was still dirty though. I know they have tight turn arounds to cater for, but the numbers of cleaners that got off the flight should have meant cleanliness at the very least.
Seats were fairly comfortable considering the long journey. Meals were nothing to complain about, standard airline fare. Drinks were not served often enough and we resorted to just going and getting one when we felt like it. At least the staff didn't object to that.
Would use them again if I had to and the price was right.
I did like the bidding option on the upgrades. More airlines could use this method. We managed to get an upgrade for a short flight on our return journey and it was well worth the price. It was a shame that we werent able to get the upgrade on the long leg of the journey as it would have been interesting to see if the cabin crew were able to raise more of a smile in the business class part."

Always on Economy class and with one stop/connection in Madrid. Never had any trouble, and never seen anyone have any. My choice to Iberia was always based on the price versus what they offer, and price was always the best, the service always equal and better than the competition I experienced before (British, TAP, TAM and the dreadful Swissair). The food is just fine, with 2 options on Economy class (You can also request something different using they website before the flight), enough drink options and the breakfast is just delicious. On-board entertainment is complete, movies, music, TV series, new and classics at your front in some kind of Tablet with touch screen. Wifi and GSM available for a price, never tested GSM, but my last trip I experienced the worst Wi-Fi connection ever, 6 months ago was perfect. The seats are very comfortable, the space between seats is the same as every other company I used, blanket and pillow offered are good. Everything is well cleaned and looks/feels brand new. Attendants are very nice and always happy to help. In all the flights, there was never any delay, and sometimes arrived earlier. On land the service depends on local people, so that is hard to judge, but despite that, I was always treated like I was with a first class ticket on my hands. One detail that is quite good to me, is that I can travel with two 32KG bags if you have a Iberia Plus card (its free and very easy to get). For the last 6 years I always buy the tickets from Iberia.com, as they are cheaper and way easy to buy than in any other agency.
I just traveled from Brazil to Portugal 2 days ago (03/12/2017), payed the all trip with Iberia Plus points."

It was supposed to have a 1:40 layover in Madrid and then onto Florence, Italy by about 2pm Italy time. Typical overnight trans-Atlantic flight. Well- when we got to Madrid we naturally had to be processed thru EU Customs -with about 200 other travelers. Like I said, a 1:40 layover but the Customs took 1:55. We missed our connection to FLR and Iberia was shrug-shouldered useless. They KNEW 45-60 people on that flight from JFK were tied up in Customs. Why didn’t they hold the flight? Why didn’t they put us on a faster, shorter line?  Why did they -through their negligence- purposely strand us in Madrid?  The resulting scene at the “customer service” kiosk was horrendous. “You can come back tomorrow and fly to FLR standby”, was their only no-extra-charge-offer. And that offer did not include an over night hotel room. To avoid wasting one or two added days enroute to our vacation, we eventually opted for the only other flight to FLR - via Dusseldorf.  That’s right - If we didn’t want to pay for an over night stay in Madrid (plus meals) and MAYBE get a flight to FLR the next day - or maybe the NEXT day - we would have to pay for an additional side trip to Dusseldorf - and from there to FLR. A detour of 9 hours. Iberia offered nothing better. No discount. No consideration at all. Our vacation was salvaged for the cost of the extra flights and a belly full of aggravation."

This is an overnight flight, so if you have no trouble sleeping in planes, it will be great to arrive rested and ready for the action.
Even on economy class, this flight provides good food and drink, good legroom in your seat and if you are lucky, you might even score a row of seats just for you.  Does not happen often, but it does happen.
Service in general is above average (when compared to most airlines in America) and it should be a quite enjoyable flight."
5.92728281021118,9.02092361450195,"Iberia Flight Review",3,"Iberia seats in business class are perfect, with everyone having access to the aisle. Food can be improved but is good. Iberia has a standard service for dining on board that makes no sense... you will have the same meals independently of the length of the flight. It’s the same going to JFK (less than 8 hours) or going to EZE or SCL (more than 11 hours). 
Staff can be rude, they are always in a hurry, doing more important things than taking care of passengers. There is not flexibility in the on board service... you have to eat when they so decide, not later."
7.09516286849976,7.56356382369995,"Airplane Bathroom Issues",1,"I've flown 20 times this year, many times with budget airlines, but my experience with Iberia has to be the worst.  The boarding process was chaotic and delayed.  The inflight entertainment was minimal.  The quality of the food was poor.  The flight attendants were rude.  I was asked to close the toilet door by one of them whilst I was walking past even though I hadn't been the one using the toilet and she was just sat their reading the paper.

In theory there is a choice of meals, but the flight attendant decided to give one to me without asking.

Concluding the experience with Iberia was a delayed suitcase, which meant I missed my bus as I had to wait for an hour and a half until after my flight landed for the case to arrive.

Go to Quito but avoid Iberia!"

The service was better than on my other flights to Madrid, although the food was so-so.  Iberia flies to terminal 4 in MAD, which puts me directly at the entrance to the Metro.  All in all a pretty good experience."

Oh yes, you may take a shower if you wish, towels and hair dryer provided!
That was a good start but don’t forget to leave a space for the excellent meal served aboard.
The new business class seating are well distributed, our seat was 3E and 3G, spacious and very comfortable with some privacy due to its layout, may recline 180。and one good thing is you may place a tag for do not disturb so you are not awaken for meal or snacks during your sleep!
Unfortunately turbulence persisted almost for the entire flight.

On board services we have received from other airlines such as hot face towels  did not exist. In the past I have received better on short haul flights. On a 9 hour flight we were given one hot meal (fairly standard airline platter plus a very  tiny cheese and ham  sandwich and coffee about 4 hours later and a breakfast that was again cheese and ham, yoghourt and a chocolate bar , although this time it was a breadroll, about 2 hours before landing. Not by any means the best of fare. We had to pay for any food or dinks on the flights from Manchester to London and London to Madrid"
8.9938497543335,5.74068784713745,"Iberia Flight Delays",1,"Well, so far this planned holiday has not happened. Using an online flight search, we came upon a decently priced option through Carlton Leisure - booking in September for a holiday next Easter. All done and dusted, we thought.
Then, in November, the wheels came off. Iberia made a schedule change which saw our return flights having to change. This was fixed by using a BA flight but then it was noticed (by ourselves, not Carlton Leisure) that the Madrid to Johannesburg outward bound flight had changed to leaving Madrid almost 19 hours before we were due to fly from London! 
After several emails and onlince chats it was found that Iberia had brought in a schedule change and could not accommodate us on our planned outward journey. They offered a flight earlier which we could not take (due to work commitments) and seemed to think that was enough. 
Funnily enough, the return flight was changed from Iberia to BA to get us home but that was not, apparently, thought of for the outward bound. The result? No flights and we are hoping for  refund so we can start again. Definitely not my choice of airline"

Madrid to Faro and Faro to Madrid with. Air Nostrum, smaller plane more legroom. Pleasant scheduled flights.
Madrid to LHR had prtebooked emergency exit seats (flight scedule change allowed me to do this for free otherwise overpriced) good legroom, made the return a far more pleasant experience.
Overall I would not choose to fly with Iberia again unless I had the emergency exit seat. Air Nostrum on the other hand was fine.
Honestly Easyjet is better!!"

3.77658891677856,2.66376256942749,"Flight Attendant Issues",3,"As a former PPL (Privat Pilot Licence) i always follow with interest what´s happening during a flight.  Flying has always been my passion and  I had the priviligue to ride in the cockpit of a big airliner on many occasions. But also the average performance in the cabin catches my attention. """"The cabin crew is here for your safety"""", is a common phrase during preparation of a flight announced via the P/A system. On this particular flight, we had a normal flight from Madrid to London. But upon landing the aircraft had to wait temporarily for a parking gate, as it was occupied by another aircraft about to depart.  As it often  happens, in the moment the aircraft came to a halt, half of the passenger in my section of the big A340 raised and opened the overhead bins, despite the fact that the seatbelt sign was not yet turned off.and it was obvisously that the aircraft hadn´t reached it´s parking area. In fact, it had stopped far away in order not to block for other passing traffic. The cabin crew did intervene only after lots of the luggage from the overhead compartments had been removed by the standing passengers in the aisle. Then the aircraft started to taxi towards the parking gate, apprx 4-5 minutes away. The doors for the overhead bins remained open during the entire rest of the taxi, as did the luggage standing in the aisle. Now you may think that this is nothing to talk about. But keep in mind that the greatest aircraft accidents during ll times have happened on the ground, not in the air. To certify a new type and model  the manufacturer needs tio demonstrate that the aircraft can be evacuated within 90 seconds. This is a rigid and necessary ruel which is performed without exception. The cabin crew in this particular flight did not do their job and should have phoned the capatin to tell him wait until they have replaced the luggage back, closed the locks, and brought the passengers back to their seat. Instead the aircraft continued with the aisles blocked, passengers standing in line and the overhead compartments completely opened.   Upon leaving the aircraft I made a remark about this to the chief flight attendant, who´s only response was to be arrogant. My impression of Iberia is after this lttle incident not the best. My experience is that if you see several flaws within an airline, certainly there are a lots of others hidden that you cannot see."
5.00708341598511,8.01981925964355,"Iberia Flight Review",4,"I struggled to find any direct flights when we looked to fly to Havana even though I have been led to believe that Virgin fly direct there, so booked BA/Iberia via Madrid.  I was a little apprehensive as I had not flown long haul with Iberia before and their short haul flights tend to be basic and on fairly tired aircraft much of the time.  Some of the reviews of their flights were also not great.

However, the flights were on relatively new airbus aircraft with good entertainment systems and USB charging points in all the seats. The leg room was a bit tight, but the seats were reasonably comfortable and we particularly appreciated the adjustable height headrests that were a big help when you were trying to get comfortable.  There was a good choice of films and TV to watch and the flight-tracking function was good too. 

My only complaints were that firstly, despite being booked through British Airways the whole way through, neither BA or Iberia would let us check-in for the whole journey or see our seats on the Iberia legs of the trip online. Secondly the layout of the aircraft cabin meant that there was very little room if you wanted to stand up and stretch or walk a little.  The galley area at the rear had surprisingly limited space and it felt a little hemmed in, especially given the 11 hour outward bound flight."
