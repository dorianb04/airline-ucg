6.49306678771973,10.210467338562,"Emirates Luxury Travel",4,"I used Emirates new Premium Economy class. Obviously """"Premium Economy"""" is not business, It is situated on the first deck, in front of economy sections. Headsets are the same with economy class. It reclines but it is no shell seats, so once everybody reclines seats, for those who are not on the aisle it becomes very difficult to get out e.g. to go to washroom. However, on positive side, I found new seats well constructed with leather upholstery, foot rest comes up high enough to feel the support, the premium economy section  was very quiet away from engines (plus it is airbus A380), food was very good and most probably upgraded from economy menu, dedicated toilets were never too busy,  and it comes will small overnight kit off socks, eye masks and toothbrush. Of course IFE was vast and I liked interactive map system, too. Overall, it is a good choice to add extra comfort from Economy Class."

I suffer from a condition called Adenomyosis, this is a condition that unfortunately has good days as well as bad. I have never experienced a ‚Äúreally‚Äù bad day whilst travelling and unfortunately this occurred on my flight home and I wasn‚Äôt equipped with the right medication (total carelessness on my part and lesson learned for future travel). I didn‚Äôt think I was going to be able to travel home due to the pain I was enduring but the staff at eremites made me feel so comfortable, they allowed me to go to the toilet whilst the seatbelt sign was on and also helped me whilst being sick, which I honestly can‚Äôt thank them enough for doing as being sick in a public setting is horrendous at the best of times let alone on a flight. They also managed to source me pain relief and checked up on me every hour as well as asking various health questions in case I started feeling worse. Honestly cannot thank them more from the bottom of my heart. Also side note to thank Dubai airport for allowing us to travel via buggy to our gate as I could no longer walk as I had lost feeling in my legs and was close to losing consciousness due to pain levels. Again I cannot thank everyone enough as it was a very scary and traumatic experience which was made much easier due to the kindness and care that was given."

The AC is too high and most of the passengers are freezing cold. The food is so basic and not well presented. No desirable snacks, so tight in terms of offerings. The Ice selection is so bad when it comes to TV series and movies. The latest movies are so bad so why can Emirates not add more movies from the past - more award winning, more classics and more choice of tv series! Mad Men, The Affair, Little White Lies.. It really isn‚Äôt worth the value in money at all. It‚Äôs so bad. If i could, i would travel with other airlines that don‚Äôt take you for a ride for money! Thanks for giving me a cold for XMAS!"

The service provided by our cabin crew member, Bithika, during the Dubai to Dhaka flight was nothing short of excellent. Bithika took great care of our daughter, ensuring her comfort throughout the journey. She even arranged a child meal, despite our daughter primarily eating pur√©es, and showered her with plenty of thoughtful gifts.
As first-time parents traveling in economy class, we were initially apprehensive, but Bithika‚Äôs exceptional care and attentiveness made our journey smooth and enjoyable. We truly appreciate her efforts. Thank you!"

Unfortunately, this time did not reflect the standards I usually have for Emirates. First of all the flight attendants were very passive aggressive anytime I would ask for something, there was only one woman with short brown hair who was very sweet and very helpful and honestly made this flight slightly more bearable. Service was slow you would wait 20-30 mins if you rang the service button and once you did the flight attendant would come to you like they were annoyed at the fact that you called them. Second of all the food was absolutely disappointing, I found 2 hairs in my food, one blonde one and one long black one (i have brown hair and it was braided and away from my food so it couldn‚Äôt have been mine) the food was edible but really not so good and once I got home from my flight I stayed up vomiting all night, safe to say I am really disappointed as me and my family have been long time customers of Emirates and I would never have expected this experience and to be treated this way. I have another flight in 10 days with Emirates and for the copious amount of money I payed for these tickets I truly hope my experience is a lot better than this and that I won‚Äôt have to write another bad review."

And I would like to make a complaint 

Before getting in the aircraft, I was stopped from the dubai airport Emirates staff to charge me for extra weight for my carry-on luggage, after I paid the extra baggage 830aed , after that when I returned to security scan, the staff that was holding my flight tickets left his position for a few minutes, increasing my stress for the onboarding. 

When I got to the aircraft, the earphones didn‚Äôt work, i needed to use my own because the plug was completely broken.

And then no one gave me a menu, and all the options were just said on spot, remember and choose the options.

For the entry I already got the wrong order, they gave me the lobster option, I don‚Äôt eat fish seafood since I born, I complained and it was changed

Not only that, for the main meal I ordered the beef, and I was served shrimp, but this time, it was said the beef was gone, and all the other options are not things that I eat too. 

So I end up not eating my main or anything, if I‚Äôm not mistaken I added an observation on my profile explicitly saying that I don‚Äôt eat seafood. 

I  just got a mini chocolate as a form of apology and a mini mac and cheese.

Paying for this expensive service, paying extra money for the luggage and not receiving a good service is reeeeeally disappointing."

Upon arriving at Jeddah Airport on December 12, one of our four checked bags was missing. Despite immediately reporting this and providing our contact details, we received no updates or assistance.

We followed up multiple times, providing our details again, yet Emirates failed to contact us or resolve the issue. It took four days of back-and-forth communication, and only with the help of our agent were we finally able to retrieve the missing bag. By that time, all the food items in the bag had spoiled, causing a significant financial loss as we had to purchase food unexpectedly during our stay.

This experience has been deeply disappointing. Emirates‚Äô lack of responsiveness and inefficiency is unacceptable, especially for an airline of its reputation. I expected far better service and support. Unfortunately, this ordeal has left me with no confidence in flying with Emirates again.

5.37758779525757,5.4456992149353,"Emirates Airline Hospitality",1,"I have so much hatred for Emirates. Supposedly one of the best airlines in the world, yet their cabin crew are quite possibly the most egotistical, ignorant, rude and obnoxious individuals you could ever come across. They have zero care for your comfort during a flight and seem more interested in getting to the end of their days. As one with a nut allergy I have had the displeasure of flying Emirates 4 times and each time I am left more and more disheartened by their product. The latest example of this was asking for an allergen chart (not hard, many other airlines offer this), and was told they did not hold one, but did say that """"everything has nuts in it - I can offer you an apple"""". What a load of BS. In contrast I once flew Virgin Atlantic who did state they had nuts in the Economy class meal service, but their solution was to get me a meal from Upper class to ensure I was kept, y'know, alive. 

The cabin crew even had the nerve to tell me that I should have pre-booked a nut free meal - to which I said, """"your website and call center refuses this option"""" to which she just smiled and went, """"yeh, thats true"""". I did ask if someone sat in Business or First had a nut allergy if they would be greeted with this snarky reply - """"no sir, they'd have a very different service"""". Ugh. 

You get what you pay for, and Emirates is the runt of the litter."

On other airlines the same level of service would have been Excellant but with high expectations it was only Very Good. Picky - maybe - but the real let down was the food, not so much it‚Äôs service but its preparation and presentation. The fish course for dinner and the omelet for breakfast were spoiled by the serving plate being jammed to overflowing with unpalatable side dishes - spoiling what a simple serving of fish and omelet would would have offered. The tray service at both meals was so small that drinks had to be set on the side arm of the chair  - and guess what -  they got knocked over and spilt. Given the number of cabin attendants and the length of the journey, plate servings, not tray servings, would have presented better service. The second disappointment was seating in the aft lounge area which was very limited and far from comfortable. Otherwise the seating was the most comfortable with a full length stretch out for. 6 ft. 3in. person. The bedding was soft, warm and comfortable. The cabin attendants friendly, helpful and efficient - although the service was slow and no second cocktails were offered. Altogether the edge of excellence was missing and maybe the hype led to undue expectations - but at prevailing price levels it was disappointing."

Finally contacted my financial institution to assist.  Purchased the round trip business class for over $7800 not realizing that the website had reset. Ended up with a ticket for one month earlier than intended.  Called Emirates in less than 24 hours to have them correct it for me.  They did nothing for me and instead of helping, charged me an additional $1300 to change the flight to the correct date.  I asked about the grace period as airlines have a period of some sort that you can make changes to your booking without penalties, especially if it's a business class ticket and was told that the 24hr grace period is only for U.S. customers.  I find this unacceptable, discriminating and just a money grab.

The aircraft we flew on (B777-300ER and A380) were modern, clean and well appointed, and can't have been more than 5 years old.
The inflight entertainment is very comprehensive with a vast selection of films, tv shows, podcasts and music.

December 11 I left Indonesia for Greece. On the flight from Indonesia to Dubai he had scrambled eggs for breakfast, causing me to get food poisoning. After the plane arrived in Dubai, I was sick to my stomach. We got on the next flight from Dubai to Greece (Athens) and the food poisoning I got from the Emirates scrambled egg started getting worse and I had non stop vomiting, diarrhea, 3 fainting spells, 39.5 fever. When I initially called the flight attendant for my turn, she told me to get a bag in front of me and throw up, but when they realized it was serious they tried to help by putting cold towels on my face. I immediately asked them for a doctor because my condition was very bad and they told me that there is no doctor. Inadmissible! 
To have paid so much money to this airline with so many flying hours and their unacceptable food and not have a doctor to examine me better. Besides I didn't have a doctor, I just asked for something to stop my vomiting and they didn't even have the pill. It is truly the worst airline I have ever flown."
3.08897018432617,4.45431756973267,"Emirates Flight Attendance",1,"I am incredibly disappointed with the treatment my family and I received on our recent Emirates flight, especially considering the significant amount we paid to upgrade to business class. We chose Emirates based on its reputation for excellent service, but this experience was nothing short of a nightmare.

We paid an additional $12,000 AUD for business class, hoping for a more comfortable and thoughtful experience, but instead, we were met with unnecessary stress and unprofessional behavior. At the gate, the staff told us our infant son could ‚Äúruin the flight for others‚Äù if he cried, which felt completely inappropriate and lacking in empathy. Traveling with three young children, including an infant, is already challenging, and the constant pressure from the staff to ‚Äúhurry up‚Äù only made things worse. As a result, our children became upset, and our infant son had an accident and soiled his nappy.

When my wife approached the gate staff to explain the situation, one staff member cruelly said, ‚ÄúThis is why you don‚Äôt have kids.‚Äù This callous remark was not only unprofessional, but deeply hurtful, and reflected a complete lack of respect or understanding. It was an incredibly insensitive and dismissive comment that set the tone for the rest of our experience.

Things didn‚Äôt improve when we arrived at the lounge. My wife, showing her boarding pass and trying to find a place to change our baby, was told she would need to pay to access the lounge. While I understand lounge access might not be included, after spending $12,000 AUD on business class, we expected more compassion and flexibility, especially considering there were no other available facilities to care for our infant.

Rather than receiving understanding or kindness, we were made to feel like an inconvenience. The entire experience left us feeling harassed and emotionally drained, which significantly impacted what should have been a positive start to our family holiday. The lack of empathy and respect we received was truly shocking, and it has caused us to seriously reconsider flying with Emirates in the future.

I am left questioning whether this is the level of service Emirates truly stands for. I expect a formal apology and assurances that this kind of treatment will not be tolerated in the future. This experience was not just disappointing; it was distressing, and I hope that it will be addressed for the sake of other families traveling with young children."

I appreciate that after Covid, Emirates cut back on a lot of services, however started to charge more and had one of the most profitable years. 
However what about customers? There is a big mismatch between the brand promise and level of service, specially when it comes to food both in their DXB lounge and on flights. I took about 10 business class flights over the past 2 years, the food is absolutely disgusting to the point I started to bring my own. End of November I was in the business lounge, there was absolutely no food options.. everybody were sitting with empty plates. The food was low quality, smelt bad, super triple oily or deep friend, you would struggle to fish out any meat, and zero healthy options.

 Like almost no salads or fruits.. The vegetables that are available are dried out and sad looking.. On the flight was not any better, the fish had such strong fishy smell that I felt like throwing up.. my return flight from Glasgow, I did not touch the served chicken and rice, it was super dry, stinky and looked like it was already microwave  5 times before..

Emirates
I am writing to formally express my dissatisfaction with the service I received during my recent flight with Emirates. This was my second time flying with your airline, and unfortunately, it will be my last due to the disappointing experience.

Flight Details:
* Flight Number: EK 431
* Date of Travel: 6 December

Issuessssss ::

1. Seat Change Without Notification:‚Ä®I had specifically selected and paid for a preferred seat during the booking process. Upon checking in at the counter, I was not informed about any changes to my seat or the aircraft configuration. It was only after boarding that I realized my seat had been changed to one at the back of the aircraft. This lack of communication was both unprofessional and unacceptable.
2. In-Flight Discomfort:‚Ä®The seat I was reassigned to was extremely uncomfortable and located in a part of the cabin where the conditions were less than satisfactory. The high noise levels, and proximity to high-traffic areas made the entire flight an unpleasant experience.
3. Customer Service Response:‚Ä®When I raised these issues with the staff at the airport and onboard, their response was dismissive and unhelpful. Instead of offering a solution or support, I was told that I could leave the flight if I was unhappy, but no further assistance would be provided. This response, particularly for a passenger traveling alone with two young children, was disappointing and unacceptable.
4. Lack of Communication at Check-In:‚Ä®As a mother traveling alone with two children, it was incredibly stressful to deal with such unexpected changes without prior notice. Had not been informed at the check-in counter or via email about the changes to my paid seat selection, I could have prepared or sought an alternative solution. The lack of communication reflects poorly on your service standards.
Resolution Requested:‚Ä®I kindly request:
1. An explanation for why my seat and aircraft change were not communicated to me during check-in or via email.
2. Assurance that Emirates will improve its processes to ensure that such changes are communicated to passengers promptly in the future.
3. A commitment to train staff to handle such situations with more empathy and professionalism, especially for passengers traveling with young children.
While I am willing to let Emirates keep the amount I paid for the seat selection, I sincerely urge you to consider how such situations impact travelers. As a passenger who trusted Emirates for its reputed service, this experience was deeply disappointing and frustrating.

Please address my concerns promptly and professionally."

We stood in a queue outside the terminal for probably an hour in subzero conditions until eventually we simply got on a coach that had empty seats and hoped for the best. Well, no one seemed to know what we were supposed to be doing.

After nearly an hour on the road we arrived at a hotel in Reading. Were there no hotels closer? No idea! In complete contrast the hotel was extremely organised and within minutes we were in a room and trying to recover.

We were all advised to be ready for a ‚Äúprompt‚Äù pick up at 1pm the following day. The coach finally turned up at 1:30pm. Actually, two coaches and again chaos!!! No direction, bags and people being moved from one coach to another and eventually after 15 ‚Äì 20 minutes we finally left. So much for a 1pm pickup.

At the airport, again no direction or advice so we went to the special assistance counter and got in the queue to check in again. We checked with an Emirates staff member that we were in the right place and we were advised we were. When we got to the front of the queue, 30 minutes later, we were told we weren‚Äôt in the right place. Voicing our dissatisfaction, we were taken to the correct place, but were unceremoniously placed at the end of a ‚Äúmassive‚Äù queue, despite clearly needing special assistance.

We eventually checked in and got assistance to the gate. Due to all the delays, we were grateful to get to the gate quickly and had only a short wait before boarding. There was still a significant queue behind us for check in.  How people faired behind us I couldn‚Äôt say.  Unsurprisingly though, one of our bags didn‚Äôt make it and finally turned up two days later.

For a 12+ hour journey from Toronto to Dubai, Emirates decided to grace us with what seemed like one of their oldest aircraft, probably on its retirement farewell tour. While their fleet selection is their prerogative, the seat spacing in economy redefined """"cramped"""" in a way that even sardines in a can would empathize.

It didn‚Äôt stop there. Passengers were free to store their cabin baggage wherever they pleased, which left me with no overhead storage space. The result? My cabin baggage ended up on my lap and under my feet for the entirety of the 12-hour flight. Comfort? Forget it. Personal space? Who needs it, right?

The claustrophobia compounded when I needed a glass of water due to acid reflux. Being wedged in the window seat, I hit the assistance button, only to wait an hour before a flight attendant finally arrived. Rather than addressing my need, I was rudely told to turn off the call light. When I explained my situation, I was told passengers must retrieve their own water, no matter the inconvenience. So there I was, with a bag under me, a bag on my lap, and the added hurdle of waking the elderly passenger next to me to navigate the narrow aisle‚Äîall for a glass of water. The crew eventually apologized, but it felt more robotic than sincere, as they were apparently too busy ‚Äúpreparing‚Äù for food service. Preparing, for an hour. And the Emirates welcome video asked us to call them anytime and they'd be happy to help, talk about double standards. 

Speaking of food service, coffee was served sans sugar. That‚Äôs fine, but when I requested sugar, they assured me they‚Äôd bring it, only for my coffee to grow cold as I waited in vain. When I handed the untouched coffee back, no one even bothered to ask why. At that point, I had given up hope of receiving anything resembling decent service.

Technology onboard wasn‚Äôt much better. Most USB ports didn‚Äôt work, and the touch screen was so unresponsive that it chose a movie for me. I decided to let the screen have its way because, clearly, arguing with Emirates‚Äô tech was as futile as expecting service from the crew.

And the cost for this gem of an experience? A whopping CAD 5,300 for a round trip. Now, I dread my return flight on December 31st, 2024. Ringing in the new year in a flying sardine can with apathetic cabin crew isn‚Äôt exactly how I envisioned starting 2025.

Leg 1: Cape Town to Dubai (EK773)
This was the highlight of the trip. The flight attendants were friendly and accommodating, making the long 9-hour journey more bearable. I appreciated being allowed to access snacks at the back of the plane. However, the meals were underwhelming and could use improvement. The onboard WhatsApp service worked fine on this flight, but that was the only consistent positive throughout the journey.

The stark drop in service was immediately noticeable. The flight attendants were unfriendly, unapproachable, and lacked any semblance of warmth. No smiles, no welcoming demeanor‚Äîjust a cold and dismissive attitude. Adding to the frustration, the complimentary WhatsApp service I was entitled to as a Blue Skywards member didn‚Äôt work at all. It felt like the standards Emirates is known for were non-existent on this flight.

Leg 3: Bali to Dubai (EK369)
This was the worst part of the journey. The flight attendants were outright rude, lacking professionalism or basic courtesy. One attendant nudged me to hand over the menu, saying nothing and not even attempting a smile. The Wi-Fi was non-functional, leaving me without the promised connectivity for the entire 9-hour flight.

Asking for a snack felt like an imposition, with staff visibly annoyed by the request. The meals were beyond average, lacking in quality or taste. I even mentioned to one attendant how unfriendly they seemed, but this was met with indifference.

Emirates failed to deliver on its promise of a premium experience. The service was inconsistent, with a noticeable decline in professionalism and hospitality across the flights.

The flight attendants‚Äô dismissive behavior and lack of basic courtesy were shocking for an airline of this caliber.

The thing of it was that it was not something that was made clear when purchasing - it may have been noted there in some fine print, but definitely not clarified at the time of purchase.  In any case an airlines which will nickle and dime their business class passengers for lounge access clearly does not have the right mindset about customer service, and that is reflected in other aspects too, like the attitude of crew to go above and beyond, simple attention to details, cleanliness, etc etc etc. I would only fly Emirates if absolutely necessary.

I boarded Emirates Flight EK 383 from Hong Kong to Dubai, but before boarding, I began experiencing shortness of breath, headache and wheezing. These symptoms worsened after take-off, and soon my oxygen levels dropped significantly. I felt dizzy and struggled to breathe, convinced that I was bidding farewell to life.

Fortunately, the airline crew acted swiftly. They immediately contacted a doctor on the ground, and I was given supplemental oxygen throughout the 7.5-hour flight. Additionally, asthma inhalers were provided. The crew carried an oxygen cylinder with them and monitored my condition every 10 minutes, providing continuous care and reassurance.

Travel delays and pathetic inbound service while I was travelling with my 2 toddlers and Mrs. On return journey, they lost my kids trike.

My experience with Emirates is definitely the worst of my life with any company. Paying them thousands of pounds for tickets while Emirates lacking the basics of dealing with customer with dignity, lacking basic customer service skills, their attitude is sickening. I would avoid them in future at any cost as in my opinion based on my experience, they are irresponsible and incompetent.

Review of Emirates Experience

I recently flew with Emirates and unfortunately, the experience fell short of the high standards I had come to expect. Here are some key points of concern:

	1.	Broken Stowage Compartment: Upon boarding, I found that the overhead stowage compartment above my seat was broken, which caused inconvenience as I had to place my carry-on farther away. While the crew was polite, no immediate solution was offered.
	2.	Vegan Catering: As a vegan traveler, I was extremely disappointed with the in-flight meal. The vegan option was laughably inadequate‚Äîthree pieces of asparagus and four small spoonfuls of couscous do not constitute a balanced or satisfying meal. For an airline that prides itself on exceptional service, this felt like a glaring oversight.
	3.	Coffee Quality: The coffee served during the flight was unpleasantly bitter and undrinkable. Given Emirates‚Äô reputation for premium service, this was disappointing.
	4.	Security Screening Experience: Just before boarding, I was subjected to a random security scan along with two other women. While I understand the need for security checks, the selection process felt arbitrary and poorly managed, as it seemed to disproportionately target women. This left a sour note just before boarding."

The flights massively exceeded our expectations.  Operationally all 4 sectors were on time and a wheelchair was waiting for me at every destination.  The special assistance teams were always most considerate at departures and arrivals.  From a customer service point of view the cabin crews were always most positive, the meals, drinks and entertainment systems put all other airlines to shame.  The chauffeur service for departures and arrivals made the whole trip an absolute joy.
So why have I not given a score of 10 for recommendation?
All the positives were negated by the terrible attitudes of the chat team when I asked why I had not been awarded the Skywards miles. Firstly, a number of the team quickly cut off the conversation when I was slower to respond than they liked (that's what a stroke does to your typing speeds). Then the problem was identified; I had dared to use the given name I have been using for +77 years to register on the Emirates App.  However, my parents gave me 3 given names and the one I use is the third one!  Of course all computer systems assume that the first given name, which I detest and have never used, is the most important one.  I was told that  I would have to change my name on the App.

When asked the support team they told that they missed the baggage in Melbourne. When the baggage was checked in Auckland, they charged me $200+ for 3 kg excess which was ok with me. The intrest they showed to collect money didnt reflect in their service to deliver the baggage. I was ok with that as things happen. The baggage team updated on that night in Dubai saying that they have the bag in Melbourne and will be sending on the flight that night so that I can collect next day from Dubai airport which was confirmed through official email. Next day when I went to collect, they were saying that the baggage was still in Melbourne and they accepted that they gave me wrong information. I was like what.!!! Are you kidding me..!!.These things are unexpectable when we expect something more from a big organisation like Emirates üá¶üá™. I was getting engaged two days after I landed in Banglore and everything that I need for the function which was packed and planned 6 months before travel date aand got ruined just because of their carelessness. I waited at home to get any update regarding the baggage and each time I call support team they were saying that they will update to baggage team and this kept on repeating like in a loop as any support staff that I call tells entirely different story. In Dubai the Emirates üá¶üá™ teams confirmed that they will be delivering the bag to my door step within a day or two but got a call few hours ago from Bangalore Emirates üá¶üá™ team asking me to come to airport to collect the baggage as they dont do deliveries and their comes the third """"WRONG INFORMATION""""..!! Imagine going home after 3 years to meet family empty handed even without cloths to change. I hope no one would come across this situation. Its so frustrating and ruins everything mentally, physically, emotionally. Everything for the function, now I have to buy them all again spending more that $6000 as their is no way I could change my specail wedding date which I was planning for months only because of the carelessness from Emirates üá¶üá™. Filed an online complaint in Dubai and its been 2 days and haven't received any response from the complaint.

At around 3:30am the flight attendants came around with the dietary requirement snack, they arrived at my seat and confirmed who I was and that I was having a gluten free meal and then handed me the snack item labelled my name and """"GFML‚Äù (see picture attached). 

I began to eat the snack and after getting halfway through the one sausage roll I turned over the box to see that it was not gluten free and actually it contained wheat and gluten (see attached). This was horrifying to me as I knew that eating this snack was going to make me extremely sick and I had a 24 hour flight ahead of me. 

We called the flight attendant to ask them about this and at first they looked at the box and immediately dismissed me and told me it was a gluten free meal, when we questioned how this was gluten free as the ingredients stated it contained wheat, he said he would get his supervisor. The supervisor then came over and said sorry it was a mixup and they had ran out of gluten free meals so a different flight attendant had just put the gluten free sticker on a normal snack and that they didn‚Äôt have anything else but he could maybe get me some fruit. 

The reasoning that I was given is appalling and extremely worrying that there is such a total lack of understanding that Emirates flight attendants would just put a sticker on any meal and pretend that they were serving me a gluten free meal. I explained that this was unacceptable as I had already now eaten the food and that I have coeliac disease and now I would be extremely ill to which I then heard back ‚Äúoh so what will you have an anaphylactic shock‚Äù. Clearly there is just no understanding.

I spent the remainder of that 7 hour flight with severe stomach pains, sickness and vomiting. The fact that dietary requirement options mean so little to the staff that they will just serve normal meals and put on a gluten free sticker when they run out is extremely worrying. 

I was too worried to eat anything that had a gluten free sticker with no ingredients on the box for the remainder of the flight as I simply did not trust the staff.

This year I was so excited to try business class for the first time having already done Etihad and Qatar business. I expected this would be my best business class experience and how wrong I was. The lounge in Bangkok was awful and food was cold. After eating there I was violently sick for 2 days. Once on the plane the seats were small and not comfortable to sleep in. The bar was nothing special compared to the one on Qatar and the toilets were right nearby so the bar was overrun with people queuing and not pleasant sitting close to a toilet whilst trying to enjoy a drink. No amenity kit on day flights where as Etihad and Qatar gave out them regardless. Mine and a family members entertainment system did not work the whole flight. The lounge in Dubai despite the hype was again nothing special. Not what you expect when you pay thousands of pounds for a flight and especially with the huge increase in prices nowadays you expect more.

I recently flew on Emirates flight EK648 from Dubai to Colombo, and I want to share my appreciation for the outstanding service provided by the cabin crew. While I usually travel business class‚Äîmost recently on my Colombo-London-Colombo journeys‚Äîthis time, I opted for economy class as it was a short flight and company-sponsored.

The flight from Colombo to Dubai was comfortable, but the return flight was truly special. I wasn‚Äôt feeling well and was utterly sick during the journey. The crew‚Äôs care and attentiveness, even in economy class, were exceptional.

As someone who travels frequently, I can confidently say that this level of customer care is rare. Emirates consistently exceeds expectations, and this experience reaffirmed why it remains my preferred airline.

It's absolutely unreasonable to ask someone to pack a laptop in their carry-on suitcase and then remove it every time you go through security.

To make matters worse, they insisted that I check in my carry-on and demanded a $225 fee, which is outrageous. If I had checked in an extra bag, it would have only cost $150.

Our seating was the immediate row behind the child/infant row. Needless to say , we had to adjust a lot because of this . 
Firstly , the family occupied 3 overhead lockers because of which we had to put our hand luggage 10 rows behind , which we didn‚Äôt make a fuss about .
Secondly , as soon as the family settled down they  rested their seats behind throughout the flight even at the time of takeoff and during the meal time as well . I believe the seats HAS TO BE UPRIGHT DURING TAKEOFF as it is one of the safety measures .But Zaina/Zainab failed to do her duty and compromised on the safety of others, which again we never uttered a word about .

Few hours passed and when it was food time , the seats remained the same way making it highly uncomfortable for us to even have our meal .We still tried to adjust but it was getting really difficult which is when we confronted  Zaina/Zainab and requested her to inform the previous travellers to put their seat upright for atleast 10 mins of meal time .

Her reply was very unprofessional showing poor customer service .On a high note, she replied ‚Äú I can‚Äôt ask them as they have babies ‚Äú. Well, we do understand they have a baby which is why we‚Äôve been adjusting all along ,but all we asked was just 10 mins of comfortable eating .
Is this too much to ask for considering the fact that we have also paid the same amount and chosen Emirates for a reason.

She didn‚Äôt stop torturing my family , when it was sunrise she ask me to shut the window pane while all the others windows were open and were clicking pics .I paid extra for the window seat to enjoy the sunrise view but it became a total disappointment again .

She never let us enjoy or relax on the flight .She kept pestering us but it was our decency that we remained quiet .

Later we came to know that this rational  behaviour of her was because she was from the same country as the previous travellers .

We‚Äôve been frequent flyers of emirates and we always choose emirates for their customer service and flight experience.

Comment	I‚Äôm a business developer, I have masters degree in engineering, a masters degree in human behavior, psychology, and a diploma and literature. I was traveling to Cairo on a business trip and on my way back from Dubai to LA. I had an accident inside the airplane I sat on A broken seat which I didn‚Äôt notice, and when I was standing up to go to the bathroom, the cushion under me slid down, and I slid under the front seat in front of me, I hit my head, my hip and my knees with the front seat and the floor, the flight attendants came, helped me to stand up and placed me on a different seat which eventually was also broken (Pictures attached) and I‚Äôd love the move me to the back of the airplane gave me some painkillers and I was in pain for the 16 hours which was the duration of the trip to LA. I requested an upgrade and I requested to pay for it not for free to be more comfortable and less pain but the crew refused. I was hospitalized yesterday and still in a lot of pain.

I'm quite disappointed with the service at the airport. I was there last night to assist my sister, who was traveling alone with a 1-year-old child. Traveling with a child is challenging, and although we booked the flight last minute and understood that the Marhaba service was fully booked, I found the staff less approachable and helpful than expected.

We requested a stroller but were informed that it was only available after immigration‚Äîa policy implemented during COVID. While I understand this policy, I believe it would be beneficial to have a few strollers available before immigration, especially for those who need extra assistance.

What disappointed me most was the lack of a priority lane at the check-in counters for elderly passengers, pregnant women, and those with infants. It wouldn‚Äôt be difficult to allocate at least one lane for these travelers in such a large airport. When I approached an Emirates staff member to inquire about a priority lane, I was informed there wasn‚Äôt one. I suggested that Emirates consider implementing this, as it‚Äôs essential. His response surprised me: ‚ÄúYou should talk to Emirates!.‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you work for Emirates? Aren‚Äôt you the face of the airline?‚Äù Only then, after seeing my disappointment, did he open a lane for us and prioritize our check-in. I want to clarify that I don't intend to get any staff member in trouble, as he did assist us with check-in and arranged a buggy and wheelchair once he saw my disappointment and after I mentioned I would be sharing this request and complaint  with Emirates.

As a well-known airline recognized as one of the best, I believe Emirates would benefit from further training for staff on customer service.

Well that depends on how you value comfort, quality, and standards. The business class lounges are very good, the check in, is a breeze, there is no queuing, you are fast tracked through, as with passport control, you get chauffeured from home to your destination airport and from airport to hotel. The service on board is very good and quality of food and drinks is much better than you get in economy. The staff are very attentive and make you feel special.

My reluctance to flight out from Stansted has always been that until recently Emirates had an area within the busy contract lounge at Stansted which was okay but not like LGWE or LHR.
Six weeks ago Emirates opened their own lounge at Stansted and its a game changer 
I was escorted to check in by my chauffeur and experienced the usual efficient check in and very rapid fast track security.
The gate agent was kind enough to tell me any duty free shopping had to be done before going on the shuttle to the lounge which is adjacent to the gate (as there is no way back!)
The new lounge is at gate 12 so after a shuttle ride entered the Emirates lounge, very familiar theme and just like other Emirates lounges anywhere. Staff were very friendly and clearly proud of the new lounge - as they should be, as it was spacious and well supplied with food and beverages.
The biggest advantage is that you board from the lounge just like at Dubai or LHR
So for me the addition of the Emirates lounge and the ability to board from the gate has increased the attractiveness of Stansted as my departure point from London
As for the rest of the flight, this (evening) flight wasn't the game changer first, but the friendly crew and usual fabulous service made for a great experience as usual"

Our flight, EK720, was scheduled to depart at 16:35 to Dubai, with a forward connection to London.

Upon our arrival at the airport at 13:45, we expected a smooth process, especially given the delay, however, we faced significant issues at the check-in counter.

I hold an Indian passport but possess a right to work and indefinite leave to remain in the UK. I provided a digitised copy of my immigration status from GOV.UK and an email confirming my resident card was being renewed and was to be delivered shortly.

Despite presenting these documents, the Emirates representative requested that we wait patiently and kept my documents, including my passport and settlement status letter. The representative indicated a concern with my expired resident card and advised that they needed time to verify my documents. We were left standing for 2 hours with no updates or information about our situation. Despite multiple inquiries, we received vague responses and no substantive progress.

It was evident that the staff were ignorant about the required documentation and displayed a dismissive attitude towards resolving the issue. Despite my repeated suggestions to contact higher management in Dubai or Heathrow, I was informed that no one was available or responsive. This lack of proactive problem-solving skills was disappointing and unprofessional, especially given Emirates' reputation for customer care.

After two hours of anxiety and distress, we were eventually allowed to proceed to the gate. However, before allowing us to board, the staff informed us that they were """"taking a big risk"""" by sending us to Dubai and that I was to meet the transfer desk staff upon arrival immediately. They stated that it would be up to the Dubai ground handling staff to decide whether I would proceed to London or be deported to India, which they implied was likely. Such remarks were appalling and unjust, reflecting a severe lack of empathy and understanding.

During this time, my sugar levels dropped and my husband being a heart patient was overly stressed. This ordeal caused considerable discomfort, inconvenience, and emotional and mental stress as it was handled poorly, reflecting a significant lapse in professional standards and customer care.

The situation overshadowed what had otherwise been a delightful first visit to Kenya to celebrate our 25th Wedding Anniversary. The lack of urgency, knowledge, and professionalism in handling the issue was unacceptable.

I request a thorough investigation into this matter and appropriate compensation for the inconvenience and distress caused.  I trust Emirates to address this issue with the seriousness it warrants to prevent such experiences for other passengers in the future.

I look forward to a prompt and satisfactory resolution."

In all, 3 screens- and I'm pretty two acted for anything and the other was a remote. Of course, there was another remote that isn't a screen. Since it was on the A380, we also had a bar we can go to. There were some cakes and snacks there, it was great. The menu was also great, I really liked the mint tea- I think that was it. When the flight started, we each got a drink/juice in a nice cup. The entertainment menu was the biggest I've ever seen, and at the end of the flight, we got chocolates- and they tasted great, super fine. The cabin attendants were also super helpful.

A few minutes after boarding, captain announced the delay to fix some mechanical issues. It took exactly 3 hours. It was not emergency issue. It was routine maintenance problem that was found out minutes before the departure. Routine maintenance failure! About one hour before landing , I asked about my connecting flight which was worrisome  not to make it. She stated that I was gonna find out on the ground ! She stated she had no information. This was not acceptable. Ground crews can always connect with aircrews.?On the ground, she stated that my option is to fly tomorrow since there is only one flight daily to Rio. That was also not acceptable since my little sister was gonna  meet us today not tomorrow. We have full day tour in Rio the next day. Ground crew offered  a flight through Lisbon 22hours (original flight time 14hours) to get to Rio but I have to ride economy since business class was fully booked. She also stated my original ticket was economy. I objected that and showed her my ticket from bkk to Rio, all in business class.

From google flight, the alternative is through Frankfurt (21hours15min) arrival exactly same 5.25am as through Lisbon. The business class was also available.

As my husband and I were being taken by buggy to our connecting flight, another Emirates crew member stopped the buggy, spoke to the driver, and then without any permission, she sat beside my husband. This felt like a clear invasion of privacy, and what made it worse was her behavior when she realized I was his wife. She got down immediately and moved to the front. It was inappropriate and extremely uncomfortable, making me wonder how Emirates trains its staff when it comes to respecting passenger boundaries.
I‚Äôve always expected a high level of service and professionalism from Emirates, especially in First Class, but this experience left a bad impression. Privacy and personal space are essential, especially when traveling in a premium cabin, and this incident showed a complete disregard for both.

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my disappointment regarding an unpleasant experience I had during my recent flight with Emirates, which was surprising given my history as a loyal Gold member.

During the flight, I witnessed a crew member displaying unprofessional behavior towards a fellow passenger. The passenger, who did not speak English, struggled to understand the crew member's instructions. Instead of offering assistance, the crew member raised her voice and insisted, """"ONLY ENGLISH,"""" which I found both shocking and disrespectful. This kind of treatment, especially towards someone who was clearly struggling, does not align with the high standards of service I have come to expect from Emirates.

Additionally, after our transit in Rio, I requested a blanket. The crew member retrieved a used blanket from the overhead storage and handed it to me. When I explained that I had not used a blanket during the flight and requested a new one, she insisted that the used blanket was mine. Her dismissive attitude in this situation was equally disappointing.

Throughout the flight, the crew member's demeanor was generally unpleasant. She rarely smiled and gave orders in an unfriendly manner, whether it was during boarding or when serving food. This lack of warmth and approachability contributed to an overall negative experience.

I understand that every airline can have off days, but the level of service I experienced was far below what I have come to appreciate from Emirates. I hope you will address this matter to ensure that future passengers receive the respectful and courteous service that Emirates is known for.

Thank you for your attention to this issue.

Sincerely,"

I am not a frequent flier and also I would usually go for a flight which has the cheapest fare. When I booked my flight emirates was the flight which was having the lowest fare, so I went for it.
My experience with Emirates was not good even before, but now....Yes the time when I asked for some water was very bad that is exactly 34 minutes before landing, just bcoz they sealed everything they didn't give me water. I was travelling alone with an infant and I had called for assistance, as my previous experience with emirates was bad I knew that they are not going to assist, but since I was really in need I had to call them again, and atlast they came, the light over my seat was not turning off and they were not ready to fix it, if needed I can shift my seat; as feeding was comfortable in corner seat I preferred that and they want me to be in the Middle seat.
My humble suggestion for emirates is that you all can have a study tour with either Etihad airways or Singapore airlines as the service they provide is really really amazing and yes they deserve the best airline tag. Their service will make us fly with them again and they are the best airlines which I have ever travelled with."

What I experienced, having Emirates used in the past, a previously highly rated airline did certainly not meet the expectations at all, and I will not to use them ever again in the future. 
 
1.) The seat booked had a jammed back rest which I reported and received an offer for a different seat, one at a window with other passengers sitting in that row and a second one in front of a bulkhead, next to the aisle.  
 
2.) It felt that the whole crew were fairly new in the job as they felt a bit lost serving clients. They regularly bumped into my legs while coming out behind the curtains. 
 
3.) Not too long into the flight all the toilets on the left (backbord) stopped operating and therefore were locked as not being operational anymore. With a flight which was fully booked in Economy this caused quite some inconvenience. 
 
4.) The food served was honestly absolutely appalling. 
 
5.) When I boarded the next flight from Dubai to Auckland, me and other passenger noticed water drops and some small particles coming out of ceilings ventilation grid for quite some time before it finally stopped. One of the other passengers complaint about it but was just told not to worry. 
 
6.) The landing in Frankfurt was extremely harsh and quite frightening to say at least. Maybe a young pilot was given the opportunity to land the fully loaded plane. You might want to consider training your pilots in a safe environment, especially when having passengers on board. I can tell you that everyone I talked to was very extremely frightened. 

I formerly complained an d they responded 'Regrettably, our response time is currently longer than usual. We will endeavour to provide you with a personalised response within 60 days.'

I was welcomed and escorted to my seat 2A which was pretty much identical to the seats on the 777 but this seat had some issues and had seen better days like trim falling off the underside of the shelf under the TV and the little vanity mirror wouldn‚Äôt close due to the trim around it being damaged which was a little disappointing given the prices they charge either in $ or miles.

I pointed this out to one of the cabin crew and they apologised and said I could move to the seat behind me which was free as were a total of 10 seats in the 14 seat first class cabin.

Once settled into my new seat the service began with a glass of the 2013 Dom Perignon champagne, Arabic coffee and dates.

Once in the air I didn‚Äôt bother with the full meal service and had the beef sliders from the movie snack menu which were delicious.

The service throughout the flight was fantastic and with only 4 passengers in total the staff gave everyone a lot of attention. At one stage I went back to the bar and was escorted by a crew member who let me know if I wanted anything from the first class menu to let them know.

The big difference between the 777 and A380 apart from the bar is the shower room which is a novel experience having a shower at 35,000 feet. One of the benefits of flying first class is all the goodies you end up with at the end of the flight including pyjamas, lovely slippers, Bulgari amenity kit which is well stocked, Breydo and Voya amenities, chocolates and the contents of the snack basket all in a lovely tote bag.

Pros -
1) The legroom for economy is sufficiently spacious for a 1.6m.
2) Headphones provided, instead of earplugs.
3) Some seats have 3 pin plug for faster charging.

Cons - 
1) The air stewardesses/stewards will go around with big bagd to collect the blankets and headphones one hour before landing, leaving you cold and soundless for one hour. 
2) For flight from Singapore to Dubai (EK405), we used the call bell as we wanted to request for snacks. 15 mins and a total of 3 calls, nobody attended to us. An air steward happened to walk past so we managed to get some help. Conclusion, call bell is useless.
3) For flight from Dubai to Geneva (EK089), I brought an empty cup to the galley as i need it to be thrown away and the toilets were all taken. There were around 6 air stewardesses/stewards sitting and standing around. some of them didn't look at me (hopefully they just didn't notice me and not ignoring me), some of them looked at me and just, look, even after i stretch out my hand to show my empty cup and asked if i get it thrown. awkwardly stood around a minute or two, with my hand stretched, until an air steward from the other side of the galley squeeze past this group of air stewardesses and took the empty cup off me.

Unfortunately, our flight from Singapore was delayed due to a technical issue, causing us to miss our connecting flight to France in Dubai (flight EK075). When we arrived in Dubai, we received a new boarding pass for the next day‚Äôs flight, along with a voucher for accommodation and meals. However, we were not informed about other options, and the staff at the Dubai Connect counter were unhelpful. They directed us to leave the airport, take a shuttle bus, and contact Emirates customer service for more assistance.

We were unaware of our rights to request other forms of compensation or assistance without accepting the voucher. While we appreciated the accommodation and dinner, we faced significant inconvenience. Without our checked luggage, we had to spend the night in the same clothes and without essential toiletries. We also had to wake up at 12:30 AM and check out by 1:00 AM to catch the shuttle back to the airport, which added to our discomfort and exhaustion. As a result, we missed half a day of planned activities in Paris. 

We were shown as eligible for the Dubai Connect service, which includes complimentary accommodation, transport, and meals, until three days before our flight back from Rome to Melbourne. However, when we tried to book it from Italy we couldn‚Äôt complete the process. Our friends, who traveled with us and booked the same flight together (6mins later) , were able to access the service without any issues.

My husband spent hours on the phone with Emirates customer service trying to find out why we couldn‚Äôt use the Dubai Connect service, and we were very disappointed with their professionalism. 

We visited the Dubai Connect counter again on September 22, 2024. This time the officers were cooperative, but they could only offer us a discounted room at the same hotel where our friends were staying, which we declined. I highly recommend booking the Dubai Connect service in advance, rather than waiting for the """"at least 24 hours"""" mentioned on the website.

We were patiently waiting with hunger and tiredness to enter the airport with valid travel documents due to unprofessional security guards.

When we approached to the check in window, we were  subjected to  treat harassment and bullying by a member of Emirates‚Äô ground staff stating that the back bag is not allowed per the airline rules. This is ridiculous and the female Emirates staff was so mean to us.I saw travelers carrying laptop bags in addition to the hand luggage.

She sold me their Flex Plus product which offers free changes to dates. then advised that since I have the points i should get my self a free upgrade.  For this I was told I needed to go to their Skywards team - She transferred the call without taking payment - which i thought was odd - SHE DID NOT DISCLOSE that the ticket price could change as a result of the transfer - Skywards guy takes his time to find the flights again and check these flights for available upgrades. He took 15 minutes to do this - by which time the ticket prices had changed by $750. The ticket price he was offering was $100 more expensive than what was available online -  He explained to me the reasons behind these and i was still willing to pay the amount to book my urgent trip - He advised me to book the ticket online and then save the $100 and then he did the 1 upgrade he found (from 4 flights) and asked for a further $250 for tax. I get we have to pay tax and i get that he had no choice in the matter - I was extremely disappointed in the lack of care they had over the phone to not disclose to me these  2 things - 1. Ticket price could change as a result of transferring to another team. 2 - There will be a Tax to pay on any upgrades, even though you have bought a Flex Plus ticket and its advertised as free upgrades. Their lack of care has cost me $750 (I decided not to take the """"free"""" upgrade and increase my loss to $1,000. When complained to his manager - The manager showed such a poor level of empathy and class i was shocked that she was a manager in a so called prestigious air line.

Emirates don‚Äôt have their own lounge in Kuala Lumpur and direct you to the Global Lounge which is a nice lounge for a third party lounge.

The real experience starts when you board and you are escorted to your seat and served a glass of 2013 Dom Perignon which is a nice touch since some airlines don‚Äôt serve their best champagne on the ground or any champagne at all due to taxes. 
Waiting at your seat is an impressive Bulgari amenity kit, a snack basket stocked with some gourmet treats which the cabin staff remove for take-off and landing and the motorized mini bar. Also in the suite is a note pad and pen both with the Emirates logo and a second tray with Breydo amenities and shortly after sitting down they bring you slippers and pyjamas and a nice tote bag to put everything in to take with you at the end of the flight which came in very handy.

After take-off the service begins with a drink and small plate of potato chips and then the meal service starts which given my 7.40pm departure from Kuala Lumpur was perfectly timed for dinner, though in Emirates first class you can dine at any time during the flight.

The meal started with their famous caviar service which I thoroughly enjoyed followed by tomato soup and then a lovely beef tenderloin and rounded out by a nice cheese plate and chocolates and more champagne.

Rounding out the experience was a glass of the very expensive Hennessy Paradis cognac which unfortunately wasn‚Äôt to my taste but a final glass of champagne made up for that.

Meanwhile they asked us to shuffle some weight from one bag to another. Immediately I shared that we shall release the payment of the upgrade immediately. Ms Anjali Maheshwari & Mr Ashwin Rajput shared that our seats in business class is confirmed and reserved and once the weight is shuffled from one bag to another, they shall issue business class tickets. 

We approached in sometime after delivering the  luggage at the counter. Now, they handed over to me the payment voucher for making payment. 

After approaching the counter Mr Yatin Patel shared that the tickets are not available. 

Moreover, they lacked courtesy.  When inquired about Mr Ashwin Rajput, we were not made to speak to him. 

They knowingly tore the payment voucher they had handed over to me for making payment.

Mr Yatin Patel & Ms Maheshwari were not interested in answering to my queries. Rather they kept on irritating us by offering three seats of front row at some additional cost.  And they did this for almost 7-8 times. May be, emirates airlines seems to be giving them more commission on seats rather then ensuring customer satisfaction.

We prefer Emirates airlines over other airlines for the brand name it possesses and not for the value system which we believe must be in place. 

Had I invested in emirates airlines, I would surely have sold my shares today looking to the quality of experience I had. 

The team lacked basic courtesy, politeness & ability to understand their customer. 

For me it‚Äôs important because I was desirous of gifting the business class seat to my daughter who is going to london for her further education. This seat had an emotional value which got tarnished. 

I am sure Emirates team shall work upon this and keep the brand name it possesses, which seems unlikely looking to the non promising  qualities of their team. 

May you improve and upgrade systems first and then seats so that customer meets their expectations of experience from emirates.

While the flight itself and the food were excellent, my overall experience was significantly diminished by the conduct of the cabin staffs. The male flight attendant serving my section displayed a consistently cold and unfriendly attitude, which, though unpleasant, I could tolerate. However, his actions during the flight were unprofessional and rude.

On multiple occasions, he kicked my feet without offering any apology, which was already unsettling. What was most concerning, though, was how he handled the mattress storage. For some reason, they had stored a mattress in the overhead bin right above my seat. Throughout the flight, he would repeatedly access the bin, even while I was seated, leaving it open for extended periods. At one point, he spent approximately five minutes retrieving the mattress and installing it on various seats around the plane, all while keeping the bin open. 

This not only prevented me from accessing the bathroom, but also made me feel like I was sitting in a storage closet, as though my comfort and experience were secondary to their operational needs. The level of unprofessionalism and disregard for passenger comfort was truly disappointing.

This year, I recommended she try Emirates due to their new direct flight from Dubai to Montreal, thinking it would be a convenient and positive change. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a big mistake.

The service was shockingly poor from the start. Her flight was at 10:20 am, and she was only served lunch‚Äîno breakfast or snacks beforehand, which was both surprising and disappointing. Comparing her experience to Qatar Airways, it was obvious she was right‚ÄîEmirates‚Äô service was unacceptable.

For the entire 12-hour flight, the staff reacted rudely every time she asked for assistance, making her feel uncomfortable and unwelcome.

The situation worsened on her connecting flight from Dubai to Iran. She described the aircraft as small and cramped, with uncomfortable seats, even for someone as fit as her. The tight, compact seating only added to her discomfort, making the flight unbearable. To make matters worse, when she finally arrived in Tehran, one of her suitcases was missing, containing valuable gifts and personal items‚Äîa situation that had never happened to her before.

In the end, my mom vowed never to fly with Emirates again and would not recommend them to anyone. Based on her experience, I too will avoid recommending Emirates.

I recently had a disappointing experience with Emirates Airways. Due to medical issues, I had to cancel my flight. Despite informing them, I was still charged a $400 no-show fee and an additional $1000 to rebook the next flight.
When I suggested purchasing my own one-way ticket and using my original return flight, they refused, stating that I must take the first flight to access the return flight. This policy felt inflexible and added unnecessary stress to an already difficult situation.
Additionally, I was initially booked on a flight with a three-hour delay in Dubai, which was manageable. However, they did not allow me to board that flight and only offered an option with an 11-hour layover in Dubai. This added further inconvenience to my travel plans."

My recent round-trip from Dubai to Spain with a stopover in Madrid was a masterclass in how to turn a premium airline experience into a frustrating obstacle course, all while wrangling a child under 10.

The fun began on our way to Madrid, where Emirates kindly provided only one boarding pass‚Äîno sign of the second leg. Upon arrival in Madrid, we found ourselves unable to access the terminal for our connecting flight. Instead, we were treated to a leisurely sprint across four terminals, dragging luggage and a bewildered child, just to find the Iberia counter and get our boarding passes. And that was the easy part.

The return journey? Even better. Same missing boarding pass fiasco, only this time, our luggage was checked through to Dubai while we were left to figure out how to make it there ourselves. Denied lounge access, stuck navigating terminal changes, and chatting with Emirates customer service, who seemed more convinced that I had missed my own flight than helping me board it. Yes, you read that right‚Äîapparently, my luggage was having a better trip than I was.

Emirates, for the prices you charge, a little customer service goes a long way. Maybe a counter with an actual human being in Terminal 4S to help passengers would be nice, especially since you chose to partner with Iberia, not me. After this fiasco, I‚Äôm seriously considering switching airlines. Swiss Air might not have your glitz, but at least they spare me the headache."

Unfortunately, my recent experience on flight EK564 from Dubai to Bengaluru recently, has left me deeply disappointed and frustrated. I am sharing this experience in the hope that it brings awareness to the issues I faced and prompts Emirates to reevaluate how they handle customer complaints.

The Incident at the Boarding Gate

On the day of my flight, I arrived at the boarding gate well before the closure time‚Äîalmost 10 minutes prior. Despite this, I was subjected to harassment and bullying by a member of Emirates‚Äô ground staff. After my boarding pass was processed, the situation escalated unnecessarily, leading to verbal abuse and even the involvement of airport security with a false allegation that I had pushed the staff member. This baseless accusation was quickly dismissed when the security personnel realized that the area was under CCTV surveillance and agreed to review the footage.
What I found most troubling was the abuse of power displayed by the staff. Instead of simply processing my boarding pass and allowing me to board, the situation was unnecessarily escalated, causing significant distress. It was a situation that could have been easily avoided with basic professionalism and courtesy.

The Unapologetic Response from Emirates Customer Affairs

Following the incident, I reached out to Emirates Customer Affairs, expecting them to take my complaint seriously and address the unacceptable behavior of their staff. However, the response I received was nothing short of dismissive.

In their email, they reiterated that """"all Emirates staff are trained to interact with passengers in a professional and courteous manner,"""" and proceeded to remind me of the airline‚Äôs policy regarding boarding times. This response completely ignored the core of my complaint‚Äîthe unprofessional and abusive behavior I encountered at the gate.

What was even more frustrating was the lack of any apology or acknowledgment of the distress I experienced. Instead, the response seemed to shift the blame back onto me, implying that I had failed to adhere to boarding procedures, which was not the case. It was a classic example of a company failing to take responsibility for the actions of its staff and choosing to hide behind policies rather than addressing the real issue.

My Follow-Up to Emirates

In my follow-up email to Emirates, I made it clear that I arrived at the gate on time and that my boarding pass was processed well before the gate closure. I also highlighted the fact that the false allegation made by the staff member was quickly disproven by the security personnel. I urged Emirates to reconsider how they handle such complaints and to take necessary steps to improve their staff training programs.

I emphasized that my past experiences with Emirates had been positive, but this incident was deeply unsettling. I also pointed out that the entire situation could have been avoided if the staff had simply processed my boarding pass without resorting to threats and false accusations.

Conclusion

My experience with Emirates on this occasion was far from the high standard I had come to expect from the airline. The behavior of their ground staff was unprofessional and abusive, and the response from their Customer Affairs department was unapologetic and dismissive.

I am sharing this experience in the hope that it serves as a wake-up call for Emirates to take complaints from their passengers seriously and to ensure that their staff are truly trained to treat customers with the respect and courtesy they deserve. If this is the way Emirates handles genuine complaints, it raises serious questions about their commitment to customer service."

The flight connected at Dubai airport with assistance to the lounge there (which was very busy) and then on to our connecting flight. The cost was definitely worth it, to start our holiday feeling rested and relaxed. The business class service on the flight was equivalent to what I had earlier experienced on a first-class Virgin Atlantic flight from New York to Heathrow. Staff were helpful.

If their experience was better, I would travel with Emirates next time. But I feel that their good service is only for big celebrities or business class passengers. I had the worst experience of my life with Emirates. The air hostess was so unfriendly to me and to the lady sitting next to me, who also had a baby. We asked for a blanket three times, and her answer was always, 'Wait, I‚Äôll give it to you in a little while, I‚Äôm busy right now.' When she was offering soda drinks with meals to everyone, I told her I didn‚Äôt want a soda drink, just an extra glass of water. She said, 'Finish your own water first, and then I‚Äôll give you more.' I explained that I‚Äôm a kidney patient and I can‚Äôt have soda; I just need an extra glass of water. She said, 'Let me give water to the other passengers first, and if there‚Äôs any left, I‚Äôll give it to you' (so in such a big airline, she didn‚Äôt have extra water). I had booked a no-sodium meal, and when it arrived, it had fish in it (of course, this is not the airline's fault). I told her that I can‚Äôt eat fish, and asked if she could give me any other meal. I even said, 'Give me anything else, I just can‚Äôt eat fish.' She said, 'We can‚Äôt provide any extra meals; you‚Äôll have to eat this.' On Qatar Airways, if I don‚Äôt like my meal and want to change it, they change it for me because they have extras. I never expected that such a big airline could treat a regular passenger so poorly.

She just had this bad attitude and ordered me to move our stuff around and left us!

The purpose of my travel was to accompany a team of 8 sports stars of India who had bagged gold medals for India over the past years.  They were commencing the first leg of their journey towards Paris to attend events at the ongoing Olympics all dressed in impressive T-Shirts displaying logos of the 2024 Olympics as well the Indian Flag and a PIN.  Three of them were my colleagues when I worked in the Southern Railways in Chennai in the 1980s (Baskaran,  Gnanasekaran and Vairavan), two of them from the Chennai Customs (Prabhakar and Natarajan), one from ICF (Balakumar), one from TATA Steel in Bangalore (Charles), one from ICF (Balakumar),  and one from Tamilnadu Electricity Board (Chinnasamy).   We met at the Chennai International Airport and were assisted by Emirates ground staff of the airport in the most courteous manner.  I was the only woman travelling with them on this first leg of the journey from MAA to Dubai.  

I approached the flight in charge Mr. Jad Chidiac and apprised him of the team who were passengers on the said EK 545 Emirates flight and Jad exceeded ALL our expectations and went out of his way to assist the Indian sports stars.  His colleagues, Ms. AWA and Ms. Maria Campuzana too went that extra mile despite managing a FULL FLIGHT to make our journey comfortable.  In fact, I had travelled on EK 544 DXB to MAA  on 31 July and AWA recognised that I was on the flight the previous day.  I too recognised that AWA served the passengers in a very courteous way as a flight attendant on the 31 July flight as well.

The food was better , but i didn't get the photos, which were pretty nice. Same thing with the crew. The airport was not the best but better than 95% of airport i been. It was crowded and Lively. The security was fast. The downside was that since the airport was a dome shaped i couldn't see the planes. Plus the thing i found weird was that before boarding the flight to dfw there was a mini security check. I didn't know why they did it even though after people deplane the plane  they go to the security check.(I don't blame emirates it is more of a airport safety thing). When i went to the gate i was disappointed since it was a b 777 not a a 380. Once i boarded the seat was great, same with the leg room. Once the plane was boarded the safety came and we pushed back. The Safety video started in Arabic then English. Which is very important since it was a Boeing and people can know. I saw the old one and the new one(old on dfw to hyd) (New hyd to dfw) old one was better. Then the ice video came which i found a bit Unnecessary. When we wee about to take off the thing i did not make Sense what that the planes were using the right runway even thought left runway was empty.

I believe its time to expose this airline for their complete disregard and poor customer service and possibly in the field of stealing. Since I arrived from Dubai on the 23rd of May 2023 (14 months anniversary approaching), I have been in correspondence with Emirates regarding the mysterious damages of my carry on suitcase which was later stolen by your baggage handling company representing Emirates Airlines. Against my will, my carry-on was removed from my possession while I was boarding the plane at Italy (transit location), which I questioned immensely, since my carry-on was approved at the initial departure location (Dubai). Why was I singled out, and commanded to give my carry-on to the attendant? Against my better judgment, I obliged and was assured my suitcase will be kept safe. In result, upon arrival awaiting my luggage in the baggage claim, I was astonished, and found my well conditioned carry-on was mishandled causing a great tear in the middle (front of bag). Immediately, I made a complaint at the airport, received a reference number via text message (JFKD999302). Through tedious e-mails and phone calls it was agreed for the suitcase to be repaired, but in result the suitcase was held captive/stolen and no compensation was provided. I've call countless of times within this 2024 and have been assured to receive feedback within 48 hours. However, I'm consistently patronized and/or deceived. Emirates Airlines is a well established organization; declared the best airline in the world in 2018-2020. Emirates, being a worldwide known entity, one of the best airlines in the world, treated their passenger/client (or is it because I traveled economy class?) with poor communication and unsubstantial financial solution, is beyond my belief. Offering """"$50 USD"""" for the damages endured and time wasted is beyond offense. I'm entitled to Interim Relief compensation, since my baggage was damaged under the airline's control and transportation. In this regard, due to Emirates neglect, complete disregard for customer service, I am entitled to my suitcase and reparations for the damage and emotional strain this airline has caused. Again, it is such a disgrace and appalling a worldly know airline to have commit such an atrocity. After your luggage carrier retrieved my suitcase on the 26th of July, it took two months to receive this information from your team and this feedback was only provided due to my e-mail inquiry, which I find very unprofessional."

After checking in and clearing security and immigration you can make your way to the Qantas First Lounge to enjoy breakfast and then move to the Emirates Business Class Lounge that is closer to the boarding gate for some other refreshments before boarding announcement is made.

The flight was about 30mins delayed due to the late arrival of the aircraft from Dubai.

Boarding for First and Business class passengers is via separate aero bridge through the upper deck of the A380. If you wish to walk up the stairs from the lower deck you can do this after boarding, prior to departing. 

The crew greet you with a warm welcome before being escorted to your first class suite. They will introduce themselves and they also ask if you are familiar with the aircraft and suite and provide you with information on how everything works in the suite and what is available on the flight today.

Beverages are offered and I chose champagne fully aware it will not be the Dom Perignon to start with, but an equally enjoyable champagne. This is due to taxes the airline would have to pay. The Dom Perignon flows freely after the aircraft levels out at cruising altitude. I am also offered the famous Arabic coffee and a selection of dates. A hot face washer is also offered along with a top up of champagne and the aircraft hasn‚Äôt even left the stand.

They enquire if you would like to use the shower suite available only on the A380 to first class passengers and book you in for 30 mins of which you will have 5 mins of water that can be turned on and off during the 5 mins.

As this is a short day flight amenity kits and pyjamas are available on request and were duly provided in the emirates bag.

The first class suite has water and soft drinks (not chilled) in the little minibar and a basket of sweets and chips.  There are a few more toiletries and a diary and pen in the console area below the large TV screen. A separate detachable control is available for use after reaching cruising altitude to control the TV and lighting in the suite along with the seat that converts into a lie flat bed. Controls separate to the device are located through the suite and in the armrest of the seat.

Pillows and bedding are also in the suite should you wish to sleep, although on this short flight I availed of the service and amenities rather than sleeping.

After levelling out I walked through business class to have a look at the onboard bar and seating area. Being a short flight they were still setting up the bar and shortly after I was served an Expresso martini. Food was also offered but as I would be having breakfast in flight and had eaten earlier in the lounges I declined.

Heading back to my suite I then ordered some caviar that came with accompaniments.  A second serve of caviar was also provided when requested and my breakfast order taken.

Breakfast included water, orange juice   fresh fruits , omlette and sausage with tomato and greens. Pastries were also presented to choose from.

The service was 6 stars from the check-in counter, lounges and onboard from the first class attendants, onboard bar attendants and the shower spa attendant who some passengers may not even acknowledge the work they do to present the shower spa in a clean condition after previous passengers use.

This was my third first class flight with Emirates but my first on a refurbished A380 with the updated interior that  now features softer cream colours and no longer the darker wood grain but still the nice gold trim.

The flight was made just that little more special by Karolina , Bianca and Adrianna the three first class  sttendants who provided exceptional service along with the onboard crew managing the bar and the chief steward.

Our eturn ride back to the hotel was not in their sytem - we ended up paying for a taxi. The armrest on my business class seat (B777-300 plane) was broken.

However, the evening meal was superb, the entertainment was faultless (lots of new films) and the staff were friendly.

My 3/5 rating stems from the queues and waiting times at Manchester airport - they were disorganised, manic and stressful. This accounts for boarding the aircraft and likewise for checking-in. The poorest i‚Äôve experienced in a long time but saved by the quality of the flight."

Now it is July 22nd and nobody is contacting us nor they r compensating even we opened a claim with them. I lost so much valuable stuff n there is no compensation till now. So avoid Emirates as they do not have any customer care. They just want our money but when it is their time to compensate, they are not doing it.

My carefully planned return trip from the UK with Emirates turned into a nightmare due to issues caused by your Dubai ground staff. Below are the details of my experience during Flight EK 354 from Dubai to Singapore on 7th July 2024.

Upon checking in at Manchester, I was issued a boarding pass for both the MAN-DXB and DXB-SIN legs of my journey, with seats allocated according to my pre-booking. However, upon reaching Dubai and during check-in, the counter staff took my boarding pass and issued a new one. Initially, I assumed the new boarding pass was due to a soiled document and did not notice the seat change, as there was no change in the flight. To my disappointment, the new seat I was assigned was directly in front of the toilet onboard.

I sought assistance from cabin crew and online chat services before take-off, but unfortunately, no one helped me. I had specifically opted for an Economy Flex Plus ticket to secure a seat reservation that would allow for a more comfortable journey. The proximity to the restroom doors, with their associated noise, significantly hindered my ability to rest or enjoy the flight services as intended. Furthermore, crew members frequently accessed the overhead luggage bins above my seat, further disrupting any chance of relaxation. During the meal service, crew members did not lock the lavatory door, causing passengers to enter and exit while I was eating, forcing me to stop my meal.

At the end of the journey, esteemed crew sarcastically asked about my flight experience, despite being well aware of the difficulties I had faced. Emirates' service in 2024 should be considered among the worst. Until today, I have not received any reply to my complaint, and customer service reminded me that it requires 60 days to send a reply. Compared to the past, Emirates' service quality has highly deteriorated, and it seems there no one cares about it."

I have flown Emirates a number of times, both Business and Economy between 2007 and 2014; and truthfully looked forward to flying with them again after a 10 year hiatus.
My neighbours, cousins and even sister (who travelled with me again this time), waxed lyrical about the 'Emirates experience' - and I can say without reservation, for us all, this 4 sector return flight through Dubai left us amazed; at how standards have fallen...
Notwithstanding the amazing customer service at BHX (NOT BHD) before we joined a 3 hour queue through security (yes seriously), the flight experience did nothing to alleviate our aggravation and in fact made it worse. 
Flying Birmingham (BHX)-Dubai (DXB) -Mauritius (MRU) (NOT Sri Lanka) - it was NOT a short ordeal by any means.
First of all lets talk about the seats: 
Never in my life have I ever had 'numb-bum' on an aircraft before. At 5 ft 7 and 77kg I am by a small to average guy who rarely has much complaint in economy; but yes - after 45 minutes, I could no longer feel my bottom. The seats on my military flights were more comfortable.
How much has Emirates seriously saved in weight by removing an inch of foam or reducing the quality of foam on the seat pads? Not much I would guess...
Now on to 'in flight 'service' or lack thereof:
We were informed there were 13 stewards in the economy section; that's about 7 more than a comparable Virgin or BA Flight; and we're pretty sure those 7 were invisible. 
Those that weren't invisible, could neither see or hear the passengers - as I found out after 90 minutes trying to get any one's attention for just a cup of water... 
""""we'll do a drinks service with dinner which is just heating up"""" I was informed; having stood without water at BHX for 180 minutes in the security queue - about which the Emirates check-in staff warned us; followed by another 90 minutes confined to my seat with the most ignorant cabin-services staff I had seen in 24 years... I was unsurprisingly thirsty...
Why 'confined to my seat'? 
Well on each sector of the journey, the aircraft took off; the fasten seatbelts remained on for 45 minutes; briefly went off, before a turbulence warning from the pilot for a super-mild 15 secs of turbulence, followed by another 45 minutes of fasten-seatbelts. All the while, the Cabin Services Staff were going about there business of preparing food, ignoring customers and on one sector, telling me I couldn't use the toilet;
""""back to your seat, the seatbelts light is on!"""" - to which I answered ' I can either do it in my seat or in the toilet' before being snapped at 'it's at your own risk!' Bear in mind, their had been only 15 seconds of mild turbulence 45 minutes previously.
I have no complaints about the food; no comment about the non-existent drinks service before dinner or the non-existent tea / coffee after dinner.
Of the '13' Stewards there for our 'safety and comfort' - I only saw 4 at the dinner service; the rest were strangely absent; while after the dinner service the 4 on duty were on the whole, completely unavailable.
All 4 sectors were like this; such that this is clearly a 'policy' rather than an exception;
""""Get them on; get the seatbelts light on at every opportunity; don't do a pre-dinner refreshments service; don't top up their drinks; don't offer any other service and do be as rude as possible and ignore the customers wherever possible; but smile on boarding and disembarkation."""" 
My neighbours had planned to fly Emirates from BHX to Cape Town this year and next; they fly 3 times a year; This experience has put them off so much, that they have stated they prefer to  be driven 2 hours to LHR and pay extra for each flight on a competitor airline, rather than undergo the ordeal that was 20+ hours to Mauritius with just 2 refreshments served as part of Dinner and be subjected to the humiliation of being ignored by Cabin Staff.
Personally, I will absolutely pay extra to fly with any other airline than Emirates now; truly, unbelievably appalling.

My hand luggage met all the size and weight restrictions listed on the Emirates website. However, at the boarding gate, the crew asked me to check it in because the flight was full and there wouldn't be enough space in the overhead compartments.

While I understand this happening in a full flight, what bothered me was that the crew seemed to be asking mostly passengers who appeared to be Filipino, like myself, or those who weren't very assertive to decline checking their bags. It felt like they were being singled out.

Since I had valuables in my cabin luggage, I politely declined to check it in. The crew member insisted, which made me feel pressured and uncomfortable. There was a general unease, and heightened anxiety as the boarding queue grew longer while my husband and I were being asked to check in our hand luggage.

I explained that I couldn't check them in due to valuables and I do not have a safety lock. The crew member persisted by asking if I was """"prepared to take the risk"""" of my luggage being left behind, which came across as coercive, and intimidating. However, I managed to keep my bags, but the whole situation left a bad taste in my mouth.

My husband and I paid for tickets that included the advertised hand luggage allowance on the Emirates website. There was no clear communication about managing hand luggage in full flights.

Overall, I was disappointed with how the crew handled this situation. It felt unfair and made boarding stressful. If you're flying with Emirates and have valuables in your cabin luggage, be prepared to stand your ground if they ask you to check it in. If you value having your cabin luggage with you and have valuables inside, you may want to consider this experience when choosing an airline."

On the aforementioned date, I was traveling with my sister and my two young children. Upon attempting to board our flight, the security guard in question accused me of not resembling my passport photo, causing undue stress and delay. Despite my repeated assurances and suggestions to prove my identity, including the provision of my credentials as a licensed physician, he refused to accept any form of verification other than an identity card or driving license‚Äîneither of which I am mandated to carry while traveling.

My specific complaints are as follows:

Baseless Accusation: The security guard randomly accused me of not looking like my passport photo. I travel frequently and have never encountered such an accusation. 

Lack of Consultation: The guard did not seek a second opinion or consult a superior regarding his doubts. It is standard protocol to seek additional verification in such cases, and his failure to do so exacerbated the situation.

Unprofessional Interference: After we were finally allowed to proceed, I approached an Emirates manager to file a complaint. The security guard intervened, attempting to dissuade me from filing the complaint by insisting he was merely doing his job.

Failure to Verify Identity Through Questions: The guard did not ask me any questions to confirm my identity. Despite my repeated offers to answer any questions and provide proof, he disregarded all my efforts. This left me feeling powerless and vulnerable, especially with sick children in my care.

This entire episode lasted over an hour, causing significant emotional distress and nearly resulting in a missed flight. The situation was further exacerbated by my concern for my sick child, leading to an emotional breakdown.

 I believe that corrective action should be taken against the security guard involved, whether through additional training or disciplinary measures."

No announcement was made - I had to ask the stewardess why the screen was not working. Hence I could not watch any movies. I was unable even to turn on the light so I could read. Eventually they `rebooted the system' and  it worked for about an hour before collapsing again - again no announcement and it did not work for the remainder of the journey. The food was terrible. I had butter chicken as the main dish. The chicken was grisly and inedible. The rest of the plate was not much better, including even the desert. Very unimpressed as I had paid extra to go premium economy. I tried to put in a complaint to Emirates online, but their system demands a ticket number - there was no ticket number on my travel documents so I could not proceed. 
On the way home, I went on Emirates from Amsterdam to Dubai - 7 hours. One screaming 3 year old throwing tantrums every few minutes with parents who just sat there, made the journey unbearable. At least the food was better this time. On the next leg of the journey, Dubai to Australia,  we had 13 hours with two 9 month old twins screaming in the seats directly in front of us, and parents who were constantly getting up and moving up and down past our seat, generally causing disruption.

I traveled from Zanzibar to Dubai with my final destination being London Heathrow (LHR). The details of my complaint are as follows:

While waiting for our connecting flight in Dubai, one of my travel companions started experiencing severe chest pains. We promptly informed Emirates staff, who took appropriate action by arranging for medical assessment and monitoring. Subsequently, a decision was made that she should stay in Dubai to receive medical treatment. My other friend stayed with her to provide support, while I continued with the flight to London to avoid additional costs.

Upon my arrival at LHR, I was informed that my luggage had been left in Dubai. Shockingly, it was handed over to my friend who remained in Dubai, despite it clearly having my tag on it. This raises serious questions about your luggage handling procedures and security protocols.

It has now been three days, and my luggage is still in Dubai. Your customer service advised that my friend should return to the airport in Dubai to hand over the luggage, which she did. However, when she arrived, the airport staff refused to accept it, claiming that she should not have taken it in the first place. This contradictory and inefficient handling of the situation has left me appalled and deeply frustrated.

Emirates prides itself on being one of the best airlines, but this experience has severely tarnished that image. The way your staff handled my luggage situation, especially during a stressful time involving a medical emergency, was far below acceptable standards."

I would like to express my profound disappointment and frustration with the service provided by various departments, particularly customer support / claim department, following the cancellation of my flight from Vienna to Male last April due to the recent floods in Dubai.

While I completely understand the circumstances surrounding the flight cancellation, the issue lies with the abysmal customer support I have encountered since then. Upon requesting a certificate for insurance purposes- 02.05., I was informed that I would need to wait 30 days for processing, which I accepted as part of the procedures. However, upon receiving the certificate after the specified period, it was found to be incorrect for both myself and my travel companion.

Subsequent attempts to rectify this error have been met with further delays and inefficiencies. Despite being advised to fill out another form for follow-up, it has now been 2 months since my initial request, and I am still awaiting the correct certificates. The lack of assistance and communication from customer support has been appalling, with promises to escalate the issue to the relevant department unfulfilled and no resolution in sight.

As a loyal customer of Emirates Airlines, recognized for its excellence in flight services, I am deeply dismayed by the subpar level of customer support and service provided in this instance. The unresolved issue with the certificates has also led to a delay in processing the insurance claim, further exacerbating the situation.

It is truly disheartening to experience such incompetence and negligence from a company of Emirates' caliber. The disparity between the exceptional flight services and the inadequate customer support is not only disappointing but also unacceptable."

(flight EK 775).  I encountered many problems during my travels home.

- firstly upon arrival to Dubai international airport, no one assisted us with our baggage from the emirates pick up. We had to push our own trolleys to counter whilst other passengers had people running to assist them with offloading their bags and pushing their trolleys 
- At the check in counter at Dubai international airport the emirates attendant who assisted us with checking in our luggage was extremely rude, refused to greet us and refused to treat  us with the same level of respect as he gave everyone else infront of us. My one bag weighed 34kgs and my other 18kgs the man made me unpack my bags to make sure my bag was 32kgs. But the passenger infront of me in the check in line, bags weighed 39kgs and 30 kgs and the attendant just let it go and gave him a warning for next time. I overheard the entire conversation but yet when it came to my luggage he was persistent that I must go repack and come back. I brought this to one of the emirates supervisors attention and he too was very unhelpful  and before giving me a solution or answer he walked away and assisted another passenger whilst I was still talking to him, I find this very rude and unacceptable when I asked him to provide me with his details he refused to as I told him I will Be taking this matter further . I understand the baggage policy,  but what is concerning is the double standards applied by your staff in implementing these regulations. Do rules only apply to certain passengers from certain countries? Please can you follow up with your cameras in the airport to see the evidence for yourself. 
- Lastly on the plane my pregnant wife‚Äôs seat (seat 9A on EK 775)  was broken and 3 hours out of our 8 hour journey was spent by the cabin crew trying to fix and ‚Äòreboot‚Äô the seat. She was unable to lay comfortably bearing in mind she is 18 week pregnant or even watch anything on her screen whilst they attempted to fix the problem. Which was deemed unfixable in the air. They couldn‚Äôt offer her another seat as the plane was full, according to the cabin crew. The one cabin crew member wrote an incident report apparently please May you follow it up with him. This MAJOR INCONVENIENCE, disrupted our entire journey and travels home was far from luxurious and made our trip miserable and left emirates in a bad light. We paid a lot of money for these tickets and I find quite unacceptable we are provided with broken seats and equipment. These things should be checked prior to departure. I would also like to know how we will be compensated for this major inconvenience and what will be done to rectify the situation as these matters are unacceptable for passengers travelling in premium classes such as business class 
- I am a doctor, I know they are many risks associated with pregnancy and travel such as  deep vein thrombosis, one of the reasons I booked business class seats were to ensure my wife was luxurious and comfortable during her journey and unfortunately she was robbed of that. 

As mentioned above I regularly travel with emirates on an annual basis. Never have I ever encountered such a bad experience with emirates. I know you guys strive to provide luxury and comfort both of which my wife and I were denied during or recent travel. The service we were provided was absolutely shocking and not up to the standard emirates provide. I am very disappointed and if this is how were are going to be treated I would much rather travel with another airline that values, respects and prioritises their premium passengers. And should this matter not receive the necessary attention I will be taking this matter further.

As mentioned above, I would like to know how my wife and I will be compensated for this major inconvenience.

My wife and I have been loyal customers of Emirates Airlines for more than 15 years. We have amassed many thousands of Emirates Airmiles. However, we have concluded their Airmiles Scheme is a Con.  
We have travelled with Emirates many times in Business and First Class to Australia and the Far East and back to Manchester and spent well over ¬£30,000 with them and have earned many thousands of Airmiles.  We regularly receive emails from Emirates telling us how valuable our Airmiles are and how they can be used when booking our next flight. They say our Airmiles have been upgraded to Silver Standard.  
However, whenever we‚Äôve booked new flights and tried to apply our Airmiles, Emirates would not allow us to use them. This is according to the Travel Agents.  In February 2024, we booked our flights directly with Emirates ourselves. These were for BUSINESS CLASS seats to Hong Kong, returning to Manchester from Shanghai.  When booking these directly by phone, we asked Emirates to use our Airmiles.  He said he‚Äôd credited them to our tickets.   When our tickets arrived, we discovered the Ticketing Agent had lied and, once again, Emirates had not credited the Airmiles to our tickets.  We then complained.  Our booking phone conversation was listened to by an Emirates Manager and she confirmed we had asked for our Airmiles to be credited and their Ticketing Agent had said he‚Äôd applied them to our tickets. However, she then said, we would not be able to complain further or ask for any compensation until we had taken the flights.
Since returning, we have sent many letters to the Emirates Complaints Portal. They reply only to say they will not offer us any monetary compensation. They added insult to injury, by offering us 15,000 extra Airmiles, which we knew would be valueless. 
Additionally, when we were booking our last flight, we asked for Direct Flights and were told they were, but when taking the flight to Hong Kong we found we were being diverted to call in at Bangkok.  There, we had to sit on the runway for over 2 hours while Airport Workers scurried around us cleaning the aircraft cabin.  
After many letters of complaint, Emirates say they will not offer any compensation and our Case in now closed.  We Vow never to fly with Emirates ever again."

At the end of the day is just something material but I loss all my money because their customer support it was just asking and asking same information every single time that I called them until I got the point that I got tired. I would never use this airline ever, it was my first time and my last time. their own email confirmation was provided showing them their mistake but they do not accept their own mistake and I am the one losing.

I took the EK533 & the EK241 on 11th June 2024 & 12th June 2024 on the COK-DXB & the DXB-YYZ sectors.

EK-533. 11-06-24. Seat no 27 G -Madhu Nair. 
The breakfast served (Akuri-Parsi style scrambled eggs, with veggies) was COLD. When told to be reheated, the request was noted-unfortunately without any action or follow up. I asked for warm water as I had a sore throat. The Egyptian service associate/cabin crew, -mentioned he will get back, but alas-again no action. I did not have the breakfast (as it was cold and would have worsened my throat). The warm water did not come. The cabin crew seemed hassled and in a unrequired hurry. Hot beverage not served, though asked for. Blamed it on the minor turbulence seen for a short while!! Overall, a grossly below par experience.
--------------------------
EK241-DXB-YYZ-12/06/24, Seat no 59C-Madhu Nair.
While most of the journey was hassle-free, the meal served on the day of arrival was a disaster.
I had asked for non veg (clearly informed during the booking stage). Afte a lot of huddles between the cabin crew on the said aisle/front/middle galley, I was told that non-veg has run out and that ‚Äúwe‚Äù are trying to figure out a way. I finished my salad, bread and dessert-after which Ms Nichita (the responsible cabin crew), said we can offer you the veg-paneer option! Being already put off, I did not want to have the main course after the dessert!
In short 2 meals served on 2 different sectors both could not be consumed-one because it came ice cold and the second did not arrive on my palate at all.
Toilet cleanliness on bot flights-needed a lot lot more improvement to be anywhere close to World Class standards. On the EK-241-DXB-YYZ sector I had to use the front toilets (near the exit-front galley). I was surprised to see poop on the toilet seat & tissues lying all across a wet floor!. Poop on the toilet seat was a disaster!!!
In short-my experience over the 17+ hours of flying aboard the Emirates was well short of expectations. On a scale of 5, I would rate it as 2-i.e. 2/5.
Trust my feedback (given purely as a well-wisher), will reign in change on these hospitality basics & basic checks. Whilst you do not get a 2nd chance to make a 1st impression, last impressions could be lasting impressions!
I hope my return flight early next year on the same Emirates Airlines, makes me change my opinion.

My first action was to check in my cell phone where it was using a tracking mode by Air tag, the air tag was in the Baggage and at that moment I saw the exact location in Dubai airport. I went to the mishandled baggage, filled up the customs form for mishandled baggage before I left the New Delhi airport, The employee told me the baggage will be located as soon as possible and will be delivery in my hotel. I gave to him the address and date where I would be in India until April 29. At the same day April 21 I sent a e-mail for Mhbdelek@emirates.com explain my lost.
Next day April 22 the baggage was send to New Delhi airport as the air tag was showing but no buddy called to give me this information. Next day April 23 I called Emirates to get some information about delivery as day and time, unsuccessfully.  I was oriented to send other e-mail with more information as pictures and reference number, than I sent again to Mhbdelek@emirates.com, and informing my reference number DELA1579204.
Day April 24th no return. With out any assistance I decided to call again, and the employee told me the baggage was in Montreal, I had to inform him what was happening, no success again.

Last time I was stranded in Dubai for 36 hours on a flight between Manchester and New Zealand. This time I have been delayed in Sydney for about the same time. I only flew with them again because I got a voucher due to my experience last time, and because I figured that had to be a one off. How wrong I was.

While mechanical issues happen with planes, it is the communication and customer service from Emirates that has been diabolical this time around. My flight was supposed to leave at 20:10. We were eventually told it wasn't flying at 23:00, after nearly three hours of incremental delays. 

The airline then made us stand in a queue for 2 hours to be allocated a hotel for the night - no food or water was given to passengers who, by this time, had been waiting for nearly 5 hours. At one point, they ran out of hotel rooms to allocate passengers to, and we were eventually taken to a really rundown (think cockroaches and stains on the wall) hotel, about 30 mins drive from Sydney airport. Still no food, no water. I was told by the staff at the airport that I would be able to get food at the hotel when I arrived - this turned out to be wrong. I finally got into bed at 2 AM, 6 hours after my flight was supposed to leave.

At the airport, we had been informed that by the time we woke up the next morning, we would have flights rebooked for us for our onward journey. I woke up, no flights. After several attempts to make contact with Emirates, I was rebooked onto a flight which required a 14 hour connection wait in Dubai. My original booking had only a two hour connection.

The hotel staff in Sydney were great, but they were unable to contact Emirates the morning after the cancellation. This was important because we had only been booked to that hotel for one of our two night stay in Sydney, so we didn't know if we had to check out the next night. Also, still no food vouchers or any contact from the airline itself. The reason that they were unable to contact Emirates is that Emirates only ever rang them from a hidden caller ID number, they were quite literally hiding from their passengers. 

Having flown similar routes (UK to Australia/New Zealand) several times, my advise is to avoid Emirates. Save yourself some money, hassle and time, and book with Etihad, Qatar or Qantas"

Most importantly, 2 out of 2 times I flew with them, I was delayed for multiple hours.
The first time it was just sitting on the plane with no AC for 2 hours, and the second was 3+ hours, due to some trivial problem with their cabin lights.
That 2nd time I had a connecting flight to catch, and while on board they assured me it would be fine, and I did in fact make it to the gate while they were still boarding, they refused to board me due to having apparently unilaterally decided to rebook me to a flight 11 hours later, assuming I wouldn't make it. Turns out there were earlier flights available, but they wouldn't book me to them due to not code-sharing with those airlines. Not only was no compensation offered for this day-long delay, but when I finally booked a separate flight on my own, they wouldn't even refund me, and had me request it on my own online. Overall they just showed 0 willingness to help throughout the entire process, despite it being 100% their fault, for a delay caused by them and between flights both of which they operated.
They made it as painful as it possibly could be, every step of the way.

Oh, and the flights themselves were also bad - old-looking airplanes, terrible food, and relatively limited entertainment.
Emirates might have earned a positive reputation due to their First Class experience, but for Economy flights, it's probably the worst airline I've ever used."

We were aware a few days prior to us leaving that there had been floods in Dubai and the airport was affected but when our flight left only delayed a few hours we assumed things must have recovered and all was back on track, boy were we wrong. Turns out flights were still landing but not many taking off. Due to our flight delay we missed our original connecting flight (although we are unsure if this flight actually left or not) and were left to queue (more like a mosh pit) with thousands of other stranded travellers some who had been at the airport for 3 days for 8hrs. I believe Emirates  should never have sent us into Dubai until flights were departing again and the backlog of travelers had been cleared.

On my flight there were several incorrect orders (I was served appetiser and dessert at the same time but no main course).

People at the front of business are left with their food trays for almost an hour. It is dire! Certainly far better options to explore in future (and I‚Äôve always been a fan of Emirates).

3.66722059249878,7.58369493484497,"Emirates Refund Issues",2,"Emirates Airline is a well known and well loved airline by many that much is clear. While I was at the hotel in Dubai I realized that they spent millions of dollars in commercials featuring attractive and friendly passengers and flight attendants to appeal to the customer sense of beauty. Clearly this marketing is effective and even their selection of flight attendants from all over the world seems to lineup with their emphasis on aesthetics. 

This is a moment where I will point out a lesson I learned many years ago in Sunday school about being outwardly beautiful but inwardly rotten and that we should focus on our heart inside more than how we appear to others. All this is to say that customer service was lacking as a result of the millions spent in marketing. Now in order to make such a statement I should provide evidence and so I shall do my best to do just that. The great Dubai flood of April 2024 was a logistical nightmare for the city with damages and cleanup as well as the airline there is no question. The inability of the airline to handle rebooking and cancellations and the mayhem that was Dubai Airport after the unforeseen excessive rain is not entirely their fault but again I turn back to the lesson. Emirates sponsors football clubs and spends millions more on the aforementioned advertising that when their is chaos due to massive delays that was caused by weather events they seemingly were unable to adequately manage or staff simple lines at their counter. Many people were waiting for several hours in a line to reach the front only to find out the line was closed or wasn‚Äôt staffed. Of the 10-15 possible lines only 3-4 in the 3 hours I waited to rebook would be open at a time instead of all 15 which should have been the case. Now at some point during the wait they did provide snacks to people in line which was a nice gesture but due to the massive debacle which was beyond Emirates control it might have made more sense for them to call some of those attractive actresses from the commercial to work the lines so that their image of beauty did not get obliterated due to the breakdown of order that occurred due to so many delays and cancellations. 

However, after the three hour wait to get to the woman at the desk it should be noted that in spite having dealt with many irate and unhappy customers that they were still incredibly friendly and helpful for rebooking. The lesson here was that not all the attendants were so helpful and part of that was the obvious frustration many passengers were experiencing over everything but all these issues could have been reduced greatly by opening every line and adequately staffing their airport lines during an unexpected but extensive delay causing event would have helped them avoid many negative reviews especially those from April.

Also, I must say now that the only reason I went to the airport at all was because the live chat system was overwhelmed and it as impossible to get through to a customer service agent and rather than simply provide an email for changing flights that would be cumbersome would eventually alleviate the strain on their live chat and call center folks as well as those at that airport but again one must remember the emphasis on appearance often detracts from substance and not everything that glitters is gold.

Finally the day of the flight arrives and lo and behold it rained again and there were delays going back that was beyond the control of the Emirates and while many passengers were frustrated and grumbling it did nothing by their disregarding requests to return to seats as the delays went on and on whether passengers were seated or standing. In fact nearly 3.5 hours after the flight was supposed to depart which again is no fault of the airline but in all that time water or orange juice was never served to Economy Class. Granted the business and first class passengers paid thousands more so it‚Äôs understandable that their food and drink and silverware would be ready for them upon entry and again there are many more Economy passengers than business and first class combined but as a result of the lack of service the whole plane turned into people shouting for water or juice and eventually some Economy passengers who complained loud enough or often enough got drinks but this was a slow and painfully loud process. Also the legroom is awful which even for Economy class could and should be a little better at least. 

The food was good but the lack of organizing of Emirates became apparent once again when many people who had requested Vegetarian and or Vegan meals did not receive them initially even though they showed evidence they had selected them when booking tickets. Sadly, the meal size was enough to barely take away hunger for long periods and in between meals there were not often snacks but to be fair to the flight attendants they were ruffled and frustrated from all the exchanges they had with justifiably angry passengers but regardless of the frustration which I shared I was reminded of the need for courtesy from Don Quixote and a life lesson that can help impulsive people is that while the pawns and low level workers are often the most accessible they are seldom responsible for poor planning and execution of service. Anyways, as annoying as it was to have poor service on an airline that spends so much to project a great image one should not forget that most of the flight attendants have struggles in life as well and so more understanding would have went a long way for a quieter flight even if food and drink service was slower than molasses.

I really like the movie selection and music selection on flight and there was enough of both of those to distract from the hunger left from what I would argue were tasty meals but better suited for Oompah Loom-pas than people. So overall would I fly Emirates again? Sure but I would lower expectations a lot and not have high expectations of a luxury airline at least as it relates to Economy Class so unless I become rich soon Economy class with small meals and little legroom will be my fate despite what the attractive commercials Emirates show on the television but lesson learned on my end once again tv is not reality even when they call it reality tv."
4.65050029754639,5.05188226699829,"Emirates Airline Hospitality",1,"This letter serves as a formal complaint regarding the unacceptable service I received on Emirates flight EK 41 from Dubai to London on the 12th of May 2024. 
As a loyal Emirates customer since 2009, I was deeply disappointed by the experience, which fell far below the standards I have come to expect from your business-class service. The night before my flight, I specifically contacted Emirates through your chat portal to inquire about the availability of immunity kits on board. The representative confirmed I would receive one, prompting me to leave mine at the check-in desk. Unfortunately, upon arrival in Dubai after a long journey starting at 3 am, no immunity kit was provided on the flight to London. This unexpected lapse caused significant inconvenience, especially considering my lack of sleep. 
Due to the aforementioned lack of sleep, I requested a two-hour nap upon takeoff and asked the cabin crew to prepare lunch for me upon waking. However, upon requesting lunch, a male crew member reacted aggressively and offered only a single pie. This behavior was unprofessional and unacceptable. Furthermore, when another crew member intervened, the options presented were limited to a further pie, an unappetizing chocolate cake, and a small box of chocolates. This felt more akin to leftover offerings rather than the high-quality meals I expect from business class. Additionally, the water glass provided was dirty, further diminishing the overall dining experience. 
The entire experience significantly detracted from the value proposition of Emirates Business Class. In comparison to other airlines I have flown within the year, Emirates service fell demonstrably short. This is particularly concerning as I have consistently chosen Emirates since 2009 and have never encountered such a decline in service standards. As a business traveler, I prioritize a professional and well-organized environment. The aforementioned incidents demonstrate a clear disregard for such standards. Given that I will be flying back with Emirates later next week, I have serious reservations about the quality of service I can expect. 

Furthermore, one week following my flight, I received a response from an Emirates customer case agent acknowledging my concerns.  However, the response provided no substantive resolution.  The agent simply stated that the crew had been informed and advised me to speak to a crew supervisor on future flights.  This response not only fails to address the specific issues I raised, but also reinforces a sense of unprofessionalism within Emirates' customer service department.

This experience has led me to believe that Emirates is experiencing a significant decline in service quality.  To this end, I intend to share my experience with other potential customers on various travel review platforms."

The small airport had served 3 flights with over 600 passengers by a few staffs there with only beer, wine, snacks and no bread or even water or accommodations services. They only served the food support on second day. 

Emirates seems to block all complaints submissions from the passengers that's why I couldn't send them the suggestion of delay reason confirmation for travelling insurance requirements :( . I acknowledge the crisis due to unexpected natural impacts but at least they must support the passengers to claim the significant loss they have been suffering to the traveling insurance requirements for the delay reason confirmation.

I was really impressed with the flight.
The seats were comfortable.
The entertainment channels were very varied with more than enough channels.
The evening meal of shrimp and noodles was great.
There was also internet available, WhatsApp, Telegram etc for free, and other upgrades if you required.
Were were given the obligatory pack with socks, eye shades and a tooth brush and paste.
However the breakfast of, I think it was called ' pulled beef' left a lot to be desired.

Ok, lets start with the seats. They were great, virtually 'lie flat' and spacious.
There was no internet at all throughout the flight.
The flight pack was very good.
The evening 'snacks were really tasty, however the morning breakfast, I had the omelette was dry and unappetizing.
Oh, and the entertainment was very limited, not nearly as good as the previous economy flight.

Obviously it's not a cheap way to travel but fortunatly I ended up saving enough air miles to indulge myself on that flight. Check in at Athens airport went smooth. There's dedicated lines for premium passengers for check in and boarding, as well as to clear security and immigration. I had access to the Skyserv lounge just after the shops which was good and provided a few things to eat and drinks. There's showers to this lounge but there's an extra charge unless you have a specific status. I was selected for an random extra security check before boarding which I was aware with the SSSS on my boarding pass but it was a quick narcotics swap on my belongs and my tablet. Fortunalty it took less than 5 minutes where some places specially in the US can be a nightmare and very annoying and inconvinient. Boarding process was also fine. The aircraft was a Boeing 777 featuring the standard cabin suite. This aircraft type does not have showers on board and a few aircraft have a better suite depending on the destination. I was impress with my suite, with my spacious seat as well as the minibar with a push of a button. The colors and the materials used for the suite gave a luxurious, relaxing and joyful vibe for the entire flight. The cabin crew was professional, nice and effecient despite being a bit discrete. They were available any time if you wanted something. The service and the amenities on board were top noch. I was provide with an amenity kit which included expensive brand product given in a bag with nice pyjamas and slippers. I had to try that expensive caviar paired with champagne. The portion was big and I couldn't finish it but it was good but a bit too much for me. I was eating for 3-4 hours  out of the 10 hour flight so much that I had a food coma. Despite the filet mignon was a bit overcooked the food was tasty and delicious. I couldn't take the desert but I asked to have it later after my nap on the comfy seat which turn into a cozy bed. The inflying entertaiment was very extensive with a big selection of content in different languages. What I enjoyed the most is to relax while lounging in the luxourious, comfortable and spacious seat while enjoying a nice scotch and see outside from the 3 windows. This cabin product is similar to the Qsuite of Qatar Airways which is as good as this suite. Perhaps this was my best travel experience.

The service from the cabin crew varies greatly from route to route - some are absolutely phenomenal, while others are very unstructured with both food service and cleaning up after meals - some are terribly slow, to put it nicely.
In Business Class, I have only positive feedback regardless of which route I have travelled. A big advantage for us are the 2-seat rows in Economy Class, which we usually pay extra to sit on. (a bit expensive) The quality of the food is good, as good as it can be in the air... they are good at having food for those with various allergies, which is served just before the main service. This is a general description after traveling many times with Emirates for a few years now, but it should be mentioned that now, especially after the pandemic, we have experienced bad and condescending behavior in Economy Class, almost like they don't like their job - it is very disappointing and not what I expect from Emirates.
If the bad behavior continues, we will of course use other companies. You can do so much better, we know that from previous experiences."

Granted there was a thunderstorm & flooding, the lack of contingency planning from Emirates was the real reason behind all the sh*tty experiences we encountered during this trip! 

Eventually, we reached DXB but our flight there to Madrid just kept getting delayed from a few minutes to hours UNTIL IT GOT CANCELLED! Wtf, if it was just going to be cancelled, the passengers should‚Äôve been told so from the beginning! There were literally no Emirates crew in the gates as well to explain what the hell was going on. Had to sleep for 2 NIGHTS in DXB & everyone had to line up for hours in awful long queues just to get their cancelled flights rebooked. We, in economy class, got ZERO compensation for being stuck in DXB for 3 days! People were squatting on the grounds of the airport, everyone had to use public toilets, no shower, buy overpriced food & necessities just to survive the hell Emirates put us through. 

It doesn‚Äôt end there. When we eventually flew to our destination on the 3rd day (April 18), we thought everything was over. WE WERE SO WRONG! We stood beside the luggage carousel for so long, waiting for our baggages to appear in front of us but of course, Emirates screwed up the luggages of their passengers as well. I cannot imagine how many other people had to experience what we endured, how many other people had to go on with their trips WITHOUT LUGGAGES.

Firstly, the cabin crew only provided hygiene kits to a selected few passengers and when asked regarding this the stewardess response was the only a small amount of kits were loaded on the plane for our 13 hour flight. So I would expect that if you are not able to provide the kits to all passengers then maybe do not supply to only a few and have all of the middle and right side of the plan from rows 43 and back not receive any kits. Then the next worst encounter with the flight crew was during meal service the stewardess dropped a full cup of orange juice into my lap and I was completely wet with my Gucci linen pants stained with juice. I was given 3 napkins and when I mentioned I do not have a carry on to grab a spare set of pants to change and asked if there was anything the airline could provide for me to change into I was told she would find me a blanket to cover my legs with and told me to use the rest room to try to clean my pants. I asked again are their any pajama pants or lounge wear pants that can be provided so I would not have to sit in a confined seat for 13 hours wet and I was told no and asked did I still want another blanket. Horrible service and I sat wet for hours until my pants somewhat dried and are now ruined. After this fiasco occurred I was then asked if I didn‚Äôt mind moving to another seat because there was another passenger that was seated beside a male passenger and due to religious beliefs she could not be seated beside a male during the flight. I was so frustrated and upset I literally began to cry and I could not even respond I just hung my head and sobbed. This was the worst experience I have ever had to encounter on a flight with an airline I had heard so many great things about online. And I was so excited to fly Emirates airlines but this experience has left me shaken and hurt by the way in which I was treated and no one ever once said I‚Äôm so sorry for all that had happened. And to come to me after all that had happened and ask if I would move my seat was just bullish and so inconsiderate of the stewardess. I have traveled to Greece, Spain, Bali, Mexico, Bermuda, Bahamas, Jamaica, Turks, with long flights and layovers and I have never ever experienced treatment such as that on any airline it just sickens me to think that it was just seen as ok that day and I can‚Äôt imagine being part of the flight crew and treating anyone the way in which I was treated.

The flight has been delayed for appx 2 hours because of technical issue. We can accept that there is always delay in journey and the crew members has said sorry for that. But we have another flight after that back home from BKK to HAN, and this is not a connecting flight, which means I have to enter Bangkok, take my checked-in luggage, check in with Vietnamairline again and go through the immigration again. I totally understand that the following flight is just not a connecting flight with Emirate and we have to accept. As soon as the flight from Dubai landing to BKK airport, I and 7 people was really in hurry to get out of the aircraft and asked the crew member that we need their support to get out of this aircraft but the the crew members were too rigid with their policy, no even smiling but with a cold face and keep us waiting the other passengers got out first (as we were sitting in the upper deck of the aircraft). I was so surprised with this actions from crew members even we insisted that we are being for the next flight because of their fault. If some of us have no Platimum member card from Vietnamairline to be at check-in counter and asked for not closing the counter, I strongly believe that all of us can not depart for the next flight. Strange, I cannot understand why Emirates sent an email saying that we were offered  complimentary food and drink at any of the participating restaurants at Dubai International Airport (DXB) because my  journey was disrupted when the flight already landed to BKK :) it means no passengers can get this offer.

Just one problem we flew with Emirates!!!!!.
Flew from LHR to Dubai then onto Bali.
Bit of a delay on the Dubai to Bali flight but  that's expected these days even though its annoying.
Finally arrived in Bali, minus our luggage, which we were told might arrive tomorrow!! it wasn't just our luggage it was everybody elses on our flight.
 Lots of pushing and shoving we had to get a missing baggage claim form which we eventually got! Not very well organised a very small office for five hundred people plus!!!
We left the airport 4hrs after arriving as we had a transfer to hotel organised.
Next day we had to get a taxi back to the airport to hand in the missing luggage claim form.
Managed to speak to somebody and submitted form for our luggage. (You will be given a reference number for each piece of luggage) We were told our luggage would be arriving on a flight later that night. We were moving hotels everynight and said it would need to be delivered as we were on a tour of Bali. (This was Monday) (taxi back to hotel)!
Tuesday spoke to  Emirates staff  who explained our luggage  had arrived but it would be a while before it would become available as it would have to clear customs!  Tried to track luggage on Emirates tracking site but same message: luggage would be arriving on Monday evening  do not attempt to collect luggage until you are contacted by  Emirates!
  
Wednesday. Again tried to contact Emirates as we had heard nothing, phone line was constantly engaged and tracking site same message: to not attempt to collect luggage until Emirates contacts you.!!!

Wednesday evening we had  had enough  decided to go to airport. Another taxi!
Got to Airport and finally got through to Emirates, who new we were after our luggage. While there we saw a large group of people, quite angry  got speaking to them, they had been waiting for their luggage 10 days.
Finally we were all escorted through numerous lifts scanners etc until we were faced with a floor full of what must of been over 500 cases, bags.
Within 2 minutes, found our luggage. Went straight to Emirates compensation office and gave them a few choice words, explaining we wanted to be compensated for delayed luggage, inconvenience, taxis to and from the airport, missing some excursions on our tour due to chasing our luggage.
They offered us ¬£37 for our troubles. I refused said I want ¬£300, ¬£100 for each day without luggage. Eventually got ¬£225 which we got cash in local currency. We asked for more but would of had to wait until our return to UK to claim.

Will never Fly Emirates again, for a super wealthy airline they don't really care about you or your luggage. No contact, just waiting for people to collect they're luggage, while telling them to wait until they are contacted before collecting.
They had no intention of delivering luggage.
So be warned  we have learnt our lesson, never again. 
If you are reading this and waiting on your luggage, take the initiative go to the airport and collect, don't wait for them to contact you. Also ensure you go to the compensation desk and get money for you troubles.

Good luck@

Our driver arranged for a skycap and our entry to the airport was seamless.

After check in and TSA we went to the business class lounge and it too was lovely.  There were many food options that were continually replaced and the servers working there were plentiful and pleasant. Boarding was easy as all business class passengers board separately and from a higher level as the seats are at the top of the aircraft.

The flight attendants were welcoming and even took my heavy carry on and placed it in the overhead bin. Other airlines ignore your request for help and they rely on other passengers to assist. The flight continued with warm and friendly attention and special service for children. Smiles abound and requests are all made possible.  I always order fish as an entree and never eat it as it is so bad, on Emirates it was delicious!

Beds are made with mattresses and blankets and pajamas are given.  The entertainment has boundless choices.  The rear of business class has many restrooms that are continually cleaned. There is a bar area in the rear for gathering and drinks and snacks are continually available. There is a couch to sit with others.

2. Checking luggage: after carefully weighing the luggage at home, the airport scale shows it was a little over, usually other airline would let it pass, but not this one. I was made to throw out my stuff so the weight would be within its limit. My cabin case which contain change of clothing and some gifts was also weighed, and no issue with the hand luggage. 
Boarding: after security I was left with little time to spare for boarding, on the way to the gate I hurriedly bought some food stuff and cakes from duty free. My mistake for not taking receipts. Upon boarding, the staff stopped me and demand to weigh everything, including my hand bag and duty free purchases. Not only that, they threatened the plane would leave in three minutes if I don‚Äôt throw out the excess, or pay $30 for each excess kg. At the end I ended throwing out everything except my iPad, camera and a cardigan to wear when I get to the U.K. I was humiliated and traumatised at the relentless threats by 3 male staffs who treated me like a criminal in front of all other passengers.
Service: after boarding the plane, I wanted watch a movie to calm down, but there were no head set, I asked the air hostess for one, only to be told that the plane was full and there wasn‚Äôt one spare ( I did not ask for any extra).

They charge for every little add on including booking a seat. It was $181 just for one leg of my trip and that was only for a window seat. Not extra leg room. There was an issue with the seat the allocated to me and so they moved me but wouldn't let me move to one of the seats with extra leg room even though there were many open leg room seats as the cost of booking these seats was exhorbitant. And get this: I asked if they would refund my $181 if I paid the price for the extra leg room seat as I was being moved to a seat way less favourable than my original seat. They said no. I would have to pay the full cost of the new seat on top of the cost of the previous set. Then I bought the WiFi, which again, I thought was very expensive and it didn't work. I asked the flight attendant and he said I had to contact the provider - obviously I couldn't do that while I was in the air as the WiFi didn't work. When I contacted them when I was on the ground I didn't get a response. I tried to contact Emirates to raise my concerns. You can't contact them without putting an email address into their website, which I did. They told me that my email wasn't a valid email address. Yes, their food was pretty good and the seats were pretty comfortable but the customer service was poor (I'm a gold member so I wonder what they're like to other members) and they charge irrationally for every extra.

I try to keep it short, but specific. It starts with the main mistake: You (Emirates) flew us with 4 hours delay for 9 hours on the 17.04. from Manila to Dubai, knowing what was going on at the airport in Dubai. The mess was still running for a day. So my wife, my son (4y), my daughter (2y) and myself were sent to a place of chaos, without any support (especially for people in need). You couldn‚Äòt care less!
Usually we had to spend 2-3hours as transits at the airport. It went out that it were over 24hours of torture for all of us. After an disgraceful way to the cancellation of our flights we had to go to the wall of people waiting for any answers. Some of them were 12 hours in the queue still waiting.
The only way for us was to wait as well. With two little kids in the middle of tired, sad and desperate people. After two hours in the line (We were awake and struggling for almost 24hours at that time)we were rushly taken out of queue with the promise that we will be handled prioritized as well as older people around us. We gave our passports in the hand of an Emirates employee in the hope of a faster solution. After 3 hours of waiting, asking, hoping, begging, another employee came back with our passports and the passports of the elderly people next to us. The result: nothing! They didn‚Äòt hand out our passports to people in charge. They were just on any desk with no attention of everyone.
We were completely shocked and desperate. 3 hours waiting for nothing, both kids standing in front of a stinky, destroyed toilet for disabled people. So we had to wait for another 6 1/2 hours. I begged and begged and begged to 2 security guards to help us. After nearly 9 hours someone came and give us a piece of paper (not a ticket) with a kind of reservation for a flight to Hamburg/Bremen on the 23rd (6 days later!!!!). At that point my wife and I were awake for nearly 40 hours!!! So no flight, no place to sleep, no food support - nothing at all. We went to the Business Class Lounge to get any help. - They treated us like animals and sent us away (There was enough space for us 4!!). 
We were so sad, couldn‚Äòt believe what happened!! We extra booked our holiday flights with Emirates, because we thought that this company would take care of our family, especially of the children, in any situation!!! But the result was a complete nightmare. After we were sent away from your ‚Äûdesk of the rich‚Äú, we had to spend a fortune for food that was left over at the airport (5$ for a water says it all). 
In our despair we went to every gate that showed destinations in Germany. Still with both kids, hand luggage and no sleep. I was begging and almost crying to your employees to get us on a plane. Finally we could manage it to a very delayed plane to Hamburg. A lot of other people didn‚Äôt get it and were send away again. The sad thing - there were so many free seats left on the plane. The whole first class was free! People could have gone out with that plane. But they were not allowed. Same for us before for a lot of times.
At the end we are so relieved to be home. We were all in tears when we came back. 50 hours of no sleep. Almost impossible and we are still sick today. We are waiting for our luggage as well.
All in all, the ‚Äûflood‚Äú wasn‚Äòt the problem. It was the communication and the behavior to treat our little family as animals! I‚Äòm deeply disappointed and still shocked how you treated us and even brought us to that nightmare in Dubai!
I hope for your response on that case and I request a compensation!!"

We had flight to Delhi via Dubai on the 29th to be there for Easter morning. We reached at 5:10pm for 9:50pm flight. We stood in the check in line for almost 2 hours before they even acknowledged that there is a delay and then another 45 minutes before they told us the flight is cancelled. When we tried asking for them to find other options since their only next flight was the following night they said they weren‚Äôt equipped to check flights at the airport and made us call. They didn‚Äôt even know the flight is cancelled or why more confirmation that it was due to the lack of customers on Good Friday and so they rescheduled to save money. They already told us nothing was wrong with the plane and couldn‚Äôt provide any valid reason for the cancellation. Plans made months in advance and money spend for the celebration of Easter and couldn‚Äôt without any good reasoning for it. They couldn‚Äôt answer any questions or give any information it was the worst customer service I‚Äôve ever received or given. Others missed their cruises everyone was upset and they didn‚Äôt even know how to talk to us properly.. the staff walked around a lot got one another involved in each persons situation to try to figure it out. I mean each of us there talked to each of the staff to help find other options or whatever the situation may have been but no supervisor. They knew nothing, it was terrible service. Did I mention that they didn‚Äôt notify us beforehand but they knew already it was cancelled since they didn‚Äôt allow anyone to check in at the airport for that long. Then they forced to check in our carry on in Dubai because we had 3 but our infant is allocated one so harassing us when we followed the rules was even more insulting. And this is just on the way there. The day we are due to fly back as we are getting dressed I checked the app just to check and see a general notification that the flight is cancelled and all flights to Dubai is cancelled due to severe flooding again no notification on app or email or text nothing. We called at 3pm and we weren‚Äôt able to finalize rebooking till after 7pm after being on hold for 2 hours and being hung up on and having to call back. I understand it‚Äôs not their fault but providing customer service and resolving problems and situations is. Finding flights home is their main job and understanding traveling with an infant is very difficult. We had to get supervisor involved Jrose involved finally after an hour and the final result we have to fly 3 flights instead of the original 2 just to get home without being fired from work because they have no flights from Delhi. How is Emirates still running with service like this. They have no cooperation with other airlines to be able to help us in these situations their greed causes us more harm than good in these inevitable situations. Do what you‚Äôve to get us home if that means other airlines other airports then so be it but try to find the best option for the customers not for Emirates. We‚Äôve other options to fly to India in the future even if Emirates is supposed to be best and they‚Äôre terrible at least the others can find better options in these type of situations.

My journey, scheduled from HYDERABAD to  DUBAI on 17TH APRIL  was marred by  significant uncertain delays and subsequent inconveniences that deeply affected my trip.

The delay of my flight, without prior notice or sufficient explanation, initiated a chain of events that resulted in a cascade of frustrations. Not only did this disruption cause undue stress and uncertainty, but it also led to me missing an important professional function upon arrival at my destination. The inability to adhere to my commitments due to circumstances beyond my control was deeply disappointing and has implications beyond the immediate inconvenience. I waited for almost more than 52 hrs in airports of hyderbad and dubai, they did not provide me hotel to stay or lounge access. (Provided only 2 packets of chips)

Moreover, the delay in the delivery of my baggage exacerbated an already challenging situation( Still 3 bags not delivered,  after 6th day of arrival im writing this review.!!!!). Without access to my belongings, including essential items such as appropriate attire, I found myself ill-prepared and embarrassed in a professional setting. The lack of proactive communication and assistance from EMIRATES further compounded the distress of an already trying situation. I had to purchase clothes every day of my stay, which wasted my time and money. I had purchased 700$ worth of sweets and snacks from my home town, which were spoiled, and 3 bags were not even delivered. I had to be in 13 hrs queue for my boarding , which i got after 11/2 day stay at dubai airport chair.

 I had come to expect a certain standard of service and reliability. Regrettably, this experience fell far short of those expectations. While I understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, the manner in which they are managed speaks volumes about the airline's commitment to customer satisfaction.

In light of the significant disruption to my travel plans and the associated inconveniences, I believe it is reasonable to request compensation. This is not merely about seeking reparation for the financial losses incurred but also about holding the airline accountable for the impact of their service failures on their customers' lives.

In conclusion, my recent experience with [EMIRATES] has left me deeply disappointed and questioning the reliability of their service. I sincerely hope that the airline takes steps to address these issues and improve their communication, responsiveness, and customer support to prevent similar incidents in the future. This trip has costed me more than 2000$ loss( purchase of clothes, damaged food and snacks, missed function).

One observation, Manchester, Dubai and Bangkok. The Gate to depart at each airport are clearly to small to hold the amount of people travelling on an A380.

These are situated next to the toilets, the tv screen is in a section of the seat making them narrower than the regular seats and less comfy.

On April 16, 2024, my family embarked on a journey from Delhi to Vienna, with great anticipation and excitement. However, our travel experience took an unexpected turn due to heavy rains in Dubai, resulting in the cancellation of our initial flight and subsequent rebooking on a later one. Regrettably, upon our arrival in Vienna on April 17, we were surprised to discover that our luggage did not accompany us. 

Understanding the challenges your team faces during adverse weather conditions, we remained patient in the hope that our belongings would arrive safely. However, it has now been six days since our luggage was checked in at Delhi Airport, and its absence has become increasingly distressing. What compounds this situation is the critical nature of the items contained within our missing luggage. 

Vital medications essential for the well-being of my aging parents, aged 59 and 67, are among the belongings they have been deprived of for the past six days. Their health is of uttermost concern, and the absence of these medications poses a significant risk to their well-being.

Furthermore, our clothing and personal effects, including essential items for daily living, are also contained within the missing luggage. As a result, my parents find themselves with only one set of clothing each, enhancing the discomfort and inconvenience they are experiencing. I implore you to consider the gravity of our circumstances and prioritise the process of locating and delivering our luggage to us at the earliest opportunity. 

Your cooperation and prompt action in this matter would not only alleviate our current predicament but also demonstrate your commitment to customer care and satisfaction. 

In the unfortunate event that our luggage remains unaccounted for and we are compelled to incur additional expenses during our stay in Vienna, we would be compelled to seek reimbursement for any necessary purchases made to mitigate the inconvenience caused. 

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter. We eagerly await your swift resolution and the return of our belongings.

0.59257560968399,4.53057765960693,"Emirates Flight Delays",1,"Emirates - utter disgrace how we were treated !!!
This is a lengthy read but I‚Äôm sure typical of what others experienced with Emirates Airlines recently.
Emirates Airlines clearly has NO CONTINGENCY PLANNING.
We received email 17th April inviting us to check in on line for flights on 19th April EK657 Male to Dubai and EK9 Dubai to Gatwick.
We checked in on-line 17th April for both flights, seats had been previously purchased as pre-booked. Confirmation received from Emirates that on-line check-in successful.
Departed resort at 05.30am 19th April for 09.15 flight EK657 Male to Dubai.
At Emirates bag drop Male airport at about 07.00am the Emirates check-in clerk said that Emirates would only accept our bags for Dubai if we accepted that our flight ended in Dubai and that Emirates had no further travel responsibility for us.
We said to Emirates we had flight EK9 booked and confirmed for the same day of 19th April. Emirates clerk said that there were NO FLIGHTS leaving Dubai on 19th April.
We said what are we supposed to do in Dubai, and Emirates clerk said it would be down to us to find a flight with whoever we wanted and it would be down to us to find accommodation and get food etc‚Ä¶
We said to the Emirates clerk that it was down to them to get us to our final destination. The Emirates clerk disagreed and kept repeating that Emirates would only fly us to Dubai and then in effect abandon us.
With this we kept repeating that Emirates had to get us to our final destination and in the end the Emirates check-in clerk took us to the Emirates reservation desk at Male airport. That clerk spent a long time on his phone and looking at his computer. He said there were no flights out of Dubai.
We pressed him that Emirates had an obligation to get us to our final destination of London Gatwick. Eventually he suggested a flight on 27th April - he did not say what time, what flight number or even where the flight was going. That was 8 days away and we said what about accommodation and food. The Emirates clerk said it was not Emirates problem and we would have to arrange all accommodation and food ourselves.
Meanwhile and whilst these conversations were taking place and at least half a dozen power cuts at Male airport it was announced over the airport public address system that there would be no check-in of any travellers to Dubai who had onward flights from Dubai. The announcement also said that anyone flying to Dubai was required to leave the airport building due to overcrowding. So if you had no onward flight (which nobody had) you would be ejected from Dubai airport with nowhere to go and no way of knowing how or when you could fly out.
We asked Emirates about arrangements with other airlines (British Airways, Etihad, Qatar, Singapore Airlines) and the Emirates clerk stated they had no arrangement with these airlines. It starts to become increasingly apparent that Emirates has no contingency planning or disaster planning in place.
At this point we were now stranded at Male airport with Emirates Airline effectively washing their hands of any travellers going to Dubai who had onward flights.
At this point also Male airport had rapidly filled with travellers not being able to start their journeys. When we had arrived at about 06.30 it was reasonably quiet - by 10.30 there were people everywhere and a lot getting impatient and upset, many with families. It was clearly very distressing for some.
We therefore had no choice but to look at other airlines and managed to book with British Airways for 21st April at a cost of $2,700 for 2 economy tickets. This flight is to T5 Heathrow whereas our car is parked at Gatwick North, so our inconvenience will not end when we get to London.
For accommodation we made contact with the resort we had been staying at (Eriyadu) and they very professionally arranged to get us back from the airport and has provided accommodation for 2 nights - all at an additional cost to us of $860.
Emirates Airlines has to be named and shamed for an utterly contemptible and disgraceful service. They have made a small fortune in the airline business and have failed miserably when so many of their customers needed them to perform. There should be wholesale dismissals within Emirates for complete and utter incompetence, along with the highest possible corporate fines for gross negligence.
My battle will continue with Emirates to get my expenses reimbursed."

Me, my brother, and my mother were traveling by Emirates from Chennai International Airport to Boston Logan taking a connecting flight to Dubai on April 17, 2024(Wednesday) by Emirates to meet my dad. The flight check-in was at 1:00 AM and departure at 4:00 AM (IST), at first when we arrived, they said it was canceled but then said It wasn‚Äôt so after 20 minutes of confusion they let us in. Then they told us that there was a 2.5-hour delay and we left at 6:00 AM (IST) Then at 11:00(Dubai time) the pilot said there was no place to land so we circled in the air for half an hour. Then we landed but the pilot said that there were no free gates so we had to wait on the runway for legit 3 hours then we got to the airport and asked the staff there and she said that we had to get a new boarding pass by standing in a queue my mom stood in the line because I‚Äôm 12 y/o and my brother has autism and down-syndrome. Then after no joke 8 hours my mom came with the boarding passes and an accommodation(hotel) and food ticket thing. After that, we went to the nearby airport hotel but that said that it was full and told us to go down to the other hotel that was ‚Äúin the airport‚Äù but there was no such thing and after an hour of searching we found it. We had to go to the immigration place and they took the ticket and sent us OUTSIDE the airport where we went on a Shuttle bus to a hotel we were told that a shuttle would come at 4:00 AM and we could go for our 7:30 flight. But at 4:30 the shuttle still hadn‚Äôt come so we had to spend 400 AED or $108.91 on a cab and got there. My brother can‚Äôt walk a lot so my mom tried to get a wheelchair for him. And I could see a room full a wheel wheelchairs but they made us wait for one of those electric buggy‚Äôs and once we got on another group came and gave some 300 AED so they kicked us of and took them. We asked for one regular pushing wheelchair as that‚Äôs all we wanted but they said they didn‚Äôt have any even though I could see a room full a wheel wheelchairs. We waited until 7:00 then my mom decided to just lift my brother and go to the plane so she asked for his boarding pass back but he changed the topic and just said immigration was closed and didn‚Äôt give it. Then at around 10:00, they let us through and our flight would go at 11:45 AM, DELAYED 12:00, DELAYED 12:30, DELAYED 12:45 again and again until we boarded at 1:30. then we got home to logan at 9:00 PM (EST), we went through immigration and baggage reclaim we were told that 2 of our suitcases were stuck in Dubai and 2 days later they haven‚Äôt arrived. There was no compensation the food was bad and the toothbrush was way worse. Don‚Äôt fly with Emirates they are money-hungry monsters and don‚Äôt get a connection flight through Dubai."

On returning we were told we were too much of a risk to fly with them and we‚Äôre escorted off the plane !! We then were told we needed a letter or email from the NHS to say our son was fit to fly which we managed to get but then had to pay again for the flights !

Hundreds of people and only about 3 staff on the desk. Absolute chaos. People fighting, arguing Emirates just did not care. Peoke were fainting because of the length of time gueing.

Flights were cancelled the Tuesday before we were due to fly because of extreme weather, which is understandable, BUT the Wednesday after we were still told to come to the airport, even though no Tuesday passengers had flown. Our flight was rescheduled 6 times, and then eventually cancelled just after midnight. 

We were told to stay at the airport until 9am the following day to maybe get a flight 

NO FOOD, WATER OR ACCOMODEATION was provided at all, and when I asked for a blanket to sleep on the floor I was laughed at. My reason for asking was I have very severe arthritis and my hips are fusing together so sleeping on a marble floor was very painful - this was not respected or taken seriously at all. There was another passenger with Type one Diabetes who was also accused of making diabetes up as the staff did not know what it was 

There has been no information or system in rebooking flights, Customers form Thursday onwards have been checked in, but all of the Tuesday and Wednesday passengers have been TOTALLY ignored and bullied into buying incredibly inflated new tickets 

The airport itself is chaos and a huge health and safety violation. Yesterday there were 35,000 passengers in the airport and only 2 members of staff on the help desk. Everyone received the same information which was totally useless and just sent everyone around in circles. the web chat kicked people out immediately and the phone lines were impossible to access, the ONLY people that managed to get through were those who requested that relatives they have in INDIA call to reshedule their flight 

So far we have had to spend 48 hours on the airport floor with no support, rude mocking staff and have had to fork out more money finding a hotel locally which emirates have expressed no intention to help with at all 

This is the WORST experience I have ever had with any airline, Ryan air was more comfortable and had much kinder and respectful staff 

We still have no idea at all about when our flight will be, according to Emirates they cant do anything because on their system we have already flown, which is absurd 

I understand that the rain was out of their control, but its been over 72 hours since the rain and their organisation and procedure to help guide us through it has been totally appalling 

I would avoid this airline at all costs, all they care about is money"

Arrived at the airport at 12 am on 17th April for a 4:45 am flight. Boarded the plane at 9 am and forced to deplane at 12 noon because the flight was rescheduled. Meager breakfast provided, no lunch. Refunds refused since the flight was rescheduled and not cancelled. 
12 - 3 pm spent time determine next steps with the airline crew in India who were completely powerless to book any flights, given false promises and assurances and told to take the rescheduled flight on 18th April at 6am. Went home at 5 pm and came back at 1 am per airline instructions. Was not even allowed entry into the airport because airline forgot to share the manifest with security. 
Finally allowed entry - wait at the check in counter for 2 hours with only one boarding pass and no assurances on the connecting flight. Board the connecting flight at 7 am and finally depart at 9 am. Arrive in Dubai and try to find a seat on the next outbound plane to JFK. After multiple lines, arguments and abuses ( no food or water mind you), board a plane at 2 pm to leave immediately. Plane waits on the runway for 4 hours and finally deplanes everyone (because crew cannot legally fly and there were minor technical glitches).
Again no meal served. Passengers - adults and kids were provided tiny cracker packets and juice. 
Ground crews were supposed to wait with vouchers and yet no one was available to even answer a question. 

No exaggeration, I am not even sharing all the grisly details of these two days. Natural disasters happen but no flood is excuse for complete and utter chaos like this.

Due to adverse weather conditions, the flight was understandably cancelled. However, the handling of arrangements following this cancellation was deeply disappointing. I was rebooked on a flight 24 hours later and accommodated at the Millennium Airport Hotel Dubai. Regrettably, the hotel's standards were subpar; the room was unclean and the beds were unsanitary, which resulted in a skin rash. Additionally, the quality of the food provided was poor.

The subsequent experience at the airport on April 17, 2023, compounded my frustration. The rescheduled flight was subject to continuous delays, announced at 30-minute intervals, ultimately departing at significantly later than the planned time of 8:20 AM. I was informed that the deferments were due to a lack of ground staff and crew availability. During this prolonged period, we were confined to the gate area from approximately 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM without access to food and water, as we were instructed to dispose of all bottles prior to entry.

The treatment received by passengers during this time was not only inconvenient but also disrespectful. The lack of clear communication and proper facilities during the delay was inconsiderate and unprofessional.

Given these experiences, I am compelled to reconsider my future travel plans with Emirates. I have previously held Emirates in high regard and chosen it over other carriers for its reputed customer service and reliability. However, this incident has significantly impacted my perception of your airline.

I kindly request a formal apology and an explanation for the handling of this situation. Additionally, I believe compensation is due for the discomfort and inconvenience caused. I hope that feedback such as this can be used constructively to improve Emirates' service standards.

0.94478964805603,1.25262260437012,"Emirates Baggage Policy",1,"I am a frequent flyer- travelled to 12 countries with more than 100 international journeys in past 7 years. This is the worst experience I had with any airlines. Reasons for disappointment:
1. In carry on baggage only one 7-kg baggage is allowed by Emirates. All the airlines I travelled in past allowed an additional purse/laptop bag but Emirates refused to allow my laptop bag saying that only 1 bag is allowed and that with laptop bag weight will be more than 7kg. Never in my lifetime, any other airlines refused laptop bag or asked me to check the weight of laptop bag. 
2. Very young and immature staff at the check-in who acts like robots following procedures. They are not considerate, lacking in empathy and just keep repeated the same lines that additional carry on bag (my laptop bag) won't be allowed as the total weight is to be less than 7kg. No senior staff to handle exceptions. I had a grueling time with the staff at the check-in. They pushed me beyond exhaustion and spent 2-3 hours standing aside in the line, waiting for the staff to show some consideration so that I can get my check-in done. Finally they asked me to remove all the additional things from my laptop bag like charging cable, wires, headset etc. to carry only the laptop with me in that otherwise empty bag. I didn't even realize that a laptop weighed 1.5kg until the staff weighed each and every item in my bag separately asking them to be put in check-in baggage. 3hrs was spent arguing and discussing with the staff to carry my 1.5ks laptop with me to the flight- what more do you need to make life terrible for a person who has a 45hr long journey ahead. I cannot understand why such a huge airlines as Emirates care so much about charging for every additional grams taken inside the flight and not ready to let go any penny they could grab from a passenger. It's like you won't leave any opportunity to torture passengers like hell.
3. Convinced that there are no alternatives and that the staff cannot find any solution, I asked the staff to cancel my flight and return the money so that I could travel with another airlines. But they are not equipped to handle that as well. They had no clue how to cancel my ticket and give me a refund. They told me that I have to call the Emirates customer service and ask for a refund.
4. Combination of flights for connecting from India to Canada are not well designed and without proper communication to the passenger on what to expect in the journey with respect to transfers/ self check-in to the next flight etc.
5. The connecting was via Boston with a 15hr layover. You are asked to take all your check-in baggage, leave the Boston airport and do a fresh check-in 2-hours before the journey. However, this self check in process and transfer outside airport is not mentioned in ticket bookings. Even at the time of checking-in at Bangalore airport, the baggage tags are until Toronto and the staff communicated that bags will directly reach Toronto. It was never communicated at the time of ticket booking or check-in that you have to exit Boston airport. 
6. There were many passengers like me who were just directed to leave Boston airport with their bags and asked to come back after 12 hours to another terminal for the connecting flight, who had no place to rest and no clue that this would happen.
7. When the entire itinerary spans a 45hour journey, Emirates gave a terrible time to its passengers. Passengers were not allowed to enter the airport until before 2 hours of the journey from Boston to Toronto and had to sleep/wait in the chilling cold in the outsides of Boston airport which didn't have any places to buy food or drinks.
8. Neither the airlines or airport staff cared about how you manage the 15 hours connecting in the cold, sleeping near the airport entrance doors with no food or drink options.
9. When all people waited for the check-in of the connecting flight from Boston at 5.40am, the connecting flight airlines staff themselves showed up at the check-in counter only at 3.40am. Thereby, restricting all possibilities to enter the insides of the airport before that. The passengers started waiting from 2am itself desperate to enter some warm place but there was no airlines staff to help them.
10. In spit of paying amount for additional weight at Bangalore airport, I had to go through the same experience of weighing the bags, re-adjusting the weights etc. at Boston airport since it's a fresh check-in at Boston. Second round of torture in the early morning when I paid for the additional weight for the entire journey until Toronto and was told that the bags can be collected directly at the Toronto airport.
11. Inflight experience- in the 4hours flight from Bangalore to Dubai, the staff conveniently skipped meals and drinks for some people. While passengers just a row ahead of us had multiple offers for food alternatives and drink options in a 20-30mins time window, we kept waiting for food to be served in our seats. We kept asking the staff if we could have something to eat because we were hungry and it was an 8pm flight just at dinner time. There was a 6th grade child and mother in my adjacent seats and the child was too hungry. After asking the staff for 3rd time also we didn't get any offer for food or drink. Finally after 45mins of asking the same question multiple times, I got infuriated and asked the staff to tell me """"what should we do to get something to eat?"""". Then the staff served food to the child and her mother. It was terrible on flight services. On one hand airlines staff roam around smiling, carrying cameras and asking passengers whether they want their pictures taken. On the other hand they refuse to provide basic services and refuse to cater to requests of passengers, ignores them in even serving water or drinks on repeated requests."

Two of their team particularly impressed me greatly. Julian and Gemma at the airport.

Working as long as I have in service businesses, it's very hard to build a team that are great brand ambassadors. Both of these staff certainly are that for Emirates, as were their cabin staff on flight.

On the morning of our flight we set out a 03.00 for Heathrow for a 09.10 flight we then found that the flight had been delayed and then delayed again. There was total confusion amongst the staff every member saying something different and then about 13.00 hours we were told the flight had been cancelled and we were ordered to go through passport control, collect our luggage and make our own way to Birmingham airport. The only transport available to Birmingham was public transport coach that we had to make our own way and pay ¬£78 for the privilege. The only problem was Emirates had lost one our suit cases which we only got back 4 days later.

The trip to Birmingham took three and a half hours and by that time we had not eaten or slept since around 03.00 that morning. I'm 76 and my wife is 71 and neither of us are in great health so the experience was horrendous. The total delay was 12 hours, instead of flying on a A380 in seats we had chosen for easy access to the toilets we flew on a 777 in seats in the middle of the central row making access to the toilets difficult when passengers either side are asleep.

I travel a lot with work and also do long haul flights regularly from Australia to the UK.

Emirates make it very hard to upgrade or use points within the Skywards program. When you go to upgrade before flights there is never any upgrades available with points as they want you to pay cash. Its absolutely shocking you can never use your points you have gained after spending thousands flying with them. Even at Dubai they want you to pay and cant use points. They just want your money, all to benefit the airline and not you. Its pretty bad. When I last flew back to Sydney, they made me pay ¬£1000 to upgrade to business instead of using points and after boarding the business flight was half empty, I felt very robbed and was no benefit to me.

I will be returning back to Etihad as they make it very easy to upgrade, can use points whenever you want and also can bid on business flight which is amazing.

I had never flown with Emirates before, and I had high expectations based on their reputation. However I can now honestly say it is the worst airline I have ever flown with, and I am quite a well-travelled person. 

On the way to our destination, we had to change at Dubai. Despite the fact it should have been 1 hour 40 minute layover, it was such a stressful change, having to run through the airport and wait ages for a bus to take us to another terminal whilst worrying we were going to miss our flight. We weren't the only ones. We made our flight, but our luggage didn't. Our luggage was delayed by over a day, which was a great start to our holiday!

On the plane itself, you get nothing in Economy - no amenities kit for overnight flights, no ear plugs, nothing. The breakfast food is also absolutely disgusting, such as a super dry chicken sausage, flavourless rubbery omelettes and bizarre choices such as vegetable crepes. I usually don't mind economy class breakfasts but this was awful!

On our way back, our flight was delayed in the Seychelles. First by 2 hours, then another 2 hours, then a total of 14 hours. It was an overnight flight too. We were stuck at the airport gate, not offered any food except the food from the plane. No hotel either and we weren't allowed to leave the airport. Emirates did nothing as it wasn't their airport. They didn't even give us any information about what would happen with our connecting flight, seat reservations etc.

When we got to Dubai, we had a 7 hour layover and a flight at 2am. They offered us a hotel which was nice, but I think lounge access and food vouchers would have been more appropriate given the short amount of time (we had to leave the hotel at midnight), and the food wasn't great at the hotel, it was just a basic buffet.  

We got back to the UK a total of 18 hours later than we should have. We missed the coach we paid for, and couldn't reschedule it beyond 12 hours, so were out of pocket for that. 

We should be receiving 600 euros compensation. We made the claim straight away, and after over a month, they finally responded. They refused to pay for our coach tickets. Instead of actually paying compensation, they tried to give us airmiles. Why they think we would like to fly with Emirates again after that experience, I do not know. We are disputing it but will likely have to wait another 30+ days for a response.

I noticed other passengers didn't eat it either. There was a tiny plastic container of about three spoonfuls of boiled pasta. That, and a tiny piece of cheese was my main meal.

Dear Emirates Customer Service,

I am writing to express my utter dismay and frustration regarding the appalling service I have received from Emirates Airlines. As a loyal customer, I have always held your airline in high regard, but recent events have severely tarnished my perception.

I recently received an email from Emirates offering me the opportunity to upgrade my journey from Dubai to Zurich at a special price. Naturally, I was excited about this offer and immediately clicked on the provided link to take advantage of it. However, to my astonishment and disbelief, I was greeted with a message stating that no more seats were available for the upgrade. This bait-and-switch tactic is not only deceptive but also highly unprofessional.

To add insult to injury, I had previously arranged for an auto upgrade using my hard-earned miles, only to discover that Emirates had unilaterally canceled this arrangement without any notification or explanation. This level of disregard for customer loyalty is completely unacceptable.

It is evident that Emirates Airlines lacks integrity and fails to prioritize the satisfaction of its customers. Your actions have not only inconvenienced me but have also eroded my trust in your airline. As a result, I am seriously reconsidering my future travel plans with Emirates and will not hesitate to share my negative experience with others.

I demand a prompt explanation for this gross mishandling of my booking and a suitable resolution to rectify the situation. Anything less would only further confirm my decision to seek alternative airline options in the future.

Yours sincerely"

We are traveling to Dubai for the first time on our 11th anniversary. I called customer service six times before I booked and looked through the website multiple times before I booked our flight. Through the conversations with the reps and reading through the website, I was told I could use miles to upgrade my seats. I was also told how many points I needed to upgrade my seats. So I opened the Emirates card to get 60k miles, joined the Skyward program to get 10k miles and other benefits, transferred miles from other points programs, and purchased additional miles from Skyward.
I bought the ticket in March, and now I am being told (April) that """"the upgrade with miles is never guaranteed. It completely depends on the flight statistics."""" None of the previous reps mentioned this, nor is it visible on the website. Had I been told this, I would have never purchased all this and taken those steps to get miles. I was scammed. All I want is to use my miles as I was told I would be able to. I have never had a miles program that does not allow you to use the points immediately. I have had Jetblue for years and never had an issue using points. I thought this airline was supposed to be upscale, so I didn't expect it to be a scam. So disappointed. So, the last rep I spoke to told me that there was nothing anyone could do and that I could only submit a complaint. That is sad. HOPEFULLY, THIS HELPS OTHER NOT GET SCAMMED LIKE ME. IF IT'S LIKE THIS BEFORE THE FLIGHT, I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT IT WILL BE LIKE FOR THE FLIGHT."

2.0995557308197,4.21891212463379,"Emirates Flight Delays",2,"We travelled a party of 2 from Dublin to Dubai in march 2024. This leg of the journey went without any problems and made a fantastic start to a fantastic holiday where there was no need to complain about anything it was a 5 *  holiday. The outbound flight was the same as any other flight / airline we had used before, but if I had a choice I would say Aerlingas long haul is better. There was nothing outstanding and nothing to complain about. 

Come to travelling home from Dubai to Dublin. It got off to a bad start because we had arrived at terminal 2 when we should have been at terminal 3 of course this was my mistake and because we left our hotel hours before our flight it really was not an issue. The problem we had was another 15 minute journey in a taxi to terminal 3. 

2 taxi s later we were at the correct terminal and we were told to go to the self service it would be quicker. While in the self service it was obvious the check in desks were a lot quicker but never mind we got checked in with self service easlily enough. 

The airport is huge and you need to get a train/monorail to your gate area s, all went smoothly with this and we managed to be in the correct area for our gates. 

We decided to get Mcdonalds as they have a far better menu than we do in Ireland. We were receiving messages on our phones stating gate opened at 13-50 and closes at 14-15. We still had time before the gate opened so started to head towards the gate and take a bathroom stop. My daughter started to feel unwell and needed to use the bathroom again. I was rushing along and checking the time we still had 15 minutes before the gate closed so we started to walk to the gate it was quite a long walk but 10 minutes before the gate closed we approached it. One of the boarding staff started shouting across the airport GATE IS CLOSING. I was a bit suprised because i had clearly been receiving messages stating 14.15 and it was 9 minutes before this time. I had the phone in my hand and when we passed over our tickets and passports to board I did say I didnt think we were late Ive been receiving messages and we still have 8 minutes before the gate closes. The female staff who was taking the tickets and passports said  """"well do you want to take the 8 minutes,"""" but not even in a joking light hearted manner just in pure disgust and looking across to other staff rolling her eyes. I replied with """"no we are here now"""". When we went through the doors to board the plane there was noone directing you where to go which was also strange. So I turned around and ask where do we need to go. The same female worker who took the passports SHOUTED """"DOWN"""". I found this to be very RUDE and I have travelled with all different airlines including budget Ryanir and Jet Blue and I have never come across airline staff speaking to customers so vile. I do beleive I am not a dog been told to get down while jumping up. The staff at the boarding gate compared to 10 days travel to Dubai and being on holiday let the whole experience down.
Id only said it that morning to my daughter, travelling home was still part of the holiday and experience and to make the most of it. Well you could say the holiday was well and truely over at this stage. We walked down the tunnel to board the flight and people were still in the tunnel it took a futher 12 minutes to get to our seats and seated due to the queue, so Im wondering why the rush at the boarding gate. 

We had paid an extra ‚Ç¨100 to sit at the back of the plane in the 2 seats so I was near a window and my daughter wasnt in the middle seat and someone at the side of her. When we got seated my daughter realised her seat was broken, it would not stay in place when she sat back it reclined and sat forward it bounced back. When everyone was seated we asked the flight attendant about it and asked could we take the 2 seats at the other side which were free and he said they are reserved for staff and he would look at it once we took off and seat belt signs turned off. Im not sure the seat was safe for take off if there was any incident during take off. 

Once the flight had took off and the seat belt signs turned off the male cabin staff came to try and fix the seat he said normally if you just do this and this it will reset the seat but he was unable to fix it. 

Is anyone reporting these seats as faulty from the previous flight because it was faulty when we arrived at our seats, Its very bad when you charge for seats that are broken. Once he had finished trying to fix it the seat was actually worse because it was now sticking into my daughters back at the bottom. He did go off to find alternative seats which were in the middle Isle and not seat for seat not even the window which is why I paid for my seats. My daughter wasnt feeling well so she didnt want to move on  her own neither did she want to move to be in the middle of the middle seats so she just tried to go to sleep and not move in the seat. Its still not acceotable when the seat could have been fixed before we boarded. Or given alternative seats at check in. Id previously seen the people who were sitting in the vacant seats be moved to the seats in front so there must have also been an issue with those seats as well. That was the hold up getting seated when boarding.

The food was lovely (dairy free) travelling from Dublin to Dubai I managed to eat everything from the 2 meals provided but I was unable to eat anything on the return flight from Dubai apart from a piece of fish. I couldnt even say what the food was on the return journey it was inedible for anyone travelling to Dublin and while I understand the food is different from Ireland than what is made in Dubai I cant even say it resembelled quisine from Dubai.

We flew economy and paid extra for the 2 seat plan. We found the seats very narrow and felt really squashed in. The flight attendants did not seem well trained, they either seemed to be very unapproachable and distant, or inappropriately engaging in small talk with one or 2 passengers during busy periods like meal service, leaving the rest of the customers waiting unduly for food service, but not seemin to notice or care.

The meals themselves were fine, however you were presented with a very overloaded tray including snacks (usually on long haul these are served at different times across the journey), it was off-putting and made it uncomfortable as there was nowhere to put the snacks as you jostled for elbow space to even eat the meal due to how narrow the spaces are.
It gave a feeling of a real lack of customer care, shoving everything at you at once then walking off. They do provide proper cutlery and that‚Äôs nice, and the food itself is of decent quality and there‚Äôs certainly enough of it.

Trying to get the flight attendant‚Äôs attention was difficult, and they even ignored me on more than one occasion when they came to collect rubbish - I ended up twice taking my rubbish directly to them, which shouldn‚Äôt really happen.

The bathroom facilities are good, the inflight entertainment is ok (although I started watching a film on one flight to find it wasn‚Äôt available on the connecting one even though same model plane), the headphones are incredibly poor quality, but I couldn‚Äôt seem to get the Bluetooth to work.
Overall it gave the impression of a shove them in shove them out experience more expected on a short haul budget flight. One of our planes was nicer, it was a bigger airbus 800 (I think?), but the service and style was still poor compared to say, Virgin Atlantic.

1. Flight times from Newcastle remain terrible, arriving in Dubai at just after midnight - losing the first day of a holiday. It‚Äôs just as bad on the return journey from Dubai to Newcastle, leaving Dubai at 0720. The flight times need to improve. 
2. On Newcastle to Dubai flights many passengers immediately queue around the service areas requesting drinks almost from take off and are indulged by staff. Some people manage to drink alcohol during the entire flight. This delays the inflight service - for people remaining in their seats and not trying to grab as much as they can, it takes longer than it should do to get a drink and the service of the food is delayed, as staff are preoccupied with serving the ‚Äúguzzlers‚Äù, who, in my view, should be discouraged. 
3. Food quality has deteriorated. On Newcastle to Dubai flights you get lunch, which is ok, and a snack, which used to be a pastry or sandwich. This time the ‚Äúsnack‚Äù was a tub of ( unpleasant ) ice cream or a bag of popcorn. Disappointing.

We did wait over 10 minutes in front of the 2 Toilets as they said occupied, in this thime 2 flight attended did pass us just looking at us. But then a third Attendend came by and  I did ask if this peaple fell a sleep in the toilet.

I did point out to her that other passenger in the back of the plae were walking around freely and using the toilets, that made her more upset.

It was my wife and I wedding anniversary on the day of travel. We had booked an economy flight and when we got to Dubai airport, we tried to upgrade to business class but no luck. Being Gold members we were able to board the flight early with the first and business class passengers. While on board we asked one of the hostesses about upgrading but could not. We told the hostess it was our wedding anniversary and was hoping to get the upgrade. Even though we could not get the upgrade, the hostess assured us that even though we were in economy class, she would make sure we were taken care of.

And did she really take care of us. The hostess, Liza from Estonia, was extremely nice. She went out of her way the entire flight to ensure we were comfortable, any request we had, she made sure she personally took care of it. She would check on us regularly to see if we needed anything. Even though we were flying economy class, we were being treated as first class passengers. It made the flight less stressful. She and the other crew members were friendly and very personable. We really had a wonderful anniversary on that flight and want to say a big ‚ÄúTHANK YOU,‚Äù to Liza from Estonia. You are the best. Appreciate you very much. Wish there were other ways we could show our appreciation. Hope to catch you on another Emirates flight in the near future.

I went ahead and purchased a new ticket, also paying for additional luggage to match my original ticket allocation. Then it got worse! 
Whilst in Pakistan i contacted Emirates Karachi to make sure my first ticket was cancelled, and ensure that my connecting flight from Dubai to Stansted remained in tact. They said i needn't have a bought new as the first ticket could be changed with an additional cost. in fact they said i had to do this to keep the Dubai to Stansted ticket.

This agent did not issue boarding passes, he asked us to remove things inside to make them 21kg in total, and come back to get boarding passes. We went out the airport to where our relatives were waiting to give them things we have to remove. 

When we returned to the counter the agent did not reweight our bags; he just said: """"next time don't bring over weight"""" and gave us the boarding passes. I asked if our bags will be checked-in like what happened when we departed in Montreal? He answered """"no"""", so we have to carry them on. 

It took 1.5 hours to pass the carried-on bags issue, but it did not finish yet!
    
After we passed the boarding gate, the Emirates people ask us to weight our bags again!  This time they found our 3 bags still over weight.

We were ready to take out more things but this time we don't have our relatives with us. We had no other choice!

I asked how much I have to pay for the over weight? One Emirates guy said $250, I said OK, I will pay. 

That  guy then went to talk with his group and returned with paper and pen. He started talking that our over weight is two """"pit"""", each """"pit"""" cost $250, so I have to pay $500! I was stunned! I asked how many kilo for one pit? This Emirates guy did not answer, he kept talking about over weight and """"pit"""". My wife got angry and asked the guy why he said $250 a moment ago and now said $500? To my stun, this guy said he would not talk to my wife because she is angry! 

Then an Emirates woman showed up, she warned us that the plane will depart in 25 minutes and if we are not on board we simply miss the flight! 

I was getting more upset and kept asking how many kilos for a """"pit""""? But still no answer! Then another Emirates guy showed up and told me he will handle this case.

In Dhaka airport, I paid 22,000 taka (USD 200) for an extra piece of luggage and did an all-through check-in for the luggage to be delivered directly to Conakry. 

On January 28, when I arrived at Dubai airport for check-in for my flight to Conakry, the check-in counter claimed that the payment for an extra piece of luggage was pending, and I cannot check-in if I don't pay an additional 780 dirham (USD 200). I said I had already paid for the luggage in the originating airport in Dhaka. However, the counter staff said the payment was up to Dubai, not Conakry. I showed them the tag, mentioning that it would go to Conakry. The check-in staff and supervisor sent me to the ticketing counter on the other side of the airport, who again sent me to the check-in counter, and then the check-in counter sent me to another check-in counter on another side. 

The person in charge said, ‚ÄúYou must pay the additional amount, or I will offload you from the flight.‚Äù I asked him to contact the Dhaka office because I made the payment in Dhaka and I have the receipt. I said, ‚ÄúI am going to Conakry, and my luggage is with you. I did not task Dhaka Emirates staff to check the luggage up to Dubai. I don‚Äôt know why you gave me a tag confirming that my luggage was going to Conakry, and now you are demanding additional money.‚Äù The person contacted Dhaka and then said the Dhaka office asked you to pay. I said, it is unfair to pay double the amount. 

Meanwhile, I was running late to catch the flight. Therefore, I agreed to pay. When I was about to pay and was providing my pin code on the POS machine, the person in charge from behind said, """"Don't pay!"""" and removed the card from the POS machine. Finally, he said, the Dhaka office made an error. The passenger should pay the luggage charge at the originating airport for the entire flight, not just for one segment. 

Due to this delay, I was about to miss my flight. A person at the Emirates cash counter helped me pass through the security line, which is why I was able to catch the flight. Although I managed to catch the flight, it was one of my worst experiences with Emirates. Before the flight, I ran from the counter to the counter, seeking help for the fault I had not made. I had to suffer mentally and went through stress before my long flight to Conakry. Even before boarding the flight at the final security, Emirates staff separated me for extra screening and for confirmation whether I paid the so-called pending amount. 

I always rated Emirates highly, but my last flight brought me one of the worst flight experiences. After reaching Conakry, I lodged a complaint (DXB/X/050224/7994048) on Emirates website to make the officials accountable for what they did so that passengers do not suffer for the mistakes committed by their staff.

To begin with, I flew out on the 1st March from T3 and got to the airport at 6.45am as the flight was at 9.10am. I provided my ticket to the staff near the self service check in counter and they started saying that my ticket doesn't match the name on my passport so this may be an issue. I must state that I flew with Emirates 18 months ago with the same name and there were no issues then.

During this time, I met a woman called Eona / Iona, who was seriously wasting my time and completely useless. She asked me to get the name changed through my relative who works in Emirates in Dubai but their system was down that morning and it couldn't be changed in time. She insisted that if it could not be done before check in, I would have to purchase a ticket for a new flight.

She then disappeared when I was trying to get hold of her as my relative from Emirates in Dubai wanted to speak to her over the phone. What was extremely disrespectful about her was that when we eventually found her, she rudely ignored me and just palmed us on to other staff to take over the situation while she was brown nosing some customers using business class. An absolute coconut! I would love to wipe the smug look on her face! 

I also met this idiot called George who made up rubbish about Emirates incurring a fine if they issued me a ticket when honestly nothing would've happened. This was a clever ploy to milk more money out of me through a new ticket. Just to add, there were no issues on the way back from Dubai to London on 9th March with the names on the ticket, which just strengthens my point.

However, there were two other flights before the one they selected in which Emirates could have moved all or part of us; indeed, after some discussions with the connection desk we were further moved to the flight immediately after the one we lost (even though we had to wait 7 hours in the Dubai airport) but we had to fight for it and we were asked to give evidence of certain health problems which are quite private. Lastly, as compensation for all these troubles Emirates gave us the possibility to have a free meal in one of the venues operated by it; we went to Mc Donald‚Äôs to find out that we were not even allowed to choose our meal among the entire menu but only a pre-selected meal decided by Emirates.

1) Seating Arrangements : I had prebooked the ticket for my mother in the same flight as mine and paid extra to get the seats right behind me. I was told that the row behind me cant be given to me as the seats were for the baby basinet and hence was given tickets the row after. In the flight the seats behind my business class rows were available and when I tried to move there the rude and threatening employee ( so called supervisor or so he claimed) came and said I cant sit there and I have to pay an additional $230 for the seat. I had already paid more than $200 for reserving the seats and I had explicitly requested for the seats behind business class seat and that time I was denied on the grounds that the seats are only for presents traveling with babies and once on board. I had paid close to $10000 on the trip - do you think when I prebooked the flights I would have refused to pay an additional $30. The staff were selling the seats for $230.  Not only I was denied to sit on those seats the passengers who were on the seats didnt have babies were using all 3 and 4 seats respectively in their rows when they only paid for one. The airlines staff rather than being considerate for my old ailing mother sided with those people who were mis using the seats. The staff was only rude to me in spite of me paying for the business class ticket and my ailing mother but they sided with the passengers. The only reason I could see is that the passengers sitted on those seats were of different skin tones than me and I had paid more for my seats than them.

Its so difficult to reach the airport on time in Mumbai's traffic and the Emirates staff was so arrogant that they didn't even bother to inform me that they had screwed up on the car service. I almost missed my flight. I had to pay 4800 Rupees in Mumbai to get to the airport to the hotel car..

The business class cabin in the B777 does not live up to the label or the price tag - if it was not work paying for the trip, I would feel totally ripped off. The 2-3-2 layout leaves a lot to be desired, and the lack of space generally is a real sore spot when compared to business class on the A380. Business class on a an A380 is luxury, as it should be.

My wife and I booked with this airline to return from London to Columbo on our return we experienced a no-show with a taxi after booking a day in advance which meant we had to book another taxi on the day of return for which we had a waiting time of approx 2 hours which coincided with rush hour, unfortunately, we missed our flight from columbo to Dubai as we had a five-hour wait in Dubai it gave us an option of a flight with Sri Lankan airlines to Dubai giving us  plenty of time to catch our connecting flight with emirates which we had paid for on arrival at Dubai when checking in they could not find our booking and we, where asked to go to the ticket office where we meet this arrogant young man who informed us our flight, had been suspended in his words because we could not catch the first part of our return journey we had already spent ¬£400 on the flight with Sri Lankan airlines  we explained what had happened re the taxi but he was not sympathetic in any way and insisted we had to pay another ¬£1600 again to fly back to london on the same flight as we had already paid for and almost the same seats BEWEAR OF THIS ARLINE AS THIS IS THE SECOND TIME WE HAVE HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE"

Booked the connecting flights with Emirates after reading reviews and coming to the conclusion that connections through Dubai are generally easy and well managed by Emirates.  Turned out not to be the case for us (I strongly believe now we should have flown direct with Sri Lankan Air).   Arrival into Dubai was delayed 30 minutes as we circled Dubai for exactly that long due to heavy air traffic.  Feeling under pressure due to the late arrival, we rushed at the flight board and headed off to the wrong terminal by bus.  Yes, this was a mistake on our part.  Yet, it should be mentioned that no terminal information was printed on boarding pass in London.  We understand that gate assignment is difficult to predict, but terminal info elsewhere, in our experience, is not.  Additionally, bus connection between terminals was painfully slow in Dubai.  It took precisely 40 minutes for us to make it terminal F with the bus travelling at roughly at 10 km/hr stuck beyond vehicles moving luggage.  The ride was agonizing and I cannot recommend this airport to anyone, at least the way it operated as we observed it.  Regardless, with the mistake on our part and the slow bus ride there was no chance at all of making our connection.  Our experience at the service desk was equally negative, with the clerk insisting that our flight did in fact arrive on time (‚Äúit is recorded‚Äù he repeated) when it most certainly did not.  So we paid out of pocket for the next flight out which included a stop in Male and received wrong information about whether to get off the plane during the stop.  We made it okay regardless, after the need to stay in the plane was made clear during the flight.  To sum, I cannot imagine trying to connect in Dubai on Emirates ever again.  And I do not recommend that anyone else attempt this should there be other options.  The only saving grace of the entire experience is that there are many designated smoking areas in DBX, much appreciated when trying to deal with the stress of connecting here with Emirates."

1.56392514705658,4.35120296478271,"Emirates Flight Delays",1,"On February 23, 2024, my family of 4 had a booked and confirmed return flight on the BKK-DXB (EK377) and then DXB-WAW (EK179) route. The journey, which was supposed to last 15 hours 20 minutes and end on February 23 at 11:20 a.m., ended on February 25 at 3 p.m., more than 51 hours later than expected! Flight EK377 was to be delayed, initially at 0:46, 23/02/2024, we received information by e-mail that the departure from BKK will take place at 5.00. At the Bangkok airport, the Emirates crew treated passengers disrespectfully, even at 4:30 they said that the flight would depart at 5:00, even though there was no boarding.It was only around 6 a.m., after a whole night at the airport, that the flight was canceled. We were informed that we would be transferred to the hotel. There was a huge mess while waiting for transport, there was misinformation: where/whom to go to, where to pick up the luggage. We had to wait until 8 a.m. (being one of the first in the queue) for the buses that were to take us to the hotel, where we arrived only before 10 a.m. Then, at 3 p.m., we were taken to the airport, where we were again forced to go through all the procedures related to check-in and a long wait. for flight EK8377. This flight was also delayed, this time due to the late arrival of the cabin crew. The sight of a stewardess running to the plane 20 minutes before its scheduled departure is unacceptable, especially in premium airlines, such as Emirates.After reaching Dubai, we had to wait a long time to receive registration cards and transfer to the hotel. At the Emirates information desk, we expressed our concerns about the short connection time in Ljubljana (50 minutes). We saw that there were free seats in the business class on the direct connection to Warsaw, but the lady informed us that we were not entitled to an upgrade. Emirates had no problem significantly reducing the comfort and class of travel by adding one more transfer and changing carriers to FlyDubai and LOT Polish Airlines, but taking care of the passenger within its own airline was out of the question. We were assured that there were no concerns about our connection, that it was the best option for us, and if the flight from Dubai was delayed, we could count on Emirates' help. Blinded by promises, we went to the hotel, where we did not have our most necessary things with us, as they were in checked luggage.
Unfortunately it was not the end of our odyssey. We had to fly fly from DBX to Ljubljana (Slovenia) on FlyDubai budget airlines - nightmare
Our flight was operated by FlyDubai. It was not our will, but Emirates's, which changed our reservations to a budget carrier. After arriving at the airport, at the gate, we informed the staff that according to the schedule we had only 50 minutes to transfer to the flight to WAW and asked the crew of the flight to WAW to be informed about the large group of people transferring to the flight to WAW. We were informed that our request would be fulfilled and we had no reason to worry as we would arrive in Ljubljana on time. Unfortunately, instead of the scheduled take-off at 12:45, the plane took off only at 14:01 and arrived at LJU at 16:49, as a result of which we were not allowed to board the next flight to WAW. At LJU airport we tried to get help through the EMIRATES hotline, which turned out to be absolutely unhelpful. If it weren't for the determination of LJU Airport employees who were not employed by Emirates, I don't know how long our trip would have lasted. The Emirates hotline showed sluggishness and a lack of basic empathy for passengers who had been traveling for over 42 hours! Due to Emirates' lack of cooperation with both passengers and Ljubljana airport employees, we left the airport only after 9 p.m., as it took that long to arrange a connection back to the country. Moreover, the FlyDubai carrier did not provide the standard during the flight that I expected when purchasing a flight with Emirates. This concerned the comfort of travel, the selection of seats, we traveled in a group of 4 people, where it was important for us to be next to each other. All services on board had an additional fee. You had to pay for every drink and even to use the entertainment on the monitor. The meal also fell significantly short of Emirates standards.

It's been a week since I submitted my complaint. The complaint was registered and... nothing. Total lack of interest from Emirates Airlines. Absolute disregard for the passenger. I understand that delays and cancellations happen, but the quality of a company is reflected in how it can cope with problems. OK, they awarded extra miles, but I don't care anymore. I will never use Emirates services again. The whole situation cost me too much nerves and the need to postpone important meetings. Never again. Emirates is certainly not a premium airline"

That being said, no matter what sexual orientation one is, there should be no tolerance against discrimination. 

I am aware that the flight attendants cannot help with luggage but we had absolutely no assistance in at least holding the babies while getting our luggage in the overhead. This happened on all of our flights. 

There is a particular flight attendant on the second flight to Cape Town with blonde hair who made our trip very uncomfortable. She was calling her co-worker laughing and discussing us over the phone and in the kitchen and  gave us dirty looks for the entire flight. I unfortunately didn't get her name but surely that is not acceptable and I would like to report her. 

Emirates lost my pram which caused a huge amount of stress when arriving in London. I was not able to get through customs because I had no capacticy to carry 2 screaming babies and all my luggage so I basically sat in the middle of the airport crying my eyes out because I did not know what to do. Even after begging for help, not one person from emirates(ground staff) would assist. No one took responsibility for losing my pram and causing such a huge inconvenience. Eventually I was told that they found my pram, which was left in Dubai and I should wait another 4 hours until it gets delivered. Of which I responded absolutely not. By this time we had been travelling over 19 hours and were extremely exhausted. 

The bassinets provided were disgusting. Not even my dog would sleep in that. 

Overall this was the most awful, stressful experience of my life. My mental health has been affected immensely and I now have no courage to ever fly with my family again. I have had to go to the doctor for a prescription for depression and anxiety medication because of the trauma I have been caused by this."

As a frequent flyer, I understand the unpredictability of air travel, but certain aspects of this journey require attention.

Firstly, the presence of crying children can be an inevitable part of flying, but when seated next to two infants for an extended flight, the disturbance is considerable. While I recognize the limitations of the cabin crew's influence over children's behavior, the lack of intervention or alternative solutions was disappointing.

Moreover, an incident involving hot coffee being accidentally spilled on me was met with a mere apology, with no first aid or proper assistance offered. I was surprised to learn that such an incident wasn't even reported by the cabin crew, as per the airline's response.

The response from Emirates' Customer Affairs was equally disheartening. An automated-sounding reply with no acknowledgement of the coffee incident nor any offer of compensation does not align with the high standards that Emirates purports to uphold.

My return journey compounded my dissatisfaction, with multiple wheelchair-bound passengers, including my mother, being placed in an over-capacity compartment. The attached photo attests to this unsafe practice.

This experience has unfortunately left me dreading future flights with Emirates. The service did not match the premium we paid for our tickets, and the response to our complaints has been lackluster. I am hopeful for improvement and will reconsider my stance based on my future experiences with Emirates."

Although the crew were very friendly, service was lacking.  Only one drinks service offered with the meal then tea or coffee.  One cup or the tiniest can of pop. Next drinks service several hours later for breakfast with tea, coffee or juice.   You could go up for water in between if you wanted.  The food was not nice at all, it most of it was left, poor cuts of meat.  Take your own food and drinks on. 

There is a good selection of movies.  We were sat on the plane for 2 hours delayed before taking off, which already added to a long flight, was not good at all.  At the airport once you have scanned your passport and boarding pass, they make you do it all over again when going to the Emirates gate! And additional security check. 

I have had better service on TUI premium and Virgin Atlantic, where at least in Premium, Virgin offer unlimited snacks and plenty of drinks (I don't know about economy).  On this occasion we didn't have the opportunity to upgrade though.

We booked and I looked forward to something better than the last long haul flights we had had with BA where the food had been pretty disappointing. I was therefore rather taken aback on our outgoing flight, first leg. Expecting the usual drinks and snacks to be issued shortly after take-off, we had not eaten - something we would regret greatly. 2 1/2 hours after take off, we were given our meals. The distribution of these was also rather confusing as passengers in our row but on the other side of the plane received theirs at least an hour or so before us and had finished before we could eat. We were hungry and thirsty. The meal was not great. My partner was surprised, based on his experiences of Emirates in the past. He asked for 2 drinks and was told no. However, the lady in the row in front of us was given the 2 she requested - from the conversation we overheard between her and the stewardess, they were friends. The same lack of organisation in the distribution of meals was repeated with the breakfast - again disappointing food. Hoping this was a one-off, we boarded our 2nd leg of the journey. Seated on the right side of the plane this time, we received our food some 1 1/2 hours before those on the left. We have not experienced this poor organisation with the meal service on any other airline. Our return flights a few weeks later differed a little. The food on the HCM to Dubai was very poor indeed but better on the second leg back to LHR. The staff varied - the male attendant was friendly and served with some humour and desire to please whereas the female attendant in our section never smiled and seemed to resent her job. We agreed with a fellow passenger and the attendant to move seats so that his family could sit together. On waiting for the aisles to clear enough to be able to move, we were suddenly given half a plastic cup of water (to share) as a gesture of thanks for doing this. This was so bizarre, we had to laugh. The seats, toilets and entertainment were fine. I had heard so many good things about Emirates but in summary, I was disappointed and would not fly with them again. I had hoped to write a very different review but it has to be an honest one!"

1. I had a very bad first leg; leaving Jeddah at 20:20 and arriving  at Dubai after midnight. My Dubai layover was 8 hours. I wanted to fly earlier, and spend more time in Dubai, rest in a hotel. My ticket was fully flexible, and when I checked online, I saw that they had available """"flexible"""" and """"fully flexible"""" tickets (though no saver class tickets were available). I used the chat function in the Emirates website to try to change the tickets, The agent said there wasn't any tickets. When I pointed out the web results, he rudely said """"no tickets mean I can't change"""". So, I was unable to change my ticket. 
2. The next day, having nothing to do in Jeddah, I went to the airport at noon time, hoping to relax at the lounge until the flight. However, there were no Emirates agents to help, and I was told that the check-in counters would open up only 4 hours before the flight. So I tried, and was able to check in online. However, the website didn't issue me a boarding pass, saying that I needed to get them from the ticketing counter. So, I ended up waiting in the uncomfortable seats at the terminal for 6 hours. They really should find a solution to let me get inside and use the lounge.

But our connecting flight was then also late - and with some Linford Christie speed we managed to catch it.

Initially, I was enticed to book directly due to a promised price match that was never honored, to absolute chaos whilst trying to board, to a 2.5 hour wait time for food and drinks, along with a 40-minute delay leaving the plane at our connecting flight, leaving us with less than 10 minutes to make our connection, with no assistance provided by the airline staff.

Boarding the plane, both in Manchester, Dubai, and Manilla: they divide the queues into different zones, which in theory is a great idea, but poorly executed due to signs for each zone being right at the front of each queue at chest level; hence until you're almost at the front, you have no idea what's happening from behind. 

The flight from Manchester to Dubai, and coming back from Dubai to Manchester on their A380 (2 floors) - staff are incredibly friendly and genuinely trying their best, but ridiculously understaffed. 2-hour wait for food/drinks on the outward flight.  Return flight  2.5 hours: not acceptable.

On arrival in Dubai, we landed late, with a further wait on the tarmac for a parking bay.  Resulting in an overall 40-minute delay; leaving less than 15 minutes to connect to the next Emirates flight at the other side of Dubai airport. Again, poor service given there was nobody to help us get to the next gate despite a less than 15-minute gap. Luckily, I'm a fast runner, and the connecting Emirates flight was also delayed. 

Based on this experience, which ranks as one of my worst in over 50 international flights, I would not recommend flying with them again.  Recommendations for anyone who must book with them: book via a 3rd party site: it's cheaper. Avoid flying their A380 at all costs, but if you have no option, make sure to book a seat situated middle of the plane where food and drinks are initially served - avoid the very front or back unless you're okay waiting +2 hours for food/drink service."

As my father is sick and they were new to air travel, I also booked wheelchair assistance for them. One day before the travel date, I contacted Emirates customer care, and they informed me that wheelchair assistance could only be provided if it was available at the airport on the travel date. Unfortunately, this information was not communicated to me at the time of booking.
My parents began their journey from COK, but they did not receive any assistance from Emirates employees. In such cases, I expected that some staff members would be able to assist them. Upon reaching DXB, they finally received wheelchair assistance, but here's where the problem occurred. My parents needed to travel to Hamburg from Dubai, but the Emirates staff dropped them off at the Singapore Airlines gate. Fortunately, they overheard other passengers mentioning the country name and checked the monitor to discover the error. Since my parents are not fluent in English, I had booked wheelchair assistance for them. Eventually, they found an airport staff member, who happened to be a sweeper, and he helped them find the correct gate.
Upon reaching Hamburg airport, there was no wheelchair assistance available. If Emirates cannot arrange proper wheelchair service, they should clearly mention this during the booking process. This experience has left me disappointed, and I cannot trust Emirates for wheelchair assistance in the future."

I have been unfortunately scammed by emirates when cancelling my reservation with my ticket and my 2 year old daughter ticket. I called Emirates to cancel and was directed to fill their form. As anticipated by them, my lack of experience using their form, I fell right into their trap, and when I thought I was cancelling the entire reservation, Lo and behold, I missed the tiny + sign to add a second ticket # for my 2 year old. Emirates ran with that and did not cancel my 2 year old ticket at the same time as my ticket. Someone please explain how is this allowed to leave a 2 year old ticket active without the adult companion ??? When I inquired about it I received a response ( 1 week after cancellation), I was told that since I requested the cancellation for her ticket later, they would apply the ticket cancellation terms based on a cancellation request made 1 week after purchase. This is daylight robbery and a nightmarish customer service.

I understand these things happen from time to time but my concern is that we have now gone from waiting 4 hours at Dubai Airport to catch our flight back to London Gatwick to 10.5 hours waiting at Dubai Airport. 

Not only that, but we also must wait until 2.45am to fly and have now lost ¬Ω a day of our holiday.

I have received three responses from their Customer Service Team (Customer Service Team - That‚Äôs a laugh) by Live Chat and by email, the guy on Live Chat (I have screenshot the chat) could not wait to disconnect me and they are just not interested in listening to our concerns.

As you can imagine, this is hugely inconvenient for us as a family and at the very least, Emirates should be looking at compensating us not only for this significant inconvenience, but for the extra cost I will incur for additional food and drink at the airport due to this extended stay at Dubai Airport notwithstanding the cost of losing half a day of our holiday due to this change.

We were later informed by the flydubai manager that email has been sent to the airlines to print a new ticket and send us via email for which i have waited but no luck. I am pregnant and have my check ups scheduled in dubai and in this condition your staff has given me stress and they were unable to understand the situation. The lack of helpful staff members only added to our confusion and frustration which caused us to miss the flight. This could have been easily avoided had the staff shown the care and diligence that is expected of professionals representing your airline. In light of this situation, I also request suitable compensation for the financial losses we incurred as a result of missing our flight.

Yes, if you are lucky enough to get a 787 Dreamliner or a 380-800, at least you are flying in style. But it's their attitude, arrogance and just their utter lack of empathy and customer service that gets me... every single time. 
 
Firstly, they still have the ancient Boeing 777 300's in their fleet. When sitting on the seat I could literacy feel the springs underneath me and the upholstery and fittings have this ancient 1970s twang to it. And just when I thought """"Why on earth are you still flying these dinosaurs?"""", the captain announced that the flight had been delayed because of a leak on one of the wings. You don't say, that is what happens if you fly a plane that is 20 years old!

But they are clever, they know they don't have much competition on the Dubai to Cape Town routes, so it's ok to treat those customers like garbage, they don't have a choice. So let's give our good planes to the busy routes, and totally neglect the ones where we can do just what we want. 

Not only was the plane falling apart cosmetically, our flight was delayed by 5 hours, which is fine, life happens. The bad part is that they did not say """"We are exceptionally sorry"""" but rather """"The flight has been delayed to (+5hours), you will board at gate B22, thank you for your cooperation."""" 
Thank you for my cooperation. Are you serious?  

They then proceed to say """"Economy class passengers can go to a restaurant and get a meal."""" What restaurants? How does it work?  And dare you ask one of the cabin crew, then they seem too busy with life to care. Not where, not that it is a limited menu. Nada. Again, don't mind if it is, but don't treat your customers like elementary school children, having to walk around and figure out themselves where the """"we stuffed up"""" voucher is eligible. When asking the cabin crew, they also do not know, not even the SFS. Lack of training, lack of empathy.

The quality of the service you get is not necessarily measured when things go well, but when things go pear-shaped.

He spent an hour filling the details online and faced the exact same issue after clicking submit. That clearly shows there is sth wrong with system. But I had to prove it ; otherwise no matter how many hours I spent on that online form and sent emails to AHL-Tracing and calling baggage department, no one was supporting on the call. The call center is just like broken records, all they said repeating the same thing """"sorry for inconvenient, we are checking and will get back to you when we get news"""". In fact, there is no actual action, service or support from them which is poor customer service  and extremely frustrating experience for me. Eventually, the staff had to send the inventory details of baggage manually through spreadsheet which I prepared already. 
After spending more than 2 hours at airport, they were checking some luggages with similarity and after seeing my inventory detail, they could locate my luggage at Amsterdam. Then luggage was delivered on 7th Dec.
I am resident in Dubai and silver member of Emirates airline.
This was very difficult and stressful situation for me not having my luggage for almost a week specially my laptop and with overall disappointing customer service which I never expected from Emirates being one of the premium airline globally, I requested for compensation considering not having my luggage for 6 days and going through such a mess, frustration and stress with poor customer service. I received auto reply on my complaint that they would get back to me in 30 days. After several follow ups, they sent an email after more than  one and a half months that they won't give any compensation just because I live in Dubai."

0.566989839076996,4.53065347671509,"Emirates Flight Delays",1,"First experience flying the highly praised expensive Emirates. Complete disaster. If I can help it, will never fly them again.
I had booked a tour of New Zealand and, not having arrived when supposed to, the entire tour tumbled like a card house. 
Because I absolutely had to arrive in Auckland on the date indicated, I had been watching the Emirates‚Äô website and bought a ticket as soon as the date to Auckland became available in October 2022. 
Then, when my needed departure day became available (November 2022), I phoned Emirates and had the departure day changed paying the difference in the cost of the tickets.
First, there was a change in the time of the flight in June. What came into my inbox on June 20, 2023 was an email that looked so much like spam, a poorly phrased text in the local language. No English text at all, so I thought it was better to contact Emirates myself at the number on the corporate website, not the one given in the email.
But at least, an email came in asking me to contact Emirates.
For this next, 24-hour change, there was no email, not in my inbox, nor in the spam folder.
It starts with a surprise at the airport where the lady at the checkin counter cannot explain why my Emirates-issued ticket has me fly all the way to Auckland on the 12th of October, but she is able to check me and my bag only until Dubai.
In Dubai‚Äôs Terminal 2, they finally notice the 24-hour shift of my Dubai > Auckland flight. I am now due to fly on the 13th of October.
I am sent to Terminal 3 to talk to the people at the Emirates desk. There, they say that my ticket has undergone A LOT OF CHANGES, they say that that change is FlyDubai‚Äôs fault and send me back to Terminal 2.
At Terminal 2, I explain my predicament first to a lady, then to a guy named Anes or Anis‚Ä¶ 
Anes/Anis sens me back to Terminal 3 (and all of these rides take 20-30 minutes by bus mind you!) to talk to a Tarvik. Tarvik dials the customer service for me. The customer service people (and I am being sent higher and higher in supervisor level) first state that I have missed my flight. So there was something in the system that showed that I was due to fly out on the 12th of October, not on the 13th!
However, since my flight has already left, the customer service guy says he can‚Äôt be responsible for booking a hotel or providing meal vouchers, customer service can only rebook another flight for me. At the same time, he acknowledges that it is Emirates‚Äô fault.
The Terminal 3 Emirates‚Äô Tarvik says that he cannot book a hotel for me because for that he would need at least a three-day advance notice. (But if the flight and the alleged notification had come in on the 6th of September as they claim, why wasn‚Äôt a hotel booked and meals taken care of?)
Finally, the Terminal 2 FlyDubai guy says that booking a hotel was not something he could do either.
Spent roughly three hours on the phone (and by the way, thank you, Tarvik and another lady who helped me with the phone call), all to no avail. All that going back and forth between Terminals 2 and 3 and being on the phone for that long after a sleepless night was quite an ordeal, I assure you.
As you can see, in short, I was bumped off my flight to Auckland to a flight taking place 24 hours later with no notice, no hotel and meals provided with FlyDubai and Emirates representatives pointing fingers at each other, sending me from Terminal 2 to Terminal 3 and back to talk to folks and still refusing to pay the expenses related to my 24-hour stay in the Dubai Airport for which both companies are responsible. The original 2.5-hour window for my Dubai connection gave me plenty of time to be in time for the Dubai > Auckland flight.
Worst, no one could tell why my Emirates ticket had undergone so many changes unbeknownst to me (the Emirates guy himself was saying that he had never seen so many changes done to a ticket) and who exactly decided that my Dubai > Auckland flight needed to take place 24 hours later.
When similar things happened to me in the past, the airline company would book a hotel and provide meal vouchers. Once, when a Qantas flight was further delayed, I was even reimbursed an extra meal at the airport.
Another airline that introduced a flight change into its schedule kept bombarding me with emails every single week until I contacted them and confirmed I was okay with the change.
I have also read about upgrades in service and other ways of making reparations. Here, I was met with flat-out refusals to do anything about the situation, although the final customer service guy acknowledged that it was Emirates‚Äôs fault. He actually did repeat after me that yes, this is our (meaning Emirates, since the ticket I had bought was a single ticket on Emirates‚Äô website) fault, but no we are not going to provide either a hotel or meals for you, it‚Äôs your problem, if you want to complain, you are welcome to.
Now about complaining. The customer service must have known something suggesting that I go ahead and complain because complaining has yet to produce results. Judge for yourselves:
Sent a complaint on 20 Nov. 2023, received automated acknowledgment immediately, then a customer affairs letter came in on 28 Nov. 2023 promising that the team would review my correspondence and would provide me with a personalised response within 30 days. 
Nothing forthcoming, so on 29 Dec. 2023, I write myself again to Emirates of my own accord.
This time, receive a reply from a Samantha (Emirates Customer Affairs) who suggests I sent receipts of my hotel and food expenses in Dubai as a result of the schedule change ‚Äúfor review and consideration‚Äù. I do that on the same day noting that I sent receipts as part of my original complaint on 20 Nov. 2023 as well. 
Now that all the holidays are past us, the calendar shows 29 January 2024, I have yet to hear from Emirates.
Just in case someone from Emirates is reading this (doubt it since no feedback on behalf of Emirates to any of the reviews preceding mine ‚Äì by the way, speaks volumes about the company), the CASA reference number is 7962085."

I specifically chose an aisle seat because I have neuropathy and needed to ensure I could stand up regularly to avoid blood clots & not disturb others. Immediately, I noticed the man sitting next to me, sharing an armrest with me, that he dominated, was sniffing and digging hard up his nose every couple of minutes nonstop. He would then touch everything around us, including the armrest. Each time he dug up his nose, he would grab the armrest that we shared in common. He also put his hand on my side and touched the screen, picked up something that fell and handed it to me. He was openly digging up his nose and touching everything while sniffing, indicating sickness. I was wearing a mask. He was not. I was grossed out and very concerned for my health and safety. His digging up his nose was not a one time act, but a continuing behavior, every few minutes the entire flight. I told attendants to observe his conduct to see that I was neither making it up nor exaggerating. It was the most disgusting behavior I have ever been forced to endure on a flight. The flight was over 12 hours long and I could not stomach this nasty behavior the long flight and risk my fragile health and safety sitting next to this man. Imagine trying to eat next to him. I spoke to the flight attendants a minimum of three different times. They claimed they could do nothing about his behavior. Their eventual solution after multiple complaints was to move me from my seat up front to the very back of the airplane, far from my colleagues. I was traveling with three companions, two sitting in front of me in aisle seats, and the last one in first class. Our paid seats were the first seats behind economy preferred class. There were dozens of available seats in that section that were close to my companions and only a few feet away from the seat I was sitting in that I paid for. Rather than make my health a priority and move me to a safer section, they wanted to move me to the very back of the large plain far from my paid seat up front.  I didn't want to leave my companions that I was sitting near.  I captured photos throughout the flight of the man digging up his nose next to me and wiping his hands on our common armrest. The only time he used a napkin was when they served food, and he used the napkin they provided for his food to clean his nose. That is the napkin he dropped on me, reaching over me to the stewardess. He then started touching me to retrieve the napkin soiled with his bodily fluids. It was the attendant's jobs to help keep me safe. I wanted to sit in the seat I purchased near the front, on the aisle. I wasn't seeking to be upgraded. But I should not have been penalized and taken to the back of the plane, especially as a black woman- that has racial implications. If those preferred economy seats were the only seats available, in close proximity to the seat I purchased, and also very near my companions; rather than make me sit over 12 hours stressed out trying to lean into the aisle to avoid being contaminated by that man's bodily fluids; and put at a health & safety risk as he openly wiped his bodily fluids on my seat, the armrest & me, they should have moved me to those seats to protect me, not escort me to the back of the plane. I declined for that reason. They could have offered him preferred seating to get him away from me."

This was the best and cheapest option via Dubai to London. However, there was a 10-hour layover in Dubai. My bag went directly through to London. I just got a cheap airport hotel whilst in transit. Checking in online was very easy and I was able to get a window and aisle seat on the two flights. Emirates is a good airline. Bag drop at the airport was also very simple. My bag was slightly overweight but the staff were kind enough to let it go through with no extra charge. Timely and efficient boarding. I expected staff to be a lot friendlier which is my difference here between a 4 and a 5. All appeared fed up. The one air stewardess serving us on the flight from Mumbai to Dubai, was especially very moody! I encountered just one friendly member of staff on board which is unusual for Emirates as their service is normally very good. Clean planes. Comfortable seats with sufficient legroom. Very good inflight entertainment. Charging socket for mobile phone. Toilets were clean but I used the toilet before other passengers! Good meals. Halal. Standard economy options vary by destination. On the flight from Mumbai to Dubai, there was a choice of vegetarian and non-vegetarian. On the flight from Dubai to London, both options for lunch were non-vegetarian. You can check the meals online prior to your flight, or otherwise order a special meal if you have specific dietary requirements. Meals are very generous and big in portion size. Delicious. I am not normally a fan of plane food, but for Emirates, I can make an exception! On the flight from Dubai to London, we flew on the big A380 which is spacious and big. Emirates are normally full so just take one bag on board, if possible. Overhead bin space is limited. I had a small bag which I could easily put under the seat in front of me. Both flights departed reasonably on time. Highly recommend."

When we eventually got meals, they didn't clear in fully so we were left with rubbish and they didn't come through with another clear in. Then we got a snack and they left us all with the trays for a full hour after. So the cabin ended up being full of rubbish and filthy. God knows what the crew were doing. We had a 7.5 hour flight time and we just about got 2 services from them, and they weren't paticularly friendly. The food was pretty bad on this leg as well.

I work as cabin crew for a UK airline, so I know what is possible and what is just laziness on an aircraft.

We'll pay more and go with a different carrier next time. The crew are mostly unfriendly and lazy. Quantas are much much better if you're going Australia."

I love the staff, cabin, and food settings. Approach and experience largely unchanged. I am making comments here on the  little things i miss as a regular in Business... so the tone isnt intended as negative overall. rating is 9-10.
Yes, the same excellent service (although post COVIS when EVERYONE NEEDED TO RECRUIT AND TRAIN NEW STAFF one still - 2 YEARS ON, the sense the staff aren't as knowledgeable or experienced or confident with the food and beverages (especially knowledge of the wines they serve or cocktails - I therefore suspect these aren't people recruited form hotels or bars and it shows) , ambience and food as good as ever overall, I still enjoy the careful and considerate gentle service (always a bit better DXB/ZRH that SYD/DXB), but gradually they are skimping and saving on little things, the cheese portions are halved form 5 years ago, the port has gone form Grahams 20 yr old to the inferior Sandeman 20 yr old (les s luscious and rich). The Dubai made chocolates need a lift too (to my mouth, they are greasy/waxy without the intense chocolate burst needed at altitude). 
Wine feels like  its less mindblowing. Bordeaux is more approachable young, so super aged 15 year olds arent needed anymore as they are far more approachable at 5 years nowadays as winemaking evolved. (going young would mean less of a shaken old bottle with the sediment in suspension, as wines cant practically be decanted on board unless they maybe filter them delicately)
the deal breaker for me is stay on an A380 wherever possible in Bus Class, as the  777 configuration is not true business class anymore. centre seat terrible for mobility and space. When the a380s all retire, I will both mourn, and consider Singapore ailrine or QATAR instead, and will look out for Turkish as it gains slots to Sydney"

However, this trip, especially significant as it was our first flight with our newborn, turned into a distressing ordeal due to misinformation and negligence from Emirates.

Despite clear communication about our family's travel documents, including US green cards and a US passport for our infant, we were incorrectly assured by multiple Emirates customer representatives that we did not require visas for a layover in Dubai. This proved to be false upon arrival, leading to a grueling five-hour wait for visa processing, without access to basic amenities or consideration for our infant.

The experience was exacerbated by the staff's attitude towards us upon learning of our Bangladeshi citizenship, bordering on discriminatory. It was not only a stark contrast to the service we expected but also a failure in providing basic human empathy.

Choosing Emirates, particularly at a higher cost, was a decision made in the hope of ensuring comfort and safety for our family. This trust was broken, overshadowing what should have been a memorable journey with distress and discomfort.

I advise fellow travelers, especially those with young families, to be cautious and verify all information independently when flying with Emirates. This experience has highlighted a serious lapse in customer service and care, which is unacceptable for an airline of Emirates' caliber."

I‚Äôm petite and small in frame so I understand it‚Äôs natural to miss me in the seat, my experience was frustrating and humiliating.
The crew walked past asked the passengers on either side of me for what they would like to eat as light bites and moved forward. I thought they‚Äôd come by and ask me later but nope they just didn‚Äôt seem to notice. 
Next was breakfast, thankfully since I preordered that it was provided but after people beside me finished their meals. The crew realised they forgot to serve my breakfast and then brought it while clearing the trays. 
Throughout the flight I had to go up to the pantry and request for a drink or a snack.
My lunch was hilarious, I was not served till I called for an attendant and requested a juice and they realised they forgot my lunch. By then most passengers finished eating also.
The crew did not even offer any bread also with my meal. Its minimum dining etiquette that is expected from the crew serving.
The crew just seem to forget you exist if you are small and in that particular seat number, while they see to the needs of every other passenger. Ultimately they don‚Äôt even realise you have not been given your meal even when they come to clear trays. 
Very poor service for such an established airline, I think the cabin crew should be more aware of the passengers and their needs and not just be focused on a select set of aisles or rows. 
I understand they are busy throughout the flight attending to multiple requests, no one is perfect, but one bad review can show down the whole establishment.

Additionally passengers bumped into us in our seats on several occasions. It was similar to being in a very busy train station and extremely frustrating. Avoid travelling in business on an A 380 unless you are seated in the front 3-4 rows of the cabin. It took more than one hour after take off to be served a cocktail / drink and after waiting some two hours for the main course I had ordered to be served I informed the crew member not to bother.
The flight in question is about 6 hours in duration and yet one hour before arrival the cabin crew started preparing the aircraft for landing collecting mattresses and blankets and turning up all the lights which meant that there was less than 3 hours in which one could try and rest / relax.

The meal was served 4 hours after take off, there weren't many options, only one meal on an almost 7 hour flight, and when I asked for a yogurt as a snack, which was so very clearly written on the menu provided to be an item thats readily available on demand, the flight attendant acted very surprised at the request and said they dont do that, she later came back with what I had requested, surely after discussing it with another flight attendant and realising her mistake. 

Another instance is when I took out a bag of mixed nuts from my carry on to enjoy while watching a movie, a flight attendant informed that they could provide a complimentary mixed nuts bowl for me, I declined because it should have been offered without me asking or having to take out my own and not as an """"oopsy, we forgot"""".

This bothered many of the other passengers around them, but the cabin attendants did nothing except continue to serve them more drinks, and occasionally laugh and giggle along with them.

Holiday of a lifetime for both myself and wife to celebrate our 60th birthdays, saved for over the past 5 yrs.

Emirates chosen, flights and seats (extra ¬£532) - Didn't actually sit in any of them on any leg.

Emirates changed aircraft on Leg 1 - didn't inform myself that our seats had been changed from two together in economy class on upper deck.

                                               Leg 2 - in light of above, with my wife being upset and not being able to sit just the two of us, I paid another additional ¬£1,230 for business class.

                                               Leg 3 - just allocated random seats, again not what we had paid for.

                                              Leg 4 - were actually finally allocated the correct seats we had paid for HOWEVER, having sat on the aircraft for over 2hrs everyone was offloaded back into the airport, having received no less than 8 emails stating different departure times. My wife by this time was very unwell and unable to walk very far. 
A further Email offering complementary refreshments at restricted outlets, with restricted menu was then received, we were unable to partake of any of these. The airport was is chaos with no one knowing what was actually happening. Eventually we boarded another aircraft some 8 hrs after our scheduled departure, allocated random seats again !

I work for the British Government in Community Safety , Trading Standards , Competition and Markets Legislation and whilst European aviation EASA and CAA applies to certain situations, I would expect the highest of standards from Emirates.

Consequently within 48 hrs of arriving back in the United Kingdom, I received a further Email from Emirates (without prejudice) crediting both my wife's and my Sky rewards with 40000 air miles.

I very much look forward to all the relevant refunds and compensation from Emirates shortly, as United Kingdom relevant legislation requires the complainant to seek remedy with the merchant in the first instance, which should be undertaken promptly and fairly.

Please view my below complaints with regards to our recent and only experience with Emirates, over 4 legs between Manchester Uk and Thailand, via Dubai.

All four legs of journey encountered problems, with not one leg going according to plan.

We booked our holiday of a lifetime seven months in advance and in respect of Emirates paid for specific seating on those four legs, costing an additional ¬£532.00 GBP.  We were not allocated any of our pre-paid seats on any of the four legs.

In order that our holiday start was not ruined, I even paid an additional ¬£1,230 for Business class on our 2nd leg to Thailand as due to operational matters the aircraft was changed.

Our final leg from Dubai to Manchester, resulted in all passengers being offloaded to a aircraft fault and a subsequent delay of nearly 8 hrs.

I understand that things can go wrong, however our experience of all four flights must surely be exceptional, we are both in our 60s and my wife suffers ill health with her legs.

I have submitted the below claim, via Emirates website, having originally being informed that someone from customer services would contact myself, (this apparently is incorrect advice from the Emirates advisor)

Firstly, I went from London to Dubai. My experience at Heathrow could not have been better. Had the luggage tags printed within 5mins of entering the building at the self check kiosks, had the luggages sent off in 5 more. The passport and boarding checks were swift too. It was a seamless smooth operation for everyone involved. 
Even in security checks there was a thorough process.

On my flight back, at Dubai international, I attempted SEVERAL self check kiosks they all flopped. Wasted 10-15minutes stressing.  This may also have been fault with the Emirates app that asks you to check in but doesn't retain the details so you need to check in again more than once. But I think it was mainly the kiosks themselves as I tried multiple options, typing in details and reference, facial recognition, scanning my ticket barcode. None of it worked.
Then in the self-scan passport checks, I was with an elderly relative who couldn't operate the self scanner. The attendant helped with the check but then told her to go around to the manual checks and meet us on the other side. My elderly relative passed the queue thinking as it was already checked once another won't be needed. We were then confronted by one of the classic UAE men guarding the passport desk who decided to be extremely rude and dismissive. When I tried to explain the situation, he aggresively asked why the attendant would send my elderly relative around here. When I said I dont know he mocked me several times and flapped his hands dismissively. I have never been treated so rudely. He than he a tense and gruff conversation with my elderly relative. All in all a stressful situation because of rubbish unhelpful non communicative staff and rude staff. 

Compared to my experience at Heathrow this was upsetting."

0.784516513347626,1.01653707027435,"Emirates Baggage Policy",1,"My mother and I were travelling from Mumbai, India(BOM) to Los Angeles, California(LAX), USA. Every other airport, and even LAX when we were on our way to Mumbai, let us have a carry on bag (backpack, purse, etc.) as well as a carry on roller bag. There was no weight requirement or anything on our way to Mumbai. However, on our way back from Mumbai to LA, we dealt with both Nikhil and Sharda PP from the Mumbai airport ticket counter. We had packed our bags as we liked (we both remote worked during our Mumbai trip so we had our laptop backpacks as well as roller carry-ons. Apparently Emirates just recently implemented a rule where passengers traveling out of India are only allowed 1 carry on bag. Nowhere was this mentioned to us on our ticket or during check in. Nikhil caused us so many problems by weighing our carry on baggage (have never had this done in any other airport) and telling us first that we had excess weight, then telling us that we could only have 1 carry on bag. His solution was to tell us to make two of our bags 32 kg and leave the other two 23kg(the standard weight - Emirates used to actually have 32 kg as the standard weight but I have no idea why they decided to reduce the weight when the planes are the exact same size still). He also mentioned nothing about any sort of payment so we thought that by moving things around and getting the bags to the correct weight requirements we would be all set. Thankfully, we had arrived 3 hours earlier and so had to scramble to reallocate items between our bags which took a solid hour and a half (had a 4:15 am flight and got this done around 2:45 am - 3 am, the flight would be boarding at 3:30 am and we still had to get through security, etc.). Finally, after countless weigh-ins, everything seemed to be in place and our bags were the appropriate 23 kg and 32 kg. Thinking we were in the clear, we get to the ticket counter to get our tickets and hopefully move forward to security. Here is where Sharda PP comes in. First of all, the scale at her counter was not calibrated to 0.0 but rather 0.9 kg (which would add 0.9 kg to the weight of any bag we put on the scale). She then tells us that because we have the 32 kg bags we have an excess in terms of weight and we would need to pay a fee of 6245 rupees. Thinking this was the fee, we were prepared to accept it. Then she drops the bombshell that this fee would apply per person, making it 12490 rupees. Between my mother and I, we did not have this money in cash and after much arguing we succumbed to the pressure (our flight would leave soon and we still had security to get through and our gate to find) we finally had to pay with a credit card. So they made us move all our luggage around, which we had carefully allocated to each bag and was packed away as we liked in an organized fashion, into a more haphazard unorganized way with all of our laptops(my mother's and my work laptop as well as my personal laptop which was brand new) and delicate items going into our roller bags which we did not want to do and still made us pay. They have no empathy at all for the customer and do not understand that we are just trying to get home. My family used to love Emirates and we had used it for our last 3 journeys to India but I think after the way we were treated this time (we have never in our life times of taking Emirates or any airline to India ever paid an excess baggage fee and its not like we had any excess stuff - everything fit in the bag and all 4 were 23kg) we will be looking elsewhere. The service at all aspects of the airline have gone down. My seat tray table was broken (would not close properly), they only brought the hot towels once at the very end(and did not take them back so I had to hold it for a while and ended up leaving it in my seat magazine holder), and the bags they give out (with the socks, eye cover, toothbrush, and toothpaste) were of a way worse quality than usual. Emirates used to be the gold standard but I think with COVID it seems they have tried to cut costs at every corner for the service while still charging a ton of money for the tickets. When on the airline as well, I saw people with a backpack and carry on roller bag so that would mean that this policy is up to the ticket agent's discretion. Nikhil and Sharda, you two really need to learn how to treat people better and not inconvenience them. You guys both seem to think travelling is a joke and that its easy to make someone reorganize their entire life aka their baggage, then turn around and charge them aka kicking them while they are already down. This has been my worst experience with Emirates by far both ways (LAX to BOM and BOM to LAX) and as stated above, I will be looking elsewhere for future trips."

i booked a flight on  September 2023 to fly emirates singapore to seychelles return in  november , transit in dubai both ways,

on my return flight , i was not allowed to check in  , told by emirates staff at the airport and the ticketing office , the cut off for check in was 60 minutes before the flight departed at 8-30am.
i got caught in the traffic jam in the morning arrived at 7-25am ,to find that the check in counter had closed at 7-25am.
a security guard at the airport managed to finally get a staff member from emirates flight, i told her how i was there at 7-25am ,and she didnt seem interested , took my passport details,said she would note that i showed up , but didnt want to admit the desk closed before the 60 minutes cut off.
i was then  was told to go into town and re book my ticket, i was a late show according to the staff at the airport to do anything.to come out and see me around 7-45am , where she told me i could not get on the flight.
the staff at emirates office that i had the misfortune of dealing with  who was the rudest most arrogant staff member i  have ever met at an airline 
,then argued with me that i  was a no show ,and would be charged $360 singapore about $300 USD    to get the next flight that night.
not olny did i get charged the $360 sing they converted it to AUD $ and ripped me off on that as well taking an extra $24 AUD out of the credit card payment, saying that wa the exchange rate once converted as far as they were concerned at emirates.
even though the staff at the airport took down my details and noted i was late but was there

so be careful of fees and penalties emirates has . 
when i complained to emirates online ,i got sent back emails with no reply email address only a first name, and there is no phone complaints or staff at dubai to help .

The drinks that we were offered were very limited and only one during the flight (orange juice, apple juice of water). We booked with Emirates for the excellent service and great plane (Airbus 380 and Boeing 777). Our flight from Amsterdam to Dubai was perfect apart from the delay.

All these time while completing online check in,I was checking the option to change the option to veg meal as all our passengers including my 65 yr old mom is traditionally vegetarians by birth and cannot accept to have non veg meals.By the time when I called the customer careby around 11pm,first of all i would like to raise an official complaint that the lady who spoke to me was so rude(that i have never experienced in the UAE all in my life here that too from a high valued brand from Emirates Airlines!!!!!!)

She is very rude ever and didnt want to even try to help.She says time is over to make a request to change to the veg option.It is completely unacceptable that you can force someone to eat what you give afterall it is part of your service you provide to your customer.And she has told me that if i want vegetarian,i can bring it with me.Sorry but that is not what we expect from a international company,not a local airlines though.

There should be atleast option in the airline booking to change the veg/non options-that is very basic.
Or customer care person should have atleast shown the service/attitude to asisst the customer to say that the request is made,but not guaranteed etc-but I have got the worse service ever!
This experience has made me down to the high expectation services from Emirates Airlines,if your customer care is providing such services.

On the way back from Delhi to NYC the rude check in staff informed us that they recently changed their rules on flights departing from India and men are not allowed to carry a handbag - that counts as a second carry on bag and is not allowed.

I am actually so upset and emotional from the way I have been treated and how I have had my time wasted. To summarize my issue, I was trying to book flights for myself, my husband and my 5 month old baby to the U.S. and I wanted to add a stopover in Dubai due to the fact the the shortest layover time was 2 hours and would be extremely rushed considering that I would be traveling with a baby. The next flight had a layover of 18 hours which is really long to be stuck in an airport with a baby. The best idea was to book a stopover so we could spend a few days in Dubai before heading to the U.S on another 15 hour flight. The issue I had was that I kept getting a booking error stating that my booking could not be confirmed. I tried over and over, having to start all over again each time. 3 hours later I was able to complete my booking but without the stopover. Under my booking, it gave me the option to add the stopover but at an additional cost. I contacted customer support who stated that they could waive the change fee as an exception and quoted me a reasonable amount I would need to pay due to the fare difference which I was more than happy with. I accepted this and was ready to do the payment however the agent encountered an issue and could not make the necessary changes. He asked me to fill out a form to get assistance and I did so. I only received a response the next day by email and when I tried to reply, the email could not be sent. I had to reach back out to customer support to ask them how to respond and they said I would need to fill out a new form each time. I did this again and waited almost another day for a response. They then told me that the account administrator would need to authorize any changes made to my booking as the booking was made through a business rewards account under the company I work for. I had to reach out to many people requesting for this to be done for me by having the account administrator fill out the form with the details for the change. I also asked multiple times regarding the change fee that I was told would be waived and I was reassured that they will assist me once the account administrator authorizes the changes. Keep in mind that each time a form was filled out to find out what I need to do, it would take a day to receive a response each time. This whole back and forth took 5 days of me contacting every single day multiple times to get assistance as quickly as possible. The changes were finally made and I had to pay the change fee. When I inquired about having this waived like I was promised, I was told ‚Äúsorry we can‚Äôt assist you as the time frame has lapsed‚Äù. As I have explained in detail, none of this was my fault, the initial booking gave me an error which was on Emirates part not mine and the communication has been awful and difficult to get assistance which once again is on Emirates part and not once was a time frame mentioned to me. The reason the process took so long was due to having to fill out forms and wait long periods of time only to receive different information from each new agent who would reply by email and not give me clear information or who would not understand my query and give me the information I needed and now I‚Äôm told that the time frame has passed and I cannot be assisted. The last agent I spoke to even went on to tell me that the only thing I can do is fill out a complaint form on the Emirates website regarding my experience. I have been treated so badly and I am here to share this experience in the hopes of saving someone else from going through the same and feeling absolutely hopeless at this point. I wish Emirates would just take accountability and offer me some kind of solution or something, anything, to make this awful experience just a little better and restore my hopes."

Last year, we booked a flight to Munich with emirates and we had my Down syndrome sister with us, before take off, my sister was in slight pain and since she can‚Äôt take pain killer pills easily we kindly asked the staff if they had liquid pain killer with them, they said okay and they will bring it, they came back to us and told us that the doctor will need to check her out before they can give her the medicine even though we knew her case and it was normal pain and we just wanted pain killer like any other person would ask for. They refused to accept our answer. We tried to tell them that we will take the risk and sign any papers taking the full risk but they refused and kept insisting on us leaving the flight. We are a family of 8 and all of us got up to leave but they said that they can‚Äôt guarantee us catching another flight and only my Down syndrome sister (who is mentally challenged) need to leave. How can they expect her to leave on her own?. They then told us that the pilot insisted on her leaving and when we told them we‚Äôll speak to the pilot, they again refused. Eventually, after humiliating us in front of the other passengers and treating my Down syndrome sister as if she is not human, her and two of my sisters left the flight. When they got to the doctor at the airport, he told them that she is absolutely fine, nothing is wrong with her and she shouldn‚Äôt have left in the first place and that they never spoke to him to begin with. They called the flight to check if it took off and the crew said it did even though we were still on ground and were keeping in touch with them.
Elie Srieh and Manar Scarf were absolutely distasteful to us through the whole flight as well and barely spoke to us when we needed anything.
I am finally speaking out because when we tried to raise a complaint immediately after, they asked my mentally challenged sister to write it herself which absolutely does not make any sense."

We reached at the T3 airport checkedin counter and the arab guy (unfortunately, I did not had a chance to get his name, but the only thing I remember is he has a braces on his teeth), he did not even greeted us ‚ÄúHi‚Äùor ‚ÄúGood evening‚Äù because he was busy chitchatting with his colleague (they are both speaking in arabic). So I handed over our passport to him and after that I was giving the ticket as well but he did not pay attention at all instead he continued chatting with his colleague. The chit chatting continues and his colleague left finally after around 7minutes. Then he asked our tickets. So he checked and entered in the system and knowing that we have a different ticket as I booked mine and my sister booked by her company but he told us, I will combine your baggage so you have total of 60KG, we agreed coz we don‚Äôt see anything wrong with that, we are family and we are traveling together. So here is the annoying part, he asked us to weigh in the luggage,  we have total 5 luggages mine was 3 and my sister has 2. So he told us to put 4pieces together to scale and the total was 39+ kg, I was the one who was checking the number so in my mind I calculated that we have around 21kg more left, so he move the belt to weigh in the remaining 1 luggage, he asked us to put and it was showing 22+kg only. After that he started doing his magic trick! Would you believe we were told that we are 6KG excess coz our total luggage was 66KG!!! Unbelievable!! I told him, how come, it was 39+ on the 1st batch and the 2nd was 22+ so technically we are only 2KG excess which if you will divide for 2 passenger, it will only sum of 31KG each, which is totally acceptable by the airlines even if we have 1kg excess each. We traveled emirates most of the time and they always allow us max 32KG. He keeps insisting that the total was 66KG and either we have to remove 6kg, take it and transfer to a hand carry or pay. Since there was a small box on one of our luggages, so he was telling to take it with us and keep it as a hand carry but we told him that there‚Äôs a liquid item there which is more than 100ml. He really think we are fool and it‚Äôs our first time traveling. Beside, we have more than enough hand carry luggages and they will not allowed us to carry the small box if we will take it, we will end up leaving it at the airport for no reason. He insisted again that we can take the small box but we insisted to him the liquid bottle. he was acting like he doesn‚Äôt know anything coz about the luggage rules and the liquid size rules and he was telling us that ‚Äúreally they will not allow you to carry the 100+ml bottle?‚Äù And he even reconfirmed it with his colleague. So, I what I did, when me and my sister are almost losing our hope, and since I‚Äôm 100% sure with the numbers I saw 39+ and 22+ KG, so I requested him to move back the previous batch of luggage and check it again and you know what happened next, he immediately acted that he will take a break (coz he knew I was telling the truth), his colleague was there standing next to us was to the rescue immediately and took his seat, the arab staff left immediately. The new guy who rescued him was there listening to us when we were trying to explain things with his colleague and he knew what we were discussing. So when he started weighing again the luggage, it gave us the correct weight 39+kg and the other one was 22+kg, i told him that that was the initial and correct weight, I don‚Äôt know what your colleague was saying that we are total of 66kg and has excess of 6kg. 
So the guy gave us our boarding pass and baggage ticket without telling us we are excess or we need to pay or remove from our luggage. 
We were in a hurry that time as we need to fill in our e-travel pass hence we didn‚Äôt had a chance to get the name of that arab ground staff. 

To EMIRATES, I look highly of you, I always choose to travel with you whenever there is a chance, even though sometimes traveling with you are costly, but I always look for comfort, quality service (world class rather) and trust, but if this is the kind of employee you have who is trying to cheat your passengers, I think I have to double think this time when booking flights, I need to be vigilant on your ground crews otherwise I will be deceived again. Imagine, you are tired from work and you miss your family back home, you want to see them after a long time, so all you want is a peaceful/smooth travel/journey experience right from checking in to take-off and landing, but instead this poor customer service and a cheating staff will welcome you at the airport. We both are really sad that this happened to us. It was unpleasant, traumatic and stressful experience, Emirates. We hope you will do something on your staff‚Äôs behavior as it‚Äôs not a good practice. We hope that they were not trained for cheating.

Please note that we had this experience in the past as well and we just let that go, but this time we want to share our experience coz it is not right anymore. People need to be aware.

Always been a dream to fly on this big bird.. wasn't disappointed at all!

Starting with the cons since there was just one major con. The big difference in the overall experience between my flights from BOM to DBX and DBX to MUC. Even though they were both A380s, the flight from Dubai to Munich was much better, the quality of interiors, service, food, everything was so much better. It kind of overpowered the first connection between Mumbai & Dubai, wish it had the same quality standards.

A second con could be the price, even though I got luck with a medium range ticket, Economy costs for this airline can be ridiculously priced at times.

Pros - There are many but considering this was my first international experience, I dont have much to compare with.
Quality - Everything was top-notch, perfect
Food - Food was amazing, loved it
Service - The best I have experienced to far, especially in my second flight from Dubai to Munich, the service was fantastic.

Conclusion - Totally worth it, even if it costs a little more than the rest."

I flew Manchester to Sydney in October and returned yesterday. I cannot believe how the standard has dropped!! On my premium economy return flight from Sydney to Dubai I was given an apple juice or water not long before take off.  It was a couple of hours before I received my meal (less said the better). It was then 7 hours before anyone came round with drinks of water etc. Admittedly you can go find them and ask for water, but that how it used to be. Friendly is not a word to describe them. Not bothered would be more like it.  On the flight from Dubai to Manchester, no glass of water or anything before the flight, no hot towels which we used to be given.

As a GF person, the food was really good on both legs and I had plenty to eat. If you would like Diet Pepsi you need to ask specifically for it as they have little cans otherwise it‚Äôs normal Pepsi out of a larger bottle. 

Service is what really let things down. Meal and drink service was very random as on one flight they had trolleys from the front and back of economy to get service done quickly and on the second flight it was from the front to back. Also, drinks were served quite randomly with a tray of juices and water being served to half of economy during afternoon tea but the other half had to wait until the meal service came round. It was easier just to pop to the galley to ask for a drink.

I am a specialized cardiologist based in Germany. On Flight from D√ºsseldorf to Dubai, I found myself in a situation where my medical expertise was called upon to address a life-threatening emergency. I am sure that your records will confirm the incident, where I provided essential medical treatment to a passenger who had a heart attack.

During the approximately 6-hour delay caused by the emergency, I dedicated almost 3 hours on board, administering necessary medical care, including Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and cardio shocks. This effort resulted in the successful revival of the passenger. Subsequently, upon emergency landing in Istanbul, I provided a debrief to the medical staff, ensuring the patient's stability.

While I understand that delays and emergencies are part of the unforeseen challenges in the airline industry, I must express my disappointment that I have not received any communication from Fly Emirates since the incident. A simple thank-you letter or a gesture of appreciation would go a long way in recognizing the extraordinary circumstances that occurred during this flight.

I acknowledge that my profession entails responding to emergencies without expecting personal gain. However, given the unique circumstances and the impact on my family, who had to endure the situation alone for a significant portion of the flight, a small acknowledgment from Fly Emirates would be highly appreciated.

I believe that recognizing such instances fosters a positive relationship between passengers and the airline. I look forward to your understanding and hope for a prompt acknowledgment of this matter.

After take off, the head steward did come over and advised that he would sort it out for us, so went away to write his report for half an hour, then came back and advised us that we could in fact move, which we were grateful for. 
However thank goodness we had taken the middle and window seats, as we were unable to sleep with one of the young stewardesses banging the trolley into the end chair, I would have for given it once, but she reversed back and did it again, without adjusting her angle so she could get through. This happened every time the trolley went out, which really annoyed and disturbed us. Then during Breakfast, I declined the breakfast but requested some water, and a cup of hot water which was clearly ignored, so had no drink until lunch.
The final straw was when the stewardess came back past us carrying a tray from lunch and dropped it just next to my sister near the empty chair, and although she picked up the crockery and tray, she left the contents of the dessert on the floor, for anyone to slip on, which is a health and safety issue.
We have come to Bangkok to collect our mother to bring her back to the UK, and it terrifies me to think, that my mother and I will not get the pre paid seats we paid for, as she is frail and not able to walk far to use the bathroom, or use stairs to get in them,  she needs does her seat near a convenient with easy access lavatory with us next to her to assist, then she will not make it in time.

Additionally, I was surprised to be asked for the receipt of the used bag. Unfortunately, I was not aware in advance that the airline would require such documentation, and therefore, I did not retain the original receipt for the bag.
I believe it is essential to highlight that passengers may not anticipate the need for a bag receipt when traveling, especially when the bag is not new. I urge Emirates to review its policies and procedures to ensure that passengers are adequately informed about potential damage risks and any documentation requirements in advance."

Before the flight I was bit worried as the seat width was supposed to be 17  inches, which does sound rather narrow and I'm not the slimmest person. Surprisingly the (aisle) seat on my flight from Hamburg to Dubai was pretty comfy, both in legroom and seat width. Plane interior seemed a bit newer.
The seat on the flight Dubai to Brisbane was still ok but less so than on the first leg. Plane interior seemed pretty old and thus the seat somehow felt more restricted. The armrests were less favorable. 

Emirates crew is generally pretty good, also so on these flight. Just found it weird that when I asked to switch seats to a nearly empty front row on the second flight, they told me I had to pay 188 dollars if I wanted to switch. Not used to that from Emirates. 

Food is generally pretty good on Emirates flights and on an overnight flight they come around several times with water and juice. Could have been a bit more often, but was ok.

Emirates decided to now cancel all flights to and from Tel Aviv until the 30th of March. Our original flights were on February as she turns 2 in March. While we were offered to change our flights to April and the operator wrote it will be free of charge at the end she asked from us to pay the child fare which is more than 1,600 USD.

LAX Emirates Lounge - very nice, good service, good food. I had access via my Gold Emirates Mastercard which gives me Gold Status with the airline.

I paid for the extra legroom/ bulkhead seat 67H. $170 extra each way. Not greeted by Purser for being Gold Member before takeoff. Good news was nobody was sitting next to me. Bad news: 67H (aisle) seat seat seems a bit smaller than 67J. I moved to 67J after take off. Plenty of legroom. Lavatory line tends to stand in your legroom space. Flight attendants sit in the jump-seats in front of you on take-off and landing. Screaming kids next to me for 90% of the flight. I mean really screaming. Obnoxious. My noise cancelling headphones couldn't silence the wails of these children. When the kids finally went to sleep, their parents were babbling with each other the whole trip. The lady behind me in the famous 68K seat (that seat that has no seat in front of it so it allows direct access to the bulkhead area) was constantly getting up and moving back and forth to the bulkhead area, jabbering on her phone in Chinese and disturbing me.  Non stop. No sleep the whole 16 hr flight.

DXB to LAX - My cousin, who was traveling with me on a different flight home, had purchased an upgrade to business class with no lounge access included. I tried to get him into the lounge via my Gold Membership. No dice. I understand the """"Same flight for Gold Guest"""" policy but come on Emirates! The guy just shelled out for a $1300 upgrade and you couldn't throw in a 2 hr visit to the lounge? Allow a Gold Member to take him in as a guest? So petty. I had the points for the business upgrade but decided not to. Big mistake.

Sat in 80H (bulkhead / extra legroom seat). Greeted by the Purser for being a Gold member. Nobody in my row. As soon as we board, a guy in the forward economy cabin starts making this burping / gagging / puking sound that I could hear in the back economy cabin. I think he started to puke before we were airborne. Who knows what this guy was spreading throughout the cabin?The kid next to me starts screaming. As we get airborne they move the puking guy about 5 rows behind me so he can lay down. 16 hours of non-stop disgusting burping / gagging/ puking sounds and a screaming child. Absolute disaster. Got home and found out my cheap phone charger was stolen from my suitcase. I didn't lock it up so it's my fault.

Lesson learned. I'll never fly economy long haul again. There is just too much savage behavior by the general public out there these days."

Yes it was during covid times as I had to visit my family during their emergency and with my then 8 months old son. The staff of emirates, whether at the front desk or at the flights were beyong unprofessional, they were inhuman.
 On my leg from Dublin to Dubai, they lied to me that I would get my baby stroller at Dubai and took away my baby stroller at the flight gate. I was atleast provided with a bassinet for my child to sleep. With a 8 months old and recovering from a C-section I had to walk for minimum 25 mins to cover the distance from one flight to the my connecting flight from Dubai to Kolkata, in Dubai airport without stroller, Dubai airport also stopped the free stroller service at the airport. During the time of covid, when we were asked to maintain distance from other passengers during the whole flight, I was pushed to an edge to take support from others to even walk with a baby and carry on luggage. I was not even given the assiatnce because as per them """"i have not booked it"""".  I somehow took the flight to Kolkata and hoped this nightmare had ended, butthe worse was waiting. 
On my return leg from Kolkata-Dubai-Dublin, I was treated like an animal. I had a layover of 12 hrs in Dubai, this time I made sure the stroller is not taken away from me and fought for it at the Kolkata airport, I booked an in-airport accomodation and again made sure to get the stroller in-flight for the Dubai-Dublin flight which was nearly 8 hrs flight. The first hurdle came when I was not provided with a bassinet for my then 9.5 months old son, not because bassinet was not available, this was because the air hostess thought my son is older than 11 months. When I said I can show the passport, she then changed the excuse saying he is tall for a bassinet. I told her that I was given a bassinet for him on my previous flights, but she just didnt want to help me. I was a new mother travelling with my child and here I met people with absolute apathy in service industry. Because it was an 8 hrs flight I expected some food on flight, but in breakfast we were given one croissant, one yoghurt and for my son, one small ella smoothie. I didnt realise that there would be no food for me or for my child otherwise I would had bought soemthing from the airport, neither on tickets it said limited availability of food. But here i am with nothing as such to keep me or my son going. Since it was a morning flight I didnt have time for breakfast, and with a child I was struggling to keep up with everything. I waited for lunch, and they served me beef. When I said due to my religious beliefs I dont eat beef, the response of the airhostess was, take it or leave it. I asked for vegetarian option, and she further denied.  I was in tears. I was hungry, tired, as the child was sleeping on me as well as cranky due to uncomfortable sleeping. He couldnt sleep as there was no bassinet. This is a flight of a muslim nation, treating a non-M like a piece of sh!t. 
Imagine if only p0rk could be served to a M on a 10 hrs flight, this would had been circulating on social media like wildfire. I was thankful to my fellow Irish passengers who helped me with some baby food for my child. 
I will never forgive Emirates for hurting my religious sentiments and treat me like an animal. This airline is H!nduPhobic and also racist. Their staff is biased and hinduphobic. Thinking about this experience still bring tears."

I underwent a spinal surgery in Dubai and booked a wheelchair since I was strongly advised not to walk/ stand for more than 10 minutes at the time with 30 minutes breaks. I did not have a great experience with ground staff especially for the wheelchair. I ended up walking to the gate therefore I was in serious pain when I reached the plane. At the time of check in, I requested a front seat since I kept having to stretch my legs to release pain from my spine. I was told only the cabin crew members on the plane can do that since those seats are reserved (basically cost an extra 400AED). As I entered the plane, I requested a crew member to help with allocating a seat and I was told that he cannot since these are paid seats. I presented my medical report from my surgeon and I was so lucky that Mr Dragan was standing there. The crew member then asked this gentleman and without any delays he looked at my condition and medical spine brace I was wearing and didn't think twice to allow it, making my trip much easier. I was obviously in agonising pain but the last thing you need in such situation is worrying about disturbing all the people sitting next to you and having to continuously ask them to allow you out etc. These are some people and moments that in today's world are becoming rarer and rarer, sadly. However when we experience them, I think it is important to appreciate these still-remained-humans so it can encourage and inspire others to be like them. It really doesn't take much to be nice or to express empathy. It is on the hand so easy to say No, without considering what that simple two letter word can do to a person! In our capitalist world, when money is involved, it's so easy to forget that we are human first! This is not even money going out of airline staff or crew members pocket. So how wonderful would it be if all crew members could be more like Mr Dragan. I express my utmost gratitude to this gentleman for your kindness, empathy and care.

Then we were dumped in a large hall with other disabled people, many of whom were upset because we were all told to just sit and eventually a wheelchair would come for you.

1.2785530090332,2.46568512916565,"Emirates Baggage Issues",2,"I flew with Emirates Airlines from Australia on the 1st of October this year, and I regret to report a highly disappointing experience with their customer service regarding a damaged suitcase. Upon my arrival, I discovered that my suitcase was severely damaged, to the point where it was broken into pieces. This was an unusual and distressing situation that significantly marred what was otherwise a pleasant flight.
At the airport, I promptly reported the damage and received a damage report. However, the real challenge began when I had to follow up on the replacement of my suitcase, as I needed it for my return journey to Australia. Despite my efforts, the replacement never materialized, forcing me to put my holiday on hold.
The only accessible avenue for assistance was the online chat feature on their website. The support I received from this platform, however, was far from satisfactory. The best resolution the online chat team could offer was to send an email to their IR (Incident Report) team, with no immediate solution or assistance provided. I was repeatedly asked to wait until the IR team contacted me.
A month passed, during which I engaged in four separate online chat sessions, each time receiving the same response - """"Wait until you're contacted."""" This lack of proactive communication and action from Emirates was extremely frustrating and left me with no other choice but to borrow a suitcase to make my return journey to Australia. Moreover, I now have the added burden of having to post the borrowed suitcase back to its owner at my own expense.
While the flight itself was indeed pleasant, the experience with Emirates' customer service has been nothing short of disappointing, rendering the overall experience far less enjoyable. The inability to provide a timely and efficient resolution to a problem as basic as a damaged suitcase demonstrates a lack of support and reliability on their part, and this has left me greatly dissatisfied with their service.
I sincerely hope that Emirates Airlines will take this feedback into account to improve their customer service and ensure that future passengers do not face similar issues."

We were due to fly at 22:15pm, however, we actually didn‚Äôt lift off until 22:58 pm, almost 45 minutes late. I‚Äôm not sure why, as we were not informed or kept up to date by anyone.
¬†
During our night flight, after having eaten our meals, and having this all cleared away and the lights dimmed, the passengers all went to sleep. However, sadly we were not given this opportunity.
¬†
The flight attendants stood in the kitchen consistently talking extremely loud throughout our entire journey. Myself and the other passengers in front of us, all asked them to keep their voices down, as we were all trying to sleep, but just they continued to chat and laugh with no consideration for the passengers need for sleep.
¬†
The curtain across the kitchen was not drawn, so the bright lights were continuously shining in our eyes. The staff were also banging around with no consideration for those trying to sleep. They would consistently open cupboards near our heads and then bang them shut again, to get out the paper cups for passengers. They were not remotely considerate and didn‚Äôt even try to reduce their noise level at any point throughout the flight.
¬†
The flight attendants also never asked passengers to close their blinds, so the bright sunshine kept us wide awake too, whilst the sun was rising in the early hours of the morning.
¬†
I found it really bizarre that the staff were exceptionally quiet when walking up and down the aisles with the duty free brochure, and seemed reluctant to disturb anyone at this point. But this was not the case once they were back in the kitchen, or even sitting next to the kitchen.
¬†
The staff sat in the fold up seats behind us, were talking right across the gangway, to their colleagues in kitchen, with absolutely no consideration for us trying to sleep.
They were even leaning over our seats, to have conversations at several points.
¬†
We asked them several times to close curtains and to keep the noise down. They were also asked several times by myself and others passengers to speak quietly, but they just ignored our pleas and carried on.
¬†
When any passengers came to ask them any questions, they were exceptionally loud whilst offering an answer, and did not remotely lower the volume of their response, especially given it was a night flight and everyone else was asleep!
¬†
My earphones were not working, but getting a response from any staff was so slow, especially given we were sat right next to them. My earphones only ever worked in one ear, even after changing them several times, but no-one even tried to offer any resolution. The staff were unfriendly and very abrupt and seemed unhappy to be disturbed by passengers.
¬†
No-one even took our rubbish and we were left with dirty cups and broken headphones throughout the flight! They only collected dinner, but nothing else.
¬†
On our flight from Mauritius to Dubai on 26.06.23 at 21:50 flight EK704, we again experienced very similar disappointment. So clearly the first flight was not a one-off.
¬†
I asked the flight attendants several times if they could close the curtains to the kitchen, as the bright lights were shining directly in my eyes on the night flight and I was unable to sleep.
¬†
Surely It‚Äôs just courteous to allow passengers an opportunity to gain some sleep on a night flight. I‚Äôm sure that the staff would not behave like this around their first class passengers!
¬†
I must have asked them to draw the curtains at least 10 times, so I could get some sleep, but instead, the woman just gave me a mask to cover my eyes with!
¬†
Then on our flight from Dubai to London Heathrow on 28.06.23 flight EK 029, it was due to take off at 09:49am, but didn‚Äôt lift off until 11:05am, with a 1 hour and 16 minutes delay. In Dubai airport in our boarding lounge, there were just not enough staff to get all if he passengers through quickly enough in time for our flight. The queues went on for ages and were barely moving, so we were still only just boarding, by the time when we should have been taking off. ¬†

After seeking specific advice from their staff in relation to my accessible needs, I was advised to pay an additional ¬£160 to secure our specific seats away from others, due to my poor health and physical disabilities and needing a quiet seat where I could get some sleep. Sadly, they completely refused to consider refunding any of this additional cost, after our extremely poor and disappointing experience. 

This was literally my worst flight ever on any other airway! This was my very first experience of flying Emirates, as I thought they had a really good reputation. However, sadly, it will probably be my last, as I‚Äôve had much better experiences on cheap budget airlines! 

Just to add insult to injury, during my flight, my integrated combination suitcase lock was completely smashed and broken on my case and all three of our luggage tags were broken and completely lost too. I‚Äôm not sure how they handle the suitcases, but clearly not with any care and consideration! 

In addition to this, I was then unable to make a formal complaint. When I contacted Emirates, I was given an email address that would not work. So I called them again and was advised this email was incorrect and not accessible to customers. I was advised to use their online form, but when I tried to complete this on their website to submit my complaint, it would not submit, due to requiring a ticket number. I had to call them yet again for support in submitting my complaint, by which time, most customers would have given up! 

They made it exceptionally difficult to raise a complaint with them and then we‚Äôre not remotely interested in supporting, acknowledging or resolving my complaint, once it was finally received. Extremely disappointing experience, extremely poor customer services and no consideration or genuine support for those with disabilities! Shame on you Emirates!"

As a frequent flyer with Emirates, I had high expectations for the experience. Unfortunately, my recent experience was far from satisfactory and it left me wondering if Emirates is discriminating against Pakistani passengers.

The London to Dubai leg of the journey was fine, as expected. The aircraft was clean and the customer service was good, as per the Emirates standard. However, everything changed drastically from Dubai to Islamabad. The aircraft was in a terrible condition - it was so bad that if we hadn't seen out of the window, we would not have felt like we were in an aircraft, let alone an Emirates aircraft. The seats were broken, the overhead compartments were leaking, the windows were vibrating, the recliners were broken, and the food tray was taped up. It was dirty, to say the least.

It seemed to me that Emirates was deliberately providing terrible aircraft for Pakistani routes, perhaps considering Pakistani passengers as inferior. Passengers flying from Dubai to Pakistan may not even realize that they are facing discrimination. Despite charging the same for a better experience, Emirates is offering Pakistani passengers flights in what seems to be expired aircraft.

Usually cabin crew are friendly and helpful but unfortunately my last flight was not the case. I only flew economy but like to go with Emirates and pay more on the basis of thr service is usually excellent (other airlines in economy are cheaper) . It was just odd I always thank cabin crew as I know they work hard but my flight from the UK to dubai people in my section just were not friendly. Food arrived cold and I don't mean lukewarm I mean cold. I thanked staff for taking things away and there was silence, not even a smile or sign of acknowledgement. Flight from Dubai to Bali was beautiful, friendly smiley staff who seemed genuinley happy in their job. 

Flight back. Bali to Dubai - terrible. Again just not friendly service. Everyone was friendly when arriving in the plane and departing but service in my section again was just terrible. A cabin crew member cleared away our food ( which I thanked them for as always) however she forgot a knife. I held the knife ready for her to take, she lent over me to the next person to take their tray then went to the other side without taking the knife which was very clearly there for here to take. I tapped her on the shoulder to give it to her she said wait and continued to clear away other people's trays before taking this. Might seem a bit pedantic but just seemed cold. 

Next the person in front of me reclined their chair all the way back to sleep (absolutely fine you've paid for this service) I move my chair back half way as I don't want to sleep yet need some space. Next thing cabin crew tell me to put my chair all the way forwards. The manner was outrageous, it was a tap on the shoulder with a simple 'move your chair forward'. No please, no smile, no thank you. I would have thought if for whatever reason I had to move my chair forward they would at least ask the person in front to move theirs a little also ? It was more upsetting the manner in which this was done. Anyway I spent the rest of the flight in an awkward upright position which was not relaxing or what I paid Emirates prices for. Flight from Dubai to London was lovely - friendly staff, polite, smiley again seemed happy to do their job. 

I never usually have issues with Emirates hence my prefered airline however this is not the experience I was hoping for and didn't set a good start or finish from my relaxing holidays. Will definitely be looking at other airline for any future long haul flights."

The seats have plenty of room and the 23inch tv screen makes for wonderful viewing.  The only downside is you can't tilt it in anyway as it is fixed.  The welcome drinks were nice of Moet Champagne or orange or apple juice. You are offered a menu with selection of entree, Main and Dessert as well as spirits, wine, soft drinks and coffee or tea.  The cabin crew are lovely and very polite and as my husband is a lifetime Gold QANTAS frequent flyer the chief flight attendant came to introduce herself to my husband and to let him know if we needed anything at all not to hesitate to ask them.  The two outer row's have two seats side by side but the centre isle seats have three seats.  It would be annoying to be in the middle seat as you have to climb over your neighbour to get out but you also have to do this if you have a window seat as well.  The privacy is okay as you do have privacy screens between the seats but you can still see your neighbours tv.  The mattress topper is a nice addition together with a very comfy pillow both of these makes it feel more like a bed as your seat lays flat and makes for a reasonably comfortable bed in the sky.  The meals offered are very nice and having proper crockery and cutlery is also enjoyable to eat with.  All in all the Emirates Boing 777-300 is certainly pleasant enough however I much prefer their A380.  Business Class on the A380 is amazing."

My son SANTIAGO traveled from Dubai to London on the 7th October 2023. Santiago has a cognitive impairment and obviously I was very anxious about him traveling by himself. I chose to travel Emirates because i know the quality of the services. I called the airline a few days in advance and requested assistance throughout his journey in Dubai as well as upon arrival at Heathrow. Same for the way back. Upon arriving at T3 at DXB we went straight to the desk where they give you the sunflower lanyard. I wanted my son to have it in case the requested assistance wasn't arranged by the airline. At the counter we were met by one of the Airline staff. He called an agent who came and took my son all the way through security and dropped him at the gate for London. This was already a huge relief for me as a mother of a POD traveling for the first time by himself. But there was still the scariest part, the arrival at a daunting, massive airport like Heathrow where many a time I myself have had multiple troubles arriving and leaving from London. But then again, Emirates was right there, by the plane exit waiting for my son. Someone took care of him and delivered him safe and sound to my 2 kids who were waiting for him at the airport. When I got his message that he was already reunited with his family I finally could relax. 
Today he arrived back from London. Same thing. At Heathrow they had someone from Emirates accompanying Santi from the counter all the way to the gate.  Arriving in Dubai someone from the airline accompanied him to the baggage belt. 
I cannot express my gratitude to all of  the Emirates Airlines staff who made my son's biggest dream ( traveling alone to be reunited with his siblings ) come true.  I was very proud of my son who wanted to live the experience but we couldn't have done it without the help and the generosity of the best airline in the world. One more time, THANK YOU EMIRATES AIRLINES for everything. You are a true representative of the culture of Dubai and the UAE where people of determination can live a fulfilled, happy and safe life.
Forever grateful

But yesterday 16OCT2023 when I was travelling back I was stopped by Danata staff who was standing before approaching the Lahore airport immigration area, he took my boarding pass asked me to keep my hand carry bag and laptop bag on scale and was like the weight is approx 15kg I have to go back and check with the supervisor, he handed over my boarding pass to Emirates airline team sitting at the check-in counter, I told them that I was in Pakistan for my frozen shoulder treatment, unfortunitly I had an accediten and had serious head injury on 04SEP2023. I was addmited in Services hospital Lahore for almost 10 days. Even after recovery I'm having spells of diziness. Even I told them that in my laptop bag I took my medicnes, medical reports and eyesight glasses along with laptop that's why its like this I can't leave the medican and no one informed me or asked to check the weight at Dubai Airport when I was travelling to Lahore in august why you are checking the weight now?? they said you are 5 kg overweight we can't let you go. Even though I showed them the mediciens they didn't return my boarding pass, flight time was 9AM Pakistan time and I was requesting them till 8:20AM for my boarding pass. At last they told me the solution is only I have to checkin my handcarry luggage and pay for access baggage but they charged me PKR 29,340 which was for 7 KG. I asked them why you are charging me for 7 KG if I was overweight for 5kg but they didn't responede. no one even told me Why they combine the weight of handcarry bag and laptop bag??? They were very rude, uncoprative and bullying dispite me medical condition. Now my question is same on your website no where is mentioned that you will count the weight of laptop bag also. Everyone knows bags have there own weight as well, why you are not informing in advance that now passenger will be charged for handcarry bag if passenger is carrying laptop bag too. This is really very bad rule as you are applying different rule in UAE and different rule in pakistan you are not considering the condition of your traveller. I really need a compensation on the same I was not fit medically and your team gave me tenstion I'm debitic patient too my blood sugar was shotup beacuse of this tenstion, my frozen shoulder pain is aggrivated since yesterday in short I'm back to square for my frozen shoulder treatment. If there are any changes in rules do mention the same on the ticket and keep same on every airport stop treating differntly each country. This is really no acceptable. I really want compensation for the same, I am really disappointed with airport staff. I will never travel with you guys nor my any family member, no my friends will travel with you.

Several records were broken for me as a flight passenger on Emirates in 2 days. First I was separated from my wife of 35 years and then despite my plea of a stiff shoulder I was given a window seat in all my 42 years of flying.

Emirates seem to treat its tour group passengers as 2nd class passengers without any rights.
My wife and I flew to Spain and Portugal from Singapore on a packaged tour with a travel group. 

On our return flights first from Madrid to Dubai on EK142 on 9 Oct 2023 and from Dubai to Singapore on EK 354 on 10 Oct 2023, my wife and I were placed on window seats on the opposite sides of the aircraft. When I enquired at the check in counter for an aisle seat for the 2 flights as I am a tall bloke with a stiff shoulder (which has been affecting me for the past 5 years), the staff gave me an aisle seat further back and my wife in a window seat 6 rows ahead. 

She said she tried but could not see the connecting flight seating plan from Dubai to Singapore and advised me to approach the boarding gate in Dubai for help. 

When we reached Dubai, the tour manager, my wife and I, another another couple who had been in opposite ends of the aircraft made a beeline for the connecting help desk close to B18 boarding gate.
The guard refused to let us into the queue even though there was no one queuing and the 2 counter staff were helping a couple of the passengers at the counter. 

He told us to use the self-help kiosk computer even though we said we needed help with changing the seats. The computer did not do the latter and directed back to the counter. 

The guard was still reluctant and finally allowed my wife and I in the queue. However, our tour manager and the couple were kept outside the line even though they had legitimate business to speak to someone at the counter. 

There was a couple talking to a group of the staff outside the counter near the queue and the man was gesticulating wildly in a heated discussion with the staff. Eventually one of the staff involved in the 'conversation' told the guard to admit all of us and 'royally allowed' us to talk to him behind the counter. 

He told us in no uncertain terms that we were given our seats as 'non-paying' passengers and it was tough luck that we had to be separated. Our tour manager protested that the tour passenger list with familial/partnering connections was given to the airline beforehand but he said we were given a block of seats from rows 81 to 83 and he could not help in any way.
 
My question to the airline is this: if the passenger list has been provided with the different familial/partnering groupings could it not be more accommodating and doing a slipshod job of seating willy nilly without regard for the families and couples travelling together. What happens if there are families with young children? Furthermore if the airline has given a block of seats (say rows 61 to 63 or 81 to 83 and not all window seats or not all middle seats) in advance why can't it have the good sense to pass them on the tour manager beforehand so the tour manager can help to allocate the seats according to the passengers' preference and needs? Even in times of profit squeeze when corporations try to extract every cent from its passengers, how much money can you make to justify discriminating/alienating your passengers just because the 25 of them are travelling as part of a package tour? Would it make more sense to block up say 3 rows of seats when the tour company has booked and confirmed with the airline if the tour is going ahead (package tours are usually confirmed 2 weeks ahead of departure). Why make packaged tour passengers scramble for seats and create all that unhappiness for them against the airline?

I am really disappointed with Emirates as I used to fly Emirates between Australia and Singapore. As much I deem its cabin crew to be on par with the best in the industry, its booking and check in handling do leave such a bad taste that I feel like a sub passenger to want to boycott the airline."

We had never flown on Emirates but decided to give them a try over American or Delta. The numerous tv commercials with actress Penelope Cruz has subliminally triggered something that inspired me to convince my wife and friends that we should give them a try. At the time of our """"economy"""" booking we decided to pay an additional $410 per couple for seat upgrades. We had opted to pay more for the 2 seats together rather than the sitting in a row of three or fours seat in the center of the plane. As soon as we boarded the plane and took our seats I knew the outbound flight was going to be torture. The 2 seats that we paid $205 extra for were so small with walled sides and hand rests that didn't move would have been great if we were all contortionists but unfortunately we were not. We made it to Athens 10 hours later and after a couple of good nights sleep we put this horrible memory behind us so as not to ruin our 2 week long awaited vacation. About a week into the trip we did some research on the web and decided to downgrade our return seats from the same mini seats that we flew out on and instead opted for the standard seats that were in the middle section of the plane that included 4 seats. This was a great move as our return flight was much more comfortable. When I contacted Emirates upon our arrival and asked to get back the $205 paid for the return downgraded seats, their reply was that they do not issue refunds for seat downgrades!! What a rip off!! That said, the 4 of us will never travel on Emirates Air again. As a postscript I want to mention that none of the 4 our us, all retired and in our late 60's are heavy or have large behinds, to the contrary, we are all smaller individuals who have never had any comparable torturous seats while flying anywhere in the world. Unless you are Penolope Cruz and get complimentary """"first class"""" seating or opt to pay the additional thousands of dollars, PLEASE TELL YOUR FRIENDS TO STAY AWAY FROM EMIRATES AIRLINES."

We have travelled with Emirates before and although little expensive than the other airlines, we wanted to travel Emirates again this time as it was going to be a long flight and we were travelling with our baby. Unfortunately our flight experience was the worst ever. To start with, our baby was not given a cot despite the fact that we confirmed this twice in writing from the airline, they failed to mention that the height of the baby will affect this and due to the safety instructions- had they said that,, we would have bought a seat for the baby! Our baby was also not given any meal in flight on the way to Delhi. When asked staff was very rude and almost intimidating. The manager offered to allow us to buy a seat in first class for another ¬£2200 ! We had already spend ¬£4500 for this flight which is considerably way more in comparison to the other airlines but we wanted the Emirates experience. People like us, can't manage another ¬£2200 on the spot where we had to save for months for the fair we paid. So, me and my wife gave our seats for the baby to sleep and were standing for a good part of the flight. My wife suffers from a really bad Back and we were travelling to get her treated. She couldn't stand up any longer so decided to lay down on the floor in front of the baby seats. One of the staff member then came and got her up being very rude saying this is not allowed and it is very unsafe. My wife was very pleasant in responding and explained to the staff member that she has a really bad back and can not stand up any longer. She was finally taken to the back of the airplane and was offered to lay on the floor (in the kitchen area) and having no other choice My wife agreed and laid there while the flight crew was eating their food. How disgusting and inconsiderate was this? They clearly had seats in the first class which were empty but my wife had to lay on the floor. Anyway that only lasted 20 mins as the staff were to get ready for their next meal service. We were hating every minute of that flight! And would NEVER travel or RECOMMEND ANYONE to travel Emirates! Not worst wasting your hard earned money. The service is not as good as it used to be. Its all about the money these days! They don't care about their passengers!"

At Rio de Janeiro Airport, an Emirates representative approached me to inform me that they had lost my luggage and attempted to have me sign a release of liability, which I refused. They instructed me to file a complaint about my luggage in Buenos Aires. When I arrived in Buenos Aires on September 25th at 20:40, I approached Emirates, and after several rejections of my complaint, where they claimed, """"we didn't lose your luggage, it was lost on Copa,"""" they reluctantly accepted my complaint as a """"courtesy."""" It is important to note that the tickets were purchased in the name of Emirates, and that's how they appear with Emirates' codes on both tickets from Panama, Brazil to Buenos Aires.

On September 28th at 12:30, after several days of complete inaction, during which they promised me daily that I would receive an email and tracking information that never arrived, finally, my suitcases were delivered to my address via a shipping company that works with Emirates. I confirmed at my home that indeed some items were stolen, the loss amounts to more than $1,000. I have not received any response, and there has been complete silence from the airline.

They boast of being a renowned company, but from the moment they lost my luggage, they knew it would be stolen. They attempted to make me sign that disgraceful liability release document. They refused to take my complaint and did nothing but cover everything up.

They are the worst company I have ever traveled with. When I went to the police, they told me that everything that the customer service had indicated on WhatsApp was false, that they should have taken my complaint from the very beginning and not claim it was a """"courtesy."""" All they did was give me the runaround to waste my time. There is an international agreement that governs that you should take care of luggage from the very beginning to the end.

They did everything to absolve yourselves and give me the runaround. Their policies are appalling and shameful.

This is the only message that I've received form them:

""""Good evening, we confirmed that the weight of the checked luggage remained the same as when it arrived, so it will not be possible to make a claim. You can contact customer.affairs@emirates.com for any other complaints; this email is the central luggage complaints department.""""

What they just told me is so impossible that when I received the suitcases, I could carry them without any problems, but when I sent them, I could barely lift them.

The police at the airport specifically told me that there is an international agreement where they should take care of my luggage until it reaches my home. If the delivery drivers stole it, they should take responsibility and stop lying and going in circles.

Look at the company's total unethical behavior:

From minute one they tried to make me sign the waiver of liability.

Then they tried to deny my claim and used the term """"courtesy"""", when they know well about the Montreal agreement but they wanted to fool me from the beginning.

Then they deceitfully told me that I should go to the airport police. The police told me that nothing about the procedure they handled was honest, the report should be made where I confirmed the theft. They made me go to the airport that is an hour from where I live for nothing.

Today they invent the weight thing and even if it were true it means that the robbery occurred between the airport and my house, in any of the circumstances they must take charge. But they won't do it because the interest is to spin around until I get tired but believe me that's not going to happen.

Thank you for showing me that the name and recognition of a company are nothing in the face of a lack of ethics."

The flight was canceled less than 24 hours in advance, which severely impacted my long-haul trip. This trip was booked through the Emirates website and was disrupted just hours before its departure due to the cited 'unforeseen circumstances,' namely a fire incident at Catania Airport, which had occurred three weeks prior.

Being an aware passenger, I was cognizant of the previous flight cancellations to Catania and the airport's incapacity to handle extra-Schengen flights. Consequently, I had been diligently monitoring the situation, investing significant time and financial resources from a remote location in South Africa to stay updated and explore alternative travel options in case of an eventual cancellation.

My distressing experience began when I found myself caught in a bureaucratic game of ping-pong between Emirates and Flydubai, the airline operating the flight. Both carriers appeared to evade responsibility and failed to offer me any practical alternative plans. The cancellation notification reached me while I was en route to the airport, necessitating an unscheduled stop in an area with phone reception to contact the Emirates call center, as per Flydubai's app recommendation.

To my dismay, I spent over 30 minutes on the phone only to discover that Emirates was not presenting any viable options for reaching my final destination. Furthermore, their communication regarding alternative flights from Dubai to Italy was initially unclear‚Äîmentioning Rome or Milan‚Äîand later, limited to Naples, with no apparent connection to Catania. It was only after a protracted discussion that the call-center operator finally intervened, reconfiguring my entire reservation to a flight bound for Milan, just an hour before my scheduled check-in at Skukuza.

This change, which was seemingly necessitated by Emirates' arcane policies, left me in Dubai without compensation for the additional time spent there. I was accommodated in a shared room with no meals, a circumstance that I managed to secure solely because my partner already had a reservation for a Dubai Connect service. Following the call-center operator's instructions, I had to personally book a new flight from Milan to Catania, incurring additional expenses.

The overwhelming stress and uncertainty surrounding this ordeal marred a significant portion of my holiday experience. Furthermore, it resulted in illness, causing me to miss an essential medical appointment scheduled in Catania on August 7th. This entire episode proved to be nightmarish and deeply disappointing, an outcome I never anticipated from a company of Emirates' stature.

I respectfully requested that Emirates recognized the hardships I endured during this journey, including the extra costs incurred due to the days of delay and the missed medical appointment. However, they just said they could do nothing...

4.84884071350098,5.76640748977661,"Airline Cabin Service",3,"On the outbound journey (EK160), the cabin crew were both slow and unstructured, there was a lack of welcoming smiles and we even got to sit at the very back of row 47 without anyone welcoming us with a small hello - fine, perhaps many will say, but NO, that does not measure up and it does not correspond to the expectations and many previous experiences, nor to the price level. I didn't take the exact time, but we were served the first meal (dinner) until long after those in the second """"aisle"""" (on the opposite side of us) had already finished eating and cleared away their rubbish - We were also not asked if we wanted something to drink with the meal, coffee was probably served afterwards - but I didn't hear anything about that since I put on my headphones and closed my eyes after finally having dinner. In the last few years, the rolls have shrunk to ridiculously small and hard """"lumps"""" - most people who fly a lot know that it is difficult to make food taste as good in the air as it does on the ground, but how difficult can it really be serving a soft and suitably large roll...? It will certainly be noticed in a very positive way and may not be that expensive. 

Both meals on the outbound journey were served without a pleasant gesture or even with a small smile, on the contrary it appeared that the person (persons) in question had a very bad day at work. The last meal came a little """"faster"""", but still so slowly that they almost didn't have time to clean it up and collect garbage before we were to be prepared for landing - I was given 2 small cans of Pepsi Light to drink at my own request, and I refused coffee just before midnight - we were actually happy that we were going to land almost immediately, because my better half's entertainment screen stopped working approx. 30 min. before landing. It went totally black and stayed black‚Ä¶!!!

The journey home, on the other hand, was totally different, we were greeted with many smiles which we are usually used to from Emirates employees and served breakfast in what seemed to us to be very structured forms and in a way that meant that everyone got the food so quickly and efficiently that """"all of us"""" at one point sat and ate, before they just as efficiently cleaned the cabin and dimmed the lights since it was an early flight so many naturally wanted to sleep a little longer. The breakfast was tasty and decent enough, the lunch tasted good, but the consistency of the vegetables was, to put it mildly, overcooked, they could almost be enjoyed with a straw (sat a bit on the edge) - but it was tasty anyway, and no one had to wait until """"everyone else"""" was done with eating, before they got their food - as I said, this crew had full control of their serving - not least they were smiling in the middle of all the efficiency - so we would like to extend a big thank you to the cabin crew on EK159 (especially those in the rear cabin) on our return journey on the second last Saturday in September. 

We have been partially disappointed sometimes in the last 2 years and we have blamed it on the pandemic, but now we miss Emirates as we have experienced them so many times before. We still recommend Emirates to friends and family, but it is for now an unproven option that exists, and we have been advised several times to test this as a stopover to other places in Southeast Asia. So much time has passed since the pandemic now - that we, the passengers, should be able to expect that flights and service will be normalized. If the new normal remains as it is now, we will probably also ‚Äúbe forced‚Äù to find alternatives to OSL_DXB in the future. We want to avoid any irritation with entertainment systems (equipment such as screens) and other things that don't work or even stop working in flight - We always pay for very expensive 2-seater rows (compared to some other) and sometimes have to be moved to even worse seat choices than we have paid for - because of broken things - in addition, very annoying to say the least. We have experienced that Emirates aircraft on routes other than the one from OSL to DXB seem better maintained, but we have not kept any statistics or records on this - that is how we generally perceive the aircraft. We obviously hope that the next trip will be successful, if not enough alternatives will be explored."

The check-in process at Dubai Airport was frustrating from the beginning due to two out of service self-check-in machine that caused delays. When I asked an Emirates staff member for help, they told me to leave my baggage on the left side of the counter and said it would be taken care of manually.

However, the most frustrating part of my experience happened after I arrived in Beirut. I found out that my baggage wasn't loaded onto the flight, which was very inconvenient as it had important things I needed for my stay. Even though I followed the instructions from Emirates staff at Dubai Airport, my baggage wasn't handled properly.

What made things worse was that I sent two emails to Emirates customer service to report the issue and ask for help, but I didn't get any response.

To add to my frustration, I want to emphasize that I am still waiting for my baggage to be returned to me. This whole situation has been very disappointing because I feel like I haven't been getting the help I needed. It's frustrating when a well-known airline like Emirates doesn't respond promptly and effectively to customer problems.

The person operating the wheelchair was not nice at all and he kicked my mom in her back when she was at the checking room. Im not sure if he did that in a purpose or it was an accident. Even if that was an accident he does not know how to operate a wheelchair. My mom at that moment felt very upset and started crying and said in her language: why are you kicking me. He did not care at all. I was waiting at the door at terminal 3 arrival and they came outside. I went and said thank to him and he was rudely standing and waiting for a tip. I didn't know that I should tip him untill he mention that he needs a tip. He also complained about that he had to push her and her baggage to go for inspection. I think he could easily got help from someone. At that moment I wasn't aware of the incident and tipped him 20 dollars. When we get home and my mom told me about what happened I got very upset and thought that I need to report him. This is not the way of respectfully taking care of an elderly that came to US as a visitor. I paid almost 1500 for her ticket and the wheelchair service must be perfect.

I would like to contact such a service. It‚Äôs nice when a company puts customer cases above any regulations and understands each client individually. This is very rare, especially in large companies. Thank you Noar Sheikh, thank you Emirates!

2.67087650299072,4.25981473922729,"Emirates Flight Delays",1,"We booked our first family trip to Dubai through Emirates. We were excited to experience not only the destination but the flight because we had never flew with Emirates and were expecting a bit of luxury.
We couldn't be further from the truth. We boarded the plane, seats weren't as roomy or luxury as expected although the entertainment system seemed OK. The plane moved about 10 metres but there was a strange noise coming from the engine. We were told the plane malfunctioned so awaited an engineer.  We sat on the plane for 6 hours while they tried to fix it. In all that time we were offered water and a croissant. Staff were miserable and rude- obviously looking annoyed that their shift had been extended. Finally, we were told to disembark the plane as they couldn't fix it and were asked to collect our luggage and join a huge check in queue again. After waiting on the queue we were told that we had been booked on a flight 24 hours later from Manchester (3 hour bus journey). We were advised to call Emirates to see if we could book onto an earlier flight but staff did not know what the number would be. So I googled the number, gave them a call and was told they couldn't help as we booked the holiday as a package holiday so needed to call Emirates holidays instead. However, Emirates holidays staff don't work out of hours so had to stick with the allocated flight. Not sure why it had to be do complicated. We were advised buses had been booked and would arrive in 20 minutes. So everyone went and waited outside the airport for these buses. We waited and waited. Staff (if you could find one as they kept disappearing) kept saying they would be 10 minutes. 2 hours later waiting outside they finally arrived. We started our long journey to Manchester. At this point, still only had been offered the shot size glass of water and croissant. We arrived at Manchester 2.30am in the morning and were told if we wanted breakfast we had to get up at 7am-8am as breakfast closed at 8am. So, sleep deprived and with children, we got up had breakfast and boarded the bus to airport at 9am. We arrived at the airport, no food vouchers were on offer. We arrived at Dubai over 24 hours later than we should have. But because of the extra travel and minimal sleep, it was more 48 hours we lost out on.
If that wasn't bad enough, when we complained to Emirates holidays about our delay and experience we were told they wouldn't take responsibility and to contact Emirates instead. Although Emirates provided the compulsory compensation for the delayed flight, they would not comment on my full complaint of missing out on paid accommodation and half board meals, poor customer service both on the plane and on the ground, extra airport expenses, and the significant changes to the holiday. So they passed me back to Emirates Holidays. Emirates holidays regused to answer my complaint in full. I requested a refund for the losses above but was told we werent entitled to it and would not address all the points raised, even when I asked for it to be escalated to a manager. They said the standard flight delay compensation is all they offer and try and claim through my holiday insurance instead. The customer service has been the worst we have experienced across all airlines we have flown with. We have had 100% better service and comfort with budget airlines. When I speak to other people who have experienced similar with UK based travel companies, they have been refunded their flight and lost accommodation expenses. I am shocked a company the size of Emirates Holidays would refuse to address a complaint in full. We were so looking forward to our first Emirates experience but this has put us off booking with Emirates Holidays again. If you need to fly with Emirates, do not book a package holiday with Emirates Holidays as if something goes wrong their complaints team are not fit for purpose."

5.42933940887451,8.97932529449463,"Emirates Air Travel",5,"While our ticket was a bit pricey, I think the onboard experience was great.

Both of our flights were aboard Emirates' 777s. We had older aircraft for both  of our flights (delivered around 2008), so the cabin did feel a bit dated, especially with the IFEs. While it was disappointing to see these aircraft still in service without refurbishment, it is understandable, since the airline's 777X deliveries have been pushed back by 5 years, so these aircraft were likely going to be retired.

The seats on the 777 are quite narrow in a 3-4-3 configuration. I found the legroom to be OK, but the width was definitely uncomfortable, although standard on most 777s today. The IFE was not very responsive and did seem to have a more limited selection than what I saw on their website (unless I didn't look properly), but it still worked, and there were many options to watch.
¬†
However, Emirates really made up for this with their soft product. All crew aboard our flights were extremely friendly and attentive. There were drink services throughout the flight. The meal services really were impressive though for economy. They tasted great, and were very generous with portions, with great presentation. These meals left me full the whole flight, and I ended up not getting any food at Dubai Airport during my connection, since the first meal was so good.

Speaking of Dubai connections, the experience was very smooth. Took only about 5 minutes from getting off the plane to being in departures, as security lines, despite being busy, moved very fast. No need to remove electronics or water when we went through.

Overall, while the seats felt old (older than the ones I had flown on back in 2013), they were still good, and I think the soft product was amazing. I definitely enjoyed these flights, and would consider booking again when travelling long haul (especially once their new A350s and 777Xs start being delivered).

One tip to travellers booking, you can usually tell if you'll be on an older 777-300ER by checking the aircraft registrations in the flight history on flightradar24. Aircrafts with registrations A6-EB, A6-EC, and A6-EG until EGP have the older cabin. 
For example, on my second flight, (EK193), if I go to flightradar24, it shows that most of the registrations of aircraft that operated this route in the past week are A6-EC.

Coming home, it  was quite the reverse. The staff were disorganised, drinks were not offered regularly and staff forgot them on two occasions. Attendants used the extra legroom area in front of our seats to chat and gathered with as many as 6 right in front of our seats. Our additional legroom was not usable as staff used the area both to gather and to move trolleys. My feet (shoes removed for comfort) were stepped upon. This resulted in us tucking them away, negating any benefit to extra legroom and offering less freedom to move our legs than in a standard seat. We mentioned this to staff but it continued. Having travelled with Emirates in the past, we were expecting better."

I have been using Emirates' services for over 20 years, being a Blue member and, then, a Silver member, up until the time of covid. I have had no reason to complain, previously about Emirates‚Äô service.
Sitting in seat 30F, I had ordered vegetarian food, and received a snack soon after take-off, along with a sealed cup of water. Subsequently, meals for other passengers were brought round and people were offered drinks, but I was offered nothing, and the steward moved on too quickly for me to request a drink. 
At the next opportunity, when a steward passed by, I requested a drink, but was advised to wait until lunch was served (a very poor response, I felt). I reiterated: I would like a drink as soon as possible (as I was thirsty). The person in seat 30G was asleep and i could not exit the seat with causing a disturbance. A drink was subsequently provided (but over 15 minutes later). However, the table in 30F is/was not secure and the drink slid off, spilled over me and the person in 30G next to me. The people sitting either side of me were more helpful than the steward in trying to clear up the mess. 
Later on, lunch did arrive, but it was 2 hours after I had first requested a drink (so, my request for a drink had been vindicated). When food trays were later collected, mine was overlooked, the steward passed me by, and my food tray was left for over half an hour. When a steward passed by, I asked that the tray be removed and could not understand why I was being treated in what seemed a negligent manner. At this point, I was beginning to become very fed up.
A supervisor later came round and asked if I was alright. I was fine (albeit tired), but frustrated at having been ignored and overlooked. The supervisor was firm, but unapologetic, and asked me if i needed anything. I did not need anything, and she left me without further comment, her enquiry appearing pointless to me, as it solved nothing.
 Following this experience, I am unlikely to use Emirates again, which has left me thoroughly disillusioned with the company."

We fly with emirates on the basis of the service and flight attendants providing an experience to remember. My daughter insisted we take emirates flight to Dubai as she enjoys the trips on the flight. Based on our recent travel, We may not use this airline anymore. There is a particular flight attendant ‚ÄòAnton‚Äô who really needs to work on how to deal with people. This individual is rude and needs training on how to speak to people. There are no morals and understanding an individual or requirements. My daughter tried resting on the seats which was empty in the front. ‚ÄòAnton‚Äô approached us demanding we return back to our seats. I stated the seats are empty and I wanted my daughter to rest as the leg room is slightly spacious at the front. I understand if the front was occupied however I advised the flight attendant that I tried booking these seats and I was unable to do so. He advised if you want your daughter to rest here, it will cost an additional $152 which is quite confusing as we were in the air 4 hours away from our destination. I stated previously we travelled on October 2022 and we was able to rest in the empty seats in the front without any further expenses, he advised we are unable to change seats and the rules changed a year ago? Either he just started or he clearly does not know what his talking about. Nether the less we did not want to debate with the attendant and moved back to our seat. My daughter was shocked and said to me she doesn‚Äôt like this airline anymore. Previous people were kind and not as rude as ‚ÄòAnton‚Äô. People who use there airline have built the reputation for them through the service and recommendations. They don‚Äôt care about the public or the service anymore."

Food was mediocre, I do not believe that """"plane food"""" is an excuse as I genuinely enjoy my meals on British Airways.

The worst was the ground staff in Dubai. We got denied boarding on our layover flight due to overbooking, and the supervisor there had the professionalism of a teenager working the cash register in your local shop. He had the audacity to roll his eyes at us as if my 12 hour delay was an inconvenience to HIM. He did not even ask for the tickets when sorting us out, he didn't even look my way and just made that hand gesture for """"hand them over"""". I have never seen service fractionally this abysmal even on budget airlines. You would be delusional to expect an ounce of politeness from Emirates staff even at their headquarters airport.

6.65704870223999,9.71985626220703,"Emirates Air Travel",3,"Some good some bad very inconsistent

The good :

My husband and I flew economy Brisbane/Dubai/Rome (paid extra for side twin seats which was worthwhile for extra aisle space and no third person seat).

Unfortunately there were no twin seats left on the return flights to pay extra for :( though the Rome/Dubai seating seemed more roomy than the Dubai/Brisbane flight (A380 vs B777).

The cabin crew were generally very professional, polite and helpful - particularly the very friendly staff on the Dubai/Rome and Dubai/Brisbane flights.

The food provided was very reasonable for airline food and plentiful.

The toilets were generally kept stocked and clean which was good particularly on the 15 hour flights between Brisbane and Dubai !

Dubai airport is very big with light rail travel between terminals for connecting flights which is good.

Not good :

The headphones supplied onboard are very poorly fitting and uncomfortable. For some reason, the headphones are rectangular and bulky - rather than oval - so they don't fit at all and keep slipping off which makes it very difficult to listen to in-flight movies. I reported to using closed captions where available but not all movies have this option either.

Dubai airport and security were disappointing (the following is noted relating to Emirates airline review as Dubai airport is their home airport).

Dubai is a silent airport so no announcements are made and you are responsible for checking your flight status, terminal, gate etc however there aren't always Departure boards easily located in some areas or clocks (to check you've got the local time right).

Airport food and drinks are very expensive - it's expected that you'll pay more at an airport however milk coffees, soft drinks and water from cafes, market shops and even vending machines were AED25 - 30 (AUD11 - 13) as well as food.

The condition of some airport facilities and toilets was not great - for cleanliness or wear and tear.

For some reason, although we were within the secure area of the airport at all times (ie for connecting flights only) and had boarding passes for our flights from Dubai issued at check-in at Brisbane and Rome, we had to show our passports multiple times at the gate for flights - on the Dubai/Brisbane flight we had to show our passport to 2 different people who were 3 metres apart at the boarding gate ?

We also had unopened bottles of water confiscated after going through the boarding gate and downstairs to board the plane for the Dubai/Brisbane flight where we were all stopped to have our carryon bags searched - as did most people -however once on the plane, we saw a woman in front of us had a bottle of water sticking from her backpack pocket plus a 1/3 full bottle of juice from the other pocket ? A woman sitting near us on the plane was also drinking water from multiple metal water bottles she brought on the plane.

No explanation was given for why most of us had our unopened bottles of water - purchased at exorbitant prices from the airport cafes or market shops in the secure area for a 15 hour flight - confiscated at the last moment prior to boarding the flight and with no prior warning this would happen.

We had carried water bottles on to 3 previous Emirates flights on this trip with no issue - including Dubai to Rome 11 days earlier !

Our duty free alcohol was also taken at this same point- as was everyone else's - and we were told we would get it back in Brisbane but not where to collect it. 

This was all very chaotic as none of us knew why and had no previous warning or advice about the water or duty free to fly from Dubai on may this flight not the others. 

We had bought the duty free alcohol at Rome airport and had flown Rome to Dubai on Emirates with it in our carry-on bags as we did with water bottles.

This all made boarding the Dubai to Brisbane flight very chaotic, rushed and confusing for many of us due to the lack of information and the inconsistency shown by Dubai airport and/or Emirates ground staff !

For this reason, we will avoid flying with Emirates in future and avoid flights going through Dubai airport."

Past this was Ahmed who was the supervisor that was clearly not in control and all three acted as if they were superior to all. Lastly there was a group of 10 passengers who i personally had no issue with but they had consumed so much alcohol on the flight they had become raucous and rowdy with one of them climbing over chairs mid flight.

It was the first time using them (my Company positioned me back home) and I was really curious to see if their good reputation as a 5 star Airline was about to be proved. But NO. The flight was a very basic, far below the B/C standards of a 5 star airline. The Crew services were not the ones you should have normally expected, rushing to do their job, not paying enough attention to the Guests‚Äô needs, the drink selection was poor and the meal options disgraceful. You had to wait a lot for a refill of your Champagne fl√ªte and for me not wanting to bother the crew (I myself am a VIP F/A on a Private Jet), I took mine and a Lady‚Äôs next to me fl√ªtes and went to the Galley and very politely and discreetly asked the Crew for a refill of the drinks (I explained with a big smile that I didn‚Äôt want to bother them and I would have been more than happy to bring them back to our seats myself). One of the crew who informed me that he was about to be promoted to the First Class shortly, told me in a borderline arrogant way that he would bring them back to our seats himself, because the Champagne SHOULD  be poured in the Cabin. Fair enough it‚Äôs a part of the Service, but I found it significantly impolite to be kinda told off like this. I perfectly know the Service Etiquette and I just wanted to be helpful. 

First Course was called Light Bites and it was a totally poor option. Breakfast was not even up to ANY B/C standards. A very quick service like they wanted to just finish and that‚Äôs it.

None of the Crew ever let us know that we should have become a member of their Loyalty program first, so as for us to be able to get a complimentary WiFi throughout the 9 hour flight. So NO WiFi.

Now, I would have never expected me to say that, but on my positioning flight  from London Heathrow to Boston last week on a JetBlue B/C A321 Neo, the experience was superb. Fantastic indeed. Amazing and attentive Crew, a super organized and efficient B/C Service and an unbeatable, quicker than a Ray of light WiFi connection starting on ground. Very well done to JetBlue.

I should have read the instructions but I am frequent flier and I have never encountered such a rigid regime where they refuse to make exceptions and be understandable about a student‚Äôs situation. 

Anyhow, I agreed to pay the amount for the extra weight and got another shcoker that they only accept card or cash. For someone like me who is leaving the country for good few years, it's a possibility to not to carry any card and also not to carry such heavy indian currency. Luckily I had an old credit card (which I wasn't sure will work but it did) and paid amount. The staff on the counter where they were taking payments was so impolite. 

On top of that, they checked our boarding passes more six times. It left me feeling like a militant. Even after clearing the security check-in they had another counter before boarding where they were randomly calling people to open up their bags. So overall it's a shitru start and I am never going to book emirates again or recommend just because they are fancy doesn't mean they are good. One star from me!!"

The Cons:  The passenger in the front seat who insisted in reclining his seat soon after lift off.  There should be some rules about this behaviour! The connecting flight EK 448 to Auckland had a small child whose mother expected the crew to look after and let her run up and down the aisles for hours, annoying other passengers,  this despite the crew bringing the child back numerous times to the mother and telling her to keep her child under control.  Clearly, this fell on deaf ears with the mother ignoring this directive from the crew.  I felt so sorry for the crew who had to babysit the child for nearly all the duration of the 15h.45 m flight.  I don't think I would have shown such patience as the crew did in such dire circumstances."

I called again that afternoon - the consultant said he thinks my suitcase is lost and that I should start thinking about compensation. I told him about the email I received on Day 13 saying it has been located in Singapore and requested, and that I would be contacted for further details, which did not happen at all. Then this particular consultant put me on hold for a long time. When he came back, he said he called Singapore Airport (!!!) and that my suitcase was, in fact, onboard EK355 flight going from SIN to DXB (!!!) arriving tomorrow Tuesday at midnight and it was to go on the EK161 from DXB to DUB arriving that same day at midday. All this time the other consultants said there was no phone to contact the Baggage Services at airports üôÑ

Then I told him I was going to DXB on the EK162 flight at 14:15 on Tuesday and asked him to not send it to DUB. He put me on hold again to call the airport, but said there was no answer, so he said he would send HIGH PRIORITY emails to the relevant airports. He said I would be contacted about the update on my suitcase, but I received none.

At 11pm that night, I called again, worried about my suitcase. I spoke to someone called Nicky, who said there was no response yet from the airports, she tried to call (!!!) but no answer, so she sent another HIGH PRIORITY emails. She said there were 5 hours before the flight to DUB and the email is checked often enough, therefore, they should be able to intercept the process. She was very confident of this!

Day 30
I had to get up at 5am to catch the 7am train to get the airport, which took 2 hours, then another half hour bus ride. At this time, still no contact from Emirates (what a surprise!). During the train journey, I contacted Emirates 3x.
  1. Lailo - this consultant said there had been no response from the airports and she was confused because according to the PIR, my bag was """"still tracing."""" She sent another HIGH PRIORITY emails and said it would take DXB within 2 hours to respond.
  2. Nicky (may not be the same one as the one the night before as she didn't seem familiar with my case) - she said no response from the airports and wanted to check with her colleague that told me about my suitcase being onboard a flight, then was going to call me back. She did indeed call me back a while later, but that was after I had spoken to Dublin Airport staff.
  3. Farheem - he doesn't think this was my suitcase as the PIR said it was """"still tracing"""", but if it was, he believed it was onboard EK161 on the way to Dublin. He suggested I check with the airport staff when I check-in for my flight to Dubai.

At Dublin Airport, I went up to an Emirates staff member, Rima, who seemed familiar with my case as she saw """"some emails."""" She took me to a small office near the check-in desks and referred me to a Senior Officer, Megumi. Megumi made some phone calls and it was confirmed that one of the rush bags onboard of EK161 was my suitcase ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è She asked for it to be a HIGH PRIORITY to come out ASAP so she can transfer it to my flight. She said there was 70% chance she could do it, but if it doesn't happen, it would be on the next flight, the EK164. I gave them a description of my suitcase and, at the boarding gate, Rima confirmed Megumi had my suitcase and was on her way to put it onto the plane. Rima said she would confirm with me the details, but by the time the plane doors closed, I didn't see her again.

I asked the Team Leader onboard EK162 and she wasn't aware of any rush bags on this plane, but she said it will usually be sent to the delivery address on file (my hotel).

Day 31
When I arrived at DXB after midnight, I went up to Malek, an Emirates staff member and told him about my case. He said the bag would come out on belt 2, the same belt where the EK162 passengers' bags would come out. That morning, I was disappointed (again), when it didn't come out. He sent an email to Dublin to make sure it is on the next flight, said my hotel will be called (as we don't have a mobile number to contact anymore), and the suitcase will be sent there.

We went to bed at 3:30 that morning and before we did, my husband noticed an email from Megumi saying """"time was against us"""", she didn't manage to put the bag on my flight, but they will send it to DXB on EK164, set to leave at 10pm Dublin time that night.
 
EK164 arrived at 8am Dubai time that morning, but by 10:30, I had not received any update. I wasn't able to respond to Megumi's email until then and I told her I was still waiting for my suitcase. She said she spoke to her colleague on duty and was told it did not board the EK164 ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and that it was still in Dublin. She didn't explain why and said she was off duty that day, but will speak to her colleague on duty and update me. She emailed me that afternoon to confirm the suitcase was put on the EK162 flight and would arrive at midnight 10th August.

She may not supposed to be on her work emails during non-work hours, but she was the only one bothered to make the efforts and update me with progress. She showed me compassion and seems to be the only on reliable and responsible enough so far.

By this day, I was naturally RAGING!

Day 32
Suitcase was already at my hotel by the time I woke up. Happy Ever After!

Day 34 - my flight home ü§£
When I discussed compensation at Dubai Airport, they said they can only offer US$150 for Interim Relief, which I called BULL. My suitcase was delayed for OVER 31 days and I spent almost US$500 on items that I would not have needes if I had my suitcase! Also, the staff at Dublin Airport clearly told me compensation is US$50/day that our baggage is delayed. Then the staff at Dubai Airport told me to contact Customer Affairs to dispute this.

It has been 4wks since I came home and I am STILL dealing with Customer Affairs about compensation. I also asked for the investigation report of what happened to my suitcase, why there was a delay sending it to me, AND why the delay happened despite my repeated attempts to make sure it stays in Dubai!!! They responded 3x during this month  - 1. To apologise and assure me that it was an isolated incidence, but then had the cheek to ask why my receipts were in different currencies üôÑ, 2. (A week after the first one) A one line saying my claim is under review, 3. (2 weeks after the second one) A one line saying my claim is under review and is at its final stage.
My questions and request for the investigation report were blatantly ignored. I had sent 10+ emails asking them to address my request and questions, even called the helpline several times. All they could do was send an email and ask me to fill in a follow-up (complaint) form - which will take 15-30 days for a response ü§£

I was worried the plane might depart DUB late as we only started boarding 35 minutes before scheduled departure. But credit to the staff we departed on time. The experience on board was really good: food was really enjoyable, staff were magnificent. 
BUT the ICE experience left a lot to be desired, which I will reflect in more detail below. Under ‚Äòlive Tv‚Äô I expected upon tapping on BBC to get live feed. What I got was a stuttering bulletin from the channel. On the plus side I must say the choice of music was 100%.

From Dubai to Cape Town: this wasn‚Äôt as good experience as the first leg. I found the seats a bit more cramped. Also had problems with my ICE screen in front of my seat. The screen kept freezing.

DXB to CPT is a 9 hour flight and the experience felt as though I couldn‚Äôt land in CPT fast enough to get off the plane. 
Real pity as the first leg was exceptionally good whereas the 2nd leg was only ok.
I wanted to separate the flights as I wanted to award DUB-DXB a 5 but TA wont allow me to comment under Emirates again for a certain amount of time. I also wanted to report the  DXB airport experience separately but I cannot find a site for that. So I have condensed 3 reports into one, which is not fair in the points award eg: for value I wanted to award DUB-DXB a 5 whereas the 2nd leg only a average (3), so instead of 5 I can only award a 4."

1. Food was fantastic.  Appealing choices and plenty of it.  Only negative is that the trays are now smaller, meaning any additional drinks (e.g. wine) have to go on your seat tray, rather than the food tray, and slide off easily (first-hand experience).  
2. Drinks.  With the dry air of the 777, you must drink fluids to avoid the headaches.  Unfortunately, without continuously prompting, not enough water was offered, and when it was, it was provided by the cupfull, rather than a bottle - which, while environmentally negative, a bottle would last longer, and could be used throughout the flight - rather than multiple cups.
3. Service.  The flight was packed, and this impacted the attentiveness of the crew.  A number of times, they avoided eye contact, which was the first time I'd seen this happen.  Smiles appeared fake, and noticeable absence of any 'please' and 'thank you's' in any interaction - despite us going out of our way to be friendly and polite (a full flight is challenging for all).  Crew on the second flight were better, but still less enthusiastic than in previous years. Last thing - neither the captain nor the pursars PA announcements could be heard - far too fast and casual.  Strangely, first officer was clear.  Make of that what you will...
4. Seat.  Legroom was much better than I expected - at 180cm, I didn't expect to have 4-5 inches between my seat and the one in front.  This made a big difference and allowed you to stretch your legs.  Having said that, it's still very difficult to sleep with the noise of the engines (back of plane) and the shape of the seat.  Some can do it, but I can't.  
5. ICE etc.  The screen and offerings are brilliant.  There's something for everyone and the interface is great.  Couple of negatives - the headphones are awful - engine noise is unabated, and the headphones are uncomfortable. I assume they are disposed each flight as they are very cheaply made.  The solution is the take some bluetooth headphones - work perfectly.  The USB charging port was broken, so didn't work.
6. Passengers.  Not much Emirates can do about this, but certainly air travel brings out the best and worst of people.  Lovely kindness shows by others to help older folk, and those with kids.  Awful to see people take advantage of the cabin baggage rules.  How one person can almost fill an entire overhead bin with their oversized cabin baggage...!

She then informed us that we were not booked onto the flight which is strange cause first of all how did we get to Ireland in the first place and how did my partner book seats for the flight. Her answer to these questions were oh you flew for free from Auckland to Dublin and system error for being able to book seats. Emirates informed us that our bank revoked the payment for the flights originally so payment was never processed. I then proceded to show her that our bank took the payment out and never credited us back, they didnt contact us to say they revoked it so how would they know that. She then said the bank were trying to call us to inform us but that was a lie. So basically for us to fly back to NZ we had to pay for full flights again on a credit card.

We pressed the buzzer for a drink  They did not come we had to give up in the end. The food was awful I asked if they had any other flavour sandwiches for my child and was just told no. The staff are basically only bothered about 1st class and higher paying passengers. I wouldn‚Äôt mind but when I booked I wasn‚Äôt even given a choice of upgrades it was the front of the plane or nothing. They gave all the kids their meals first and never brought my child anything I told them and their reply was the Asian and vegetarian food is served 1st and then the rest. This was afternoon tea with sandwiches and a scone, there was nothing different about their food at all. I found this appalling!

I would especially like to thank Ran who was the supervisor on the flight.

He even noticed that my bags were not sturdy and gave me extra bags to put my things in.

In my opinion it was like flying Air Asia which was a nightmare and I still have a negative physical reaction to the thought of going on another Air Asia flight. 

It began at check-in. I was instructed to go to the business class line although I had an economy ticket. I checked my bag and was asked to weigh my carry-on luggage. It was overweight. I pre-paid for excess baggage but that did not apply to carry-on luggage. So, as I began to transfer items to another bag I was immediately told to hurry up because this was business class. I responded that you asked me to come to this line and I am not going to rush. The agent then told me I needed to get out of line and go to economy to finish check-in. I declined. I finished removing items from my bag to check it in along with the previous bag. This was first, but not last encounter with a rude employee. 

The second time was as I was boarding the flight. My boarding pass was checked to be sure I was in the right zone. Other passengers were not stopped and asked to verify zone. Not sure if that had to do with my skin color. Who knows?

The pilot had excellent communication about delays and arrival time. The legroom was pretty good and the plane seemed to be in good condition. 

Then we have the flight attendants. I want to give a shout out to the male attendants especially Miguel who were friendly, welcoming and warm. 

The female attendants who serviced economy rows 20-30+ on both sides of the aisle were ANGRY, RUDE and HATEFUL. The way they treated passengers were shocking. Closing bins that were not full, thereby, creating confusion and congestion as passengers looked for empty bins to store their luggage. Then moving peoples luggage from said bins and cramming them into bins farther down the aisle without even notifying the passengers. Rudely and impatiently talking to and responding to passengers. Rushing down the aisle violently bumping people with hips and carts without an apology...continuously. Then literally throwing food at us like we were pigs in a pin then angrily snatching up trays.

Being 1.93m tall, and even worse, having my longest dimension from my backside to my knees, I need reasonable legroom. I have travelled long distance for years on BA, but have always had to either get the legroom seats in cattle or go Premium cattle as their normal cattle are ridiculously short pitch. I therefore decided to try Emirates and travelled in the emergency exit seats on the 777 up to Dubai and then normal to London. While the seats are a bit narrow, I can't say I had too many problems in the latter on an A380. However, it's certainly worthwhile for me to pay for legroom if it's available.

The food is great - only complaint is there's too much but nothing that a few laps around London wouldn't fix. The stewardesses seem fine and reasonably friendly, but it IS economy class.

The one big issue? Dubai airport. I'll be doing an individual reveiw on that, but frankly, it's abysmal in one major respect. There aren't any travelators at all. Very painful when your plane is delayed in arriving at your initial airport to be prepared for your first leg and arrives in DBX forty minutes before your next one is due to leave when it should have been two hours. Fair enough, there were Emirates staff showing you the way, but to have to travel via bus then train to get to the next gate. It's ridiculous that even when your flight is on time that you still have to leg it seemingly from one side of the airport to the other! Not very impressed at all even though they held the London flight for me. Who the hell designs an airport like that?!"

I have been told that the airline staff is always super helpful when you travel with a baby but it is definitely not the experience I had. The air hostesses didn't come once during the 17h flight to ask if I was ok or needed anything. Same for the 7h flight from Dubai to Barcelona. When I pressed the button to ask for assistance the air hostess came 5-10min later to turn it off, thinking I pressed the button by mistake. It was mentioned I would get a baby meal and got offered one pouch only because I asked for it or 2h before landing. I was not offered any help with my bag and pram when boarding and leaving the plane and hadto ask for some. Luckily I had nice people sitting next to me so I could go to the toilet while they were keeping an eye on my baby as the staff didn't come once asking if they could help with anything.
I flew many times with Emirates in the past, before having a baby, and always had a great experience. I was really disappointed with their service this time. I am flying back to NZ in a week and hope that the staff will be more helpful but honestly don't have any expectation..."

Despite reporting the issue to Emirates staff at Dublin Airport, my concerns were met with minimal attention. The staff member appeared disinterested and frequently engaged with his phone. 
Only upon insisting did he start taking the matter seriously. This was the first instance of poor service. 

The staff assured us that our bags would be on the plane, but this proved untrue. Upon arrival in Dubai, my bag was still missing. I reported the situation to the baggage information desk, and an employee promised that my bag would arrive by 11 am the next day. No case number was provided, which hindered my ability to track progress. I had to personally request delivery of the bag to my hotel, a service that should have been standard. 

Over the next days, Emirates staff gave conflicting information. Some blamed Aer Lingus, while others claimed Emirates had located the luggage. This caused immense stress as I had a wedding to prepare for on July 31st. 

Upon contacting a senior supervisor she promised to escalate the matter and informed me of a $50/day allowance, which I could claim at Dubai Airport. She assured me that all calls were recorded and could serve as evidence. 

However, resolving the issue at Dubai Airport became another ordeal. I was shuffled between multiple desks in the early hours. Eventually, I reached the correct office, only to be informed that a refund could not be processed without a receipt. This requirement was never communicated during our previous phone calls. 

Despite having confirmation on my mobile banking app, Emirates staff rejected this evidence. They stated that the refund could only be claimed at Manchester Airport, even though I explained my travel plans to Oxford on the same day. 

No written communications were ever provided. Upon returning to Manchester, I sought the Emirates office, only to discover it no longer existed. 

The entire process has been incredibly stressful and falls far short of the service one would expect from a reputable company like Emirates. I repeatedly requested written email updates, but none were provided. 

Despite initially choosing Emirates for their reputed service, this experience has cast doubt on my future use of the airline."

It has come to our attention that Emirates Airlines has been canceling fully paid and confirmed seats without providing any prior notification to affected passengers. This unfortunate occurrence is a result of a technical glitch in their system. Regrettably, our confirmed seats were among those canceled by Emirates due to the aforementioned system fault. Consequently, we find ourselves in a stranded situation, with Emirates now requesting us to pay the full ticket price once again if we wish to secure new confirmed seats. It is worth noting that the available seats they are offering are in the economy premium class, whereas the seats we originally paid for and were subsequently canceled are in the economy flex class.

Allow me to provide further context. We diligently purchased return tickets and carefully selected our desired seats, believing that our travel plans were well-organized and secure. However, the unexpected cancellation of our confirmed seats by Emirates has left us disheartened and in a state of uncertainty.

Attention all prospective travelers considering Emirates Airlines for your upcoming trips, we would like to bring a recent issue to your attention. It has come to our notice that Emirates Airlines has been canceling fully paid and confirmed seats without providing any prior notification to affected passengers. This unfortunate situation has arisen due to a technical glitch within their system.

Regrettably, our own confirmed seats were among those canceled by Emirates Airlines due to the aforementioned system malfunction. Consequently, we find ourselves in a stranded situation, with Emirates now requesting us to pay the full ticket price once again if we wish to secure new confirmed seats. 

Allow me to provide further context. Initially, we purchased return tickets and carefully selected our desired seats, feeling assured that our travel plans were well-organized and secure. A few days later, while exploring options for a potential business upgrade, I innocently clicked on the upgrade button within the app but did not proceed any further and exited the application.

To our dismay, upon checking our selected seats after a few days, we discovered that our chosen seats had mysteriously disappeared.

We contacted the Emirates USA office to inquire about our seats and make seat selections. To our surprise, we were informed that our seats had been upgraded to business class, and seat selection would only be possible 48 hours before the flight.

Following this information, we proceeded with our departure flight to Pakistan. During our time there, I became curious about how our seats had been upgraded. Upon reviewing our itinerary, everything appeared to be in order, and all return flights were confirmed. However, when I reached out to customer service for clarification, I was informed that our seats had been canceled due to my previous click on the upgrade option. To secure new confirmed seats, they demanded a payment of $8,000 for economy class or $20,000 for business class.

I expressed my frustration, questioning how they could cancel our seats without our consent or any form of notification. The customer service representative simply stated that this was the procedure: if you click on the upgrade option but do not proceed with payment, your seats are automatically canceled. They further explained that since I had not made the payment, the business class seats were not reserved. I argued that by not making the payment, it should be understood that I did not wish to proceed with the upgrade. I found it unacceptable that they canceled our flight without any warning, consent, or notification, and yet they continued to insist on the $8,000 payment.

Subsequently, Emirates placed us on a waitlist and instructed us to check the flight status daily through their app. I had to continually contact them to determine whether our seats had been confirmed or not. It is truly disheartening to witness the greed displayed by Emirates in this situation. Despite the fact that the mistake was entirely theirs, they have shifted the blame and financial burden onto us.

In light of these circumstances, we have made the decision to book a flight with Qatar Airways instead, at a cost of only $8,000. Emirates, on the other hand, insisted on an additional $8,000 payment for our fully paid tickets, despite the fact that the cancellation was due to a glitch in their own system. Not only did they fail to offer us an apology, but they also had the audacity to demand more money from us. This behavior reflects poorly on Emirates, and they should be ashamed of themselves."

She is 82 years old and we were pleading to the gate agent for her to fly once in the UK I will explain the situation. 

My mother was told to wait for the next flight back to Colombo at 16:30 and treated her like she was a criminal. Unfortunately I had to take the flight due to work commitments and leaving my 82 year old mother in Dubai as it was a foreign country and with her age I felt helpless.

I told her that my mother need to take her medication on time so she have to have the meals on time the agent said don‚Äôt worry Emirate will provide my mother with food and water, however this was not the case my mother was told to sit and wait from 08:00am to 16:30 without a drop of water. They have taken her passport and she was escorted by the police like she was a criminal, she has gone through very unpleasant and prolonged experience at the Dubai airport.
She was physical and mentally stressed due to this horrible ordeal. I want her to take the emirate flight to LGW to make a point that she is not a criminal and her to get rid of the nightmare that she lived in DXB airport.

I submit the application to the UK visa and my mother was granted with the returning resident visa from 26th June 2023 therefore, I have been emailing them for the last three months to customer.affairs@emirates.com, they have been reading my emails, however not a single response nor acknowledgement. I have been submitting a feedback form on Emirates website daily for the last month since I am not getting any response.

All I need them to do is book my 82 year mother‚Äôs ticket to return to the UK by end of this month as she need to collect her new BRP card within the deadline.

There was a counter for manual check-in like in any other airport, the  FlyEmirates Ground Crew (lady who can't smile) standing near the queue forced us to do self-check-in and drop of luggage at the automated machine counter. 
There were approximately 15-20 counters and only one person to assist the passengers, many passengers were confused about the process and one lone staff was running around to help everyone as much as he could, but there was obvious delays due to the confusions.
When we did the checkin in the automated machine, instead of getting 2 seats next to each other, we got 2 separate seats far from each other (one was in E row and other one in D) even though we travel together.  
There was no option to select seats, the seats were randomly selected by the computer.!!
When we approached the visibly exhausted ground crew for help, he pointed us to other counter to change seats manually.
The person on the counter was very busy with mobile phone, even though there were many passengers waiting. When our turn came, he said the flight is overbooked, he cant help (he also seems visibly exhausted and cant smile). So we went to the counter of the supervisor, an Arabic accent person sitting there said i a very arrogant tone """"no seats, you should have paid if you wanted seats together"""", as if Fly Emirates was a budget Airline!!! Well if a minor travels with her mother its normal to allocate seats next to each other, even on budget airline. I understand that may be the flight was overbooked and we came 2.5 hrs earlier for checkin, probably we should have arrived at airport 3.5 hrs earlier. 
The supervisor could have been more empathetic and professional in handling such a small complaint. A lady crew, standing next to the supervisor was more empathetic, she informed us with a smile to speak to the cabin crew when we board the flight and they probably could help.

On thing I noticed was that, the ground staff need lots of training to work under pressure and speak not with arrogance (if not politely) to the passengers. They cant handle even a small complaint politely with passengers.
Fly Emirates may be spending lot on technology, which is good, but they dont seems to invest on training of staff at all. We chose Fly Emirates for a good experience, but it was disappointing with ground crew.

Whenever I asked for a water bottle from a flight attendant, she rolled her eyes at me (as if that was an unreasonable request). Also, VERY bizarre - there were 3 sections of economy class, and we were in the 2nd section, and we noticed that we only got drinks and snacks that were leftover from their first pass in the 1st section of economy class; if everything was taken in the 1st section, that was that - they did not come back to give us any drinks or food - INSANE! Also, we sat in the emergency row, and upon take off, they flipped out when they saw we were holding a jacket in our hands (as if that would hinder our ability to conduct our emergency row duties) as well as the blanket and pillows they provided us in our seats. If you're going to flip out at that, don't provide us blankets and pillows until after we take off!

Dear Emirates Airlines,

I am writing to express my deep disappointment and frustration regarding my recent experience with your airline. I recently purchased a one-way ticket from Bangalore to Miami at a staggering cost of over $5,000 USD. Given the already exorbitant ticket price, I expected your baggage allowance policy to be competitive compared to other airlines in the region, such as Qatar Airways. Unfortunately, this was not the case.

Emirates Airlines stands out as one of the few carriers, if not the only one, that does not permit 3 pieces of luggage for business class passengers. Not only is this policy out of touch with industry standards, but the additional fees you impose for extra baggage are exorbitant. Charging passengers an astounding 900 dirhams (equivalent to over $264 USD) per extra piece of luggage is not only unreasonable but also unfair to travelers who are already shelling out thousands of dollars for their tickets.

Furthermore, my experience at your business lounge was a far cry from satisfactory. Having traveled extensively and experienced various business lounges around the world, I was taken aback by the lackluster service and amenities provided in your Dubai International Airport lounge. The quality of the facilities resembled those found in less developed countries, rather than meeting the standards one would expect from a reputable airline.

This disappointing experience has left me with no choice but to reconsider Emirates Airlines for any future travel plans to Asia, whether for myself, my family, or the clients and groups I regularly accompany on trips across the globe. As someone who frequently travels several times a year, I value the quality of service and fairness of policies when selecting an airline. Regrettably, Emirates has failed to meet these expectations.

I hope that you take this feedback seriously and strive to improve your services and policies to regain the trust and loyalty of your passengers. As of now, I am left with a sense of deep disappointment and frustration that I felt compelled to share.

Sincerely,

The ground crew that I found told me not to worry as if I missed my plane I would be on the next. No interest or concern on me missing a train connection in London if I was delayed. I was shouted at as were some other assisted travel passengers. Eventually I did get whisked through and boarded my flight.
Then the best part of Emirates. Their Customer Service. I made a complaint to them. I was eventually told that the wheelchairs were there at Dubai and there was a ‚Äúdivergence of opinion‚Äù. I understand when I am being called a liar, no matter how it is dressed up. I chased them twice for a resolution as I wouldn‚Äôt accept their goodwill gesture of ¬£50 in airmiles. I have no intention of flying with them ever again, so what use were they. I had to chase up twice what was happening and said that I would involve a third party for a resolution. I got a response saying go on then as we have closed the case.
I know this is longwinded as reviews go, but I cannot stress enough how Emirates are not one of the best airlines in the world. They are a terrible airline and their customer service are diabolical. This made a very long haul flight from New Zealand a hellish journey and the after event complaint being treated in such a blas√© fashion sums them up. Overpriced by fake reputation, terrible customer service from ground crew and staff, and their customer service team ironically.

You can‚Äôt change the flights as it‚Äôs part of a ‚Äòpackage‚Äô even if it‚Äôs a serious medical issue and the only thing you can do is cancel the whole holiday if you buy travel insurance when making the booking (with a separate provider btw not with them). 
Which means you will basically loose the whole holiday and money with no alternative options! 
My son wasn‚Äôt released from hospital in time for the outbound flight as he was still unwell and unfit to be discharged from hospital  and so my husband and other two children had to continue with the trip minus my sick child and I. 
If you miss a flight with Emirates airlines they can refund you the tax back from the unused flight‚Ä¶ so they sent me a tax refund receipt‚Ä¶ But Emirates Holidays won‚Äôt give a tax refund because again it‚Äôs a ‚Äòpackage holiday‚Äô so that‚Äôs not an option to receive the tax back for the unused flight either!

3.94089269638062,5.39634847640991,"Emirates Airline Hospitality",1,"I recently embarked on a family trip to Dubai through Emirates Airline, an experience that initially promised to be exceptional. Our vacation was truly remarkable until the unfortunate return flight on August 5, 2023, aboard EK366 from Dubai to Taipei, scheduled for 3:40 AM. My family, comprising four members, secured middle seats 68 DEFG in Zone 6. This information is pertinent for the management's understanding, without the need for specific names.
My expectations were naturally high, given Emirates' reputation. The journey began on a positive note as the crew, adorned in their Simon Jersey-designed uniforms‚Äîcomprising red hats, cream scarves, and beige suits‚Äîwelcomed us aboard with smiles and guided us to our seats. However, the atmosphere shifted as the plane prepared for takeoff. The crew, shedding their red hats and beige scarves, also seemed to discard their friendly demeanor. Their attitude transformed from welcoming hosts to stern disciplinarians, akin to strict teachers maintaining order in a classroom or stern jailers.
This transformation in their demeanor became apparent through their conduct, which ranged from patronizing tones to outright arrogance and offensive remarks. One incident, in particular, deeply troubled me. I observed a distressing scene where a cabin crew member addressed a Chinese passenger in an impolite manner. In a rude and dismissive manner, she pointed towards the restroom while querying the passenger if she had lost her senses, saying in Chinese, ‚ÄòÂ∞èÂßêÔΩûÂ¶≥Â§±ÊÜ∂‰∫ÜÂóé?‚Äô The passenger had merely sought guidance to the restroom, and yet the crew member's response was derogatory and demeaning. To my surprise, the passenger even felt compelled to apologize for apparently upsetting the flight attendant. This incident raised concerns about the potential existence of a biased attitude towards Chinese passengers, despite the flight attendant herself appearing to be of Chinese descent.
The condescending undertone in the crew's interactions was palpable. Their instructions, though simple, were delivered in a manner that suggested an assumption of the passengers' ignorance. For instance, a crew member instructed passengers to fasten their seat belts as the sign illuminated, but it came across as a patronizing reminder rather than a standard safety announcement.
Another troubling incident occurred during meal service. The crew member attending to my aisle approached and informed me, """"I only have scrambled eggs available. You can either choose that or wait for me to bring chicken."""" I opted to wait, requesting a cola and a mini brandy while I waited. Strangely, each sentence from the crew member was accompanied by an insincere smile that felt more like an act than genuine hospitality. However, the real issue emerged when the promised meal failed to materialize. Several passengers in my aisle, including those who had chosen the chicken option, were left without meals. Meanwhile, my family had already finished their meals, having been served from the other aisle.
After what seemed like an extended period, during which the crew ignored my attempts to call for assistance using the call light, I grew frustrated. The crew continued to pass by without addressing my concerns. This situation extended to other passengers in my aisle as well. It became evident that we were all in the same boat, experiencing neglect. Nevertheless, the fear of potential repercussions seemed to discourage any collective complaints. The crew's tactics of intimidation were effective in silencing dissatisfaction.
Frustrated, I decided to approach the crew to voice my concerns. It was only then that they acknowledged the oversight in our aisle and shifted the blame to a crew member supposedly on her debut trip. An apology was only forthcoming when I insisted upon it. Unfortunately, this incident cast a somber mood over the remainder of the flight.
Emirates has always been regarded as a premier airline that leaves no room for being undermined or making passengers feel insignificant. It is plausible that the crew in question may have been having an off day, contributing to the unfortunate experience. Nevertheless, the impact of their behavior lingered, prompting passengers to share their grievances even at the baggage claim area. One passenger humorously referred to the crew as """"the witches of Emirates,"""" revealing a sense of discomfort and avoidance when interacting with them.
This was an unfortunate departure from my previous experiences, and it was disheartening to witness such a lack of professionalism on an Emirates flight. It is my hope that my feedback will contribute to the improvement of future passengers' experiences, maintaining the standard of excellence that Emirates has long been associated with."

It is nice to recline to sleeping position, but the cocoons have sacrificed a lot of space. Business class seats used to be a lot wider once upon a time, and the reclining capacity was already such to allow a very comfortable journey. Maybe a rethink? Just a suggestion

Pricing policy not very clear. We originally booked tourist class as the business class pricing was absolutely prohibitive. We then upgraded the return and after a couple of calculations realised that the cost was a fraction of what we would have paid if we booked in the business class from the onset.

That suitcase has five weeks' worth of clothes, supplements, and skincare products. I am in a foreign country without basic necessities and I had to spend money on things I didn't plan on. Most of the stuffs I have in there are not able to be purchased here. My holiday has become a disaster because of this mess ü§¨

Up to this day, no one has contacted me to give me ANY update on their search. I keep having to chase them up via emails, live chats, and phone calls.

People at the call centre are hopeless and clueless. They give different information every time I speak to them. First they told me it was never transferred to them by Qantas in Singapore, then it was checked-in but never made it on the plane to Dubai, and then they said they are waiting for Singapore and Qantas to respond to their emails and that they can only communicate via emails because there is no contact number. Any escalation made will require at least 8 business hours for a response, which I never received, even until today üôÑ

I wrote complaints on their websites and their response was just an email to say they will get back to me within 30 days ü§£

I also have not received, or even been offered, any compensation for the items I had to purchase because of this incident.

What kind of customer service is this?

It would have been nicer to at least get daily/regular updates about this issue. Why am I doing all the work when it's their fault that my suitcase didn't make it to my destination? üôÑ"

During my flight, I encountered an unfortunate situation with one of your flight attendants. The hostess in question was not only rude but also failed to provide a basic level of service. I had a medical condition and needed water to take my medication. Despite politely requesting a glass of water, I was made to wait for an unusually long time before my request was attended to. This delayed water service put me in a very uncomfortable position, affecting my overall flight experience.

Similarly, on my return flight, the extended delay left me feeling frustrated and exhausted, particularly after a long journey.

Baggage Wait Time:
Adding to the frustration, upon my return to Dubai, the baggage retrieval process took an exorbitant amount of time. I waited for more than an hour to receive my baggage, which was an unexpected inconvenience after a long flight.

I was a passenger on Flight EK180. I had anticipated a comfortable and enjoyable journey, particularly as Emirates Airlines has a reputation for offering a superior business class experience. However, my expectations were far from met, and I feel compelled to bring these concerns to your attention. Firstly, the aircraft itself appeared to be outdated and in dire need of refurbishment. All the features within the cabin were noticeably old and resembled a vintage setup rather than a modern, top-tier airline. The seat controls were broken, which prevented me from adjusting the seat to a restful position. Even the cabin crew acknowledged the issue but were unable to rectify it. This inconvenience significantly affected my ability to relax and enjoy the flight. Furthermore, the entertainment system on board was extremely frustrating to use. In this day and age, when touch controls are the norm, it was disheartening to find that the system was not responsive and difficult to determine whether it was broken or simply unresponsive. Selecting different options or exiting menus proved to be an arduous task due to the delays in the system's response. This experience was far from what I expected from Emirates Airlines, especially when considering the high standards associated with your brand.

Emirates Flights 222 & 713 in business class.  DFW-Dubai-Lusaka and return.  Departure 26 May 2023.
Business class check-in at DFW was good.  First shock was Emirates business class lounge at DFW.  Emirates uses the Capital One lounge.  We had to go on a waiting list to get in‚Ä¶.A WAITING LIST!!!!  The lounge was small, noisy and reminded me of a high school cafeteria.  
Next shock was the seating on Emirates flight 222, DFW to Dubai, a Boeing 777-200.  Seating was 2-2-2.  I looked at seating charts of United, American and Delta 777‚Äôs and all were 1-2-1,  much better and the standard for business class on 777‚Äôs.  No climbing over your seat mate to get to the lavatory.  Service was OK, on par with U.S. carriers.  When compared with Asian carriers (Korean, Cathay Pacific, ANA, Singapore) Emirates has a lot to learn.  The seats had very little storage owing to the 2-2-2 configuration.  They were comfortable while upright but were terrible in the lay-flat position.  The ‚Äúbed‚Äù felt like an old fashion rollaway bed with that bar in the middle.
Because of a 20+ hour connection in Dubai, Emirates provided a hotel (JW Marriott) and transportation to and from the hotel.  That was appreciated.
Next major shock was the flight from Dubai to Lusaka, a Boeing 777-300.  Seating was 2-3-2.  Really Emirates, a middle seat in business class‚Ä¶.REALLY!!!  Because Emirates crammed another seat in each row, the seats were narrow and no storage in the seat area.  While the seats were lay-flat, they did not go horizonal but rather were tilted.  I am sure that was so they could cram an extra row of seats in business class.
Overall, Emirates was a huge disappointment.  I am sure some people will say ‚Äú you should try Emirates Airbus 380 business class.  Its fabulous.‚Äù  My answer is, every Airlines 380 business class is fabulous.  I am at fault for not doing due diligence prior to making the reservations.    In future travels we will avoid Emirates at all costs."

I used to exclusively use Emirates to fly internationally, but after these past 12 months of flying with them (6 long haul flights in total), I'm definitely going to start using other airlines. I'm sure they won't notice a difference, they've amassed a big enough customer base at this point. But like any unspoken 'contract' we get into, there's a need to review every so often to see if it's still worthwhile. 

The service on flights is far too variable, and the value and quality of what's offered has also declined significantly from previous. It's as if they're trying to get away with just the bare minimum requirements of an airline service. 

Excited to be exploring other options out there. Hope things get better with Emirates"

I can never fault the crew on board and how interactive and attentive they are, they are the main reason I choose to fly Emirates

The next issue arose 5 hours into my flight, where I was informed that one of my bags wasn't able to be loaded onto the plane, while I understand that these things happen (despite paying ¬£114 for excess baggage) I was told that the bag was on the next flight and it was to be delivered to my address by the time I woke up 

This then leads me to waking up this morning to no sign of a bag, with another flight planned for tomorrow morning, I stressed on the plane we would need this bag in order to wash and repack ready for the morning, I called the emirates baggage departed and the women informed me that my bag wasn't actually in Dubai and was due in tomorrow morning instead, which is a huge inconvenience as were due to fly on our honeymoon with no clothes! When I asked to speak to someone higher up in regards to compensating a shopping trip I was told there was no one to speak to and to wait for a call in the evening from the baggage team, I then processed to jump onto a live chat with an advisor to then be told the bag is in Dubai and that it could be delivered to me in the afternoon and would receive a call within a few minutes, now after 30 minutes I am yet to receive a call, unsure if the bags are actually in the country or not and still unable to speak to anyone within management

About an hour of napping I was aware of movement around me, I opened my eyes to see a 30yr old-ish man sat on the flight attendances chair (the one they sit in for T/O and landing) and looking rather unwell, totally spaced out, eyes rolling and not with it at all, the F/A around him trying to give him water and trying to find out what was wrong, my first though that he digested something illegal and it had burst inside him.

Then all of a sudden he dropped to the floor like a sack and put into the recovery position by the F/A's, at this point myself (middle), my wife (window) and another passenger (aisle seat) have all woken up and due to the limited space in front of us now occupied with fainted man and 4 F/A's giving him oxygen and with the Defib at the ready we were all crouching with feet on the chairs.

We were all then moved to the back of the plane to free up the space, after 2hrs and a glass of Champagne and a few chocolates we were told that we could go back to our seats for the remaining 2hrs, Man was back in the F/A's chair and looking much better, didn't really find out what was wrong but pleased he was OK and that we didn't get diverted.

If you think that was bad....Now for the return flight!!!

We've had kids (now adults), we don't mind kids, I love kids, I know that they cry and we know that children in enclosed spaces for a long time is a disaster waiting to happen.....
But OM*G...picture this Mum & Dad and three children, approx. 3yrs girl, 1.5yrs boy and a baby boy in the bulkhead bassinet, yes they brought some snacks and toys for the kids, but for the whole 7hrs overnight flight home one of them was always and I mean always CRYING/SCREAMING....

When the 3yr old wasn't crying and the other one or both was, she was exploring the plane, even taking food of other peoples trays or touching screens that people were trying to watch, and even managed to squeeze pass the trolley, even the F/A came down to the """"parents"""" to ask them to get her as she's in the galley and they can't look after her.

Totally un-prepared poor parenting even when we hit turbulence and the seatbelt lights came on Dad tried to sit the girl in her seat but the girl kicked off so she got up and was laying on the floor by the toilets playing and Mum refused to get baby out of the basket as he's just gone down, I understand that the F/A's couldn't do much about the crying but the safety factor should of been addressed.

This could of turned ugly from other passengers as you could feel the tension and as soon as we landed and even before the seatbelts lights went out people around us were up and trying to get away from them.

Yes it could of happened on any other airline but unfortunately it wasn't hence our poor experience."

-0.0618475340306759,4.858642578125,"Emirates Refund Issues",1,"My last trip with Emirates has been deeply disappointing, marked by frustrating incidents that raise concerns about the airline's commitment to customer satisfaction and safety. The issues I encountered include a significant problem with their cancellation policy, lack of responsiveness from their customer service team, concerning safety practices, refusal to reimburse for damaged luggage, an extensive delay during the return flight, and a stark contrast in service quality between Economy and Business class.

Regarding the cancellation policy, I received misleading information from three representatives, who assured me (on a monitored and recorded line) that I would receive a full refund if I canceled within 24 hours. However, they failed to mention the crucial condition that this only applied when the flight was at least 7 days after the initial booking. As a result, I tried to cancel within the 24-hour window but could only reschedule. This costed me a $500 loss vs. the option of cancelling and booking a new flight for the following day. Despite Emirates acknowledging in writing their mistake, they repeatedly refused to provide a price match or refund, and eventually even stopped replying to my follow up messages on the open complain.

The lack of responsiveness from Emirates compounded my frustration. Numerous follow-up messages went unanswered, showing a lack of interest in resolving the issues I faced. It is disheartening to be met with silence and indifference after such a disappointing experience.

During the flight, I was alarmed by a safety practice where all blankets were collected and piled in front of the emergency exits to save time (see attached pictures). This compromises passenger safety by potentially impeding access to emergency exits during an evacuation. Safety should never be compromised for convenience and cost cutting.

Emirates also declined to reimburse me for one of two damaged pieces of luggage, despite the damage occurring during their handling. This refusal to take responsibility for passengers' belongings is disappointing and reflects a lack of care.

Furthermore, the return flight experienced a significant delay for a missing document, resulting in passengers being seated on the plane for over two hours, including boarding time. Despite the delay being just a few minutes short of two hours, the lack of updates, assistance, and provisions such as free Wi-Fi or refreshments left passengers feeling inconvenienced and neglected.

The stark contrast between my previous exceptional experiences in Business class and this subpar Economy class trip is disheartening. The service quality and care for Economy class travelers fall short of expectations.

In conclusion, my trip with Emirates in Economy class has been marked by disappointment and frustration. The misleading cancellation policy, unresponsiveness, inadequate handling of luggage, safety concerns, lack of consideration during delays, and disparity between Economy and Business class experiences paint a negative picture of the airline's commitment to customer satisfaction. I strongly advise travelers to carefully consider their choice of Emirates for Economy class travel."

Good legroom. Excellent entertainment (although the selection was severely compromised on the A380 to Narita outward journey for some reason.

Cleanliness a bit of an issue: the last passenger in my seat had marked their territory with chewing gum under the arm-rest, which thankfully ended up on the pillow rather than my clothes. The bathrooms ended up really filthy and smelly by the end of the trip. Food service a little chaotic.

Check-in at Copenhagen airport:
We did online check in and purchase seats ahead of the check in to make sure we were seating together (because that's how you should start a honeymoon).

Flight to Dubai;
Plane was OK. Cabin crew was OK. Food option was underwhelming for vegetarian. Before the flight we selected vegetarian food for my wife but they didn't have vegetarian as option, they had vegan and all bunch of other religions linked food option. So she went for vegan and that was pretty boring food. Mine was OK, but far from what I would expect from such a company. The on-board entertainment was great. Lots of options. It is annoying though how much advertising about Dubai you get. Before every single movie or series episode there comes longs adds about the magnificent Dubai and some other stuff. We were a bit unlucky with our fellow passages as well. There was a family with a kid (about 10 years old) who spent the whole flight walking around with his tablet listening to some loud techno music with no headphones while at same time whining to his father. I politely and discretely asked a crew member if he could ask the family to put headphones and he said he cannot because people can go what ever they wanted.

Arrival to Dubai:
We were a few hours only in Dubai airport and the thing that I remeber the most is the shouting. Everyone is shouting. Fellow travellers but specially the ground staff. Every single instructions was given in shouting voice.

Flight from Dubai to Bangkok:
This was no different from previous flight. Same issue with food (super boring).

I was allocated seat number 42A but there was a strong pungent smell of urine/toilet around that seat. I approached the air hostess about it and all she did was to provide air freshener.

If you consider the latest increase in price tickets (an understandable worldwide phenomenon but where Emirates has been comparatively heavy on the price hikes), you really get the impression that you are being squeezed out of your every AED. It is unfortunate to reach a negative sentiment for a company that used to be so great at every aspect of Customer Experience. 

Some additional examples :
 - The mobile app's un-friendliness, where you are repeatedly asked to reference passport & personal details each time you travel (unnecessary repetition). 
- Booking flex tickets and realizing that there is a charge of AED 250 to modify your flight dates (which is the whole purpose of booking flexible, an extra charge that wasn't there last year)

Sadly the experience was lacking. The aircraft felt dated. The economy class seats were punishingly painful. The food was terrible. The seats and the food to me are a reflection of what the company thinks of economy class passengers. 

The way economy class passengers are treated by airlines and airports is simply disgusting. 

Economy passengers should mutiny and start their own airline that treats them like human being and not animals. 

Airports should do a better job looking after economy class passengers. Better seats at gates. More airport  hotel options. 

Economy class passengers are treated like second class citizens.  This is wrong. 

All business class  airlines have failed in the past which means economy class passengers are essentially to a company‚Äôs survival."

however we did have 3 other flights on emirates and on each of these flights we had issues with meals. the incorrect meals provided for the children and the return flight back to johannesburg there was no special meal allocated against my name despite me having booked this online about 2 months ago.
i also specifically advised telephonically when i called to arrange special meals for the children that they are vegetarian and do not eat eggs, meat or fish of any kind yet the kids were given lacto ovo meals - which contain eggs which they are allergic to and they therefore could not eat any meals onboard the flight.

my sons controller was also not functional and as a result he could not use it to play any games on board to which he was very upset about.

there were too many issues on board both our long distance flights and we were rather upset about as this put a dampner on our spirits right at the beginning which we really looked forward to.

Because of this I missed my flight, I had to renew my passeport in less than 24h and lost 2 days payed stay at the hotel. I had to pay 300$+ ticket as penalty to board on the next flight not to mention the psychological distress I was put under (I have depression/anxiety disorder) .
I was travelling with a group and someone in my group has checked in with no problem with passeport validity less than 6 months.

At 4pm on the day of the flight I got some emails from Emirates. First one was about a 3 hour delay to the first leg. The Second one was about a rescheduled connecting flight.
Basically because of a predicted delay of 3 hours on first flight takeoff (due to the incoming plane having been switched because of a technical error at its previous departure point, crew plus airplane model having been switched in 3 hours including passenger offloaded an reloaded at Dubai end - I found this out later, if it is to be believed).
My second leg was now to leave Dubai after a 15 hour stopover for me.
I contacted their support line in chat mode to complain about the 15 hour gap and the rep. told me nothing of use except that if I wanted to use their lounge, it would be 130 usd or so for 4 hours. haha.
So I went to Dublin airport to check in for the delayed first leg. The checjkin agent asked me about my checkin bag - take off at Dubai or leave checked through. I didn't fancy having my backpack along with a case stuck in an airport for 15 hours so I said check it through.
Flight leaves 3 hrs late, as expected and lands in Dubai. I find emirates reps standing at the gates asking passengers with connections to approach. I then find out that I am entitled to a hotel voucher, transport to the hotel, and meals at the hotel. It is an emirates hotel.
All very organised. I am given my next boarding pass, a voucher for transport and accommodation and directed to i 3 to wait for shouttle.
staff tell me to sit at exit 3 for a few minutes and about 20 minutes later I am standing in the hotel bedroom. Luch is in an hour, which I enjoy. It is a buffet with quite good food. Later I go on a 2 hour city tour for 30 Euro - from hotel and back. then a nap and later dinner. All paid for.
Shuttle later to airport and early checkin - as is normal for emirates.
The reschedule connection itself was a bore as it had a stopover in BKK which lengthened the return to HK.
All in all, it was a very well organised approach by Emirates and their ground staff. I would have given them 10 out of 10, but the lack of communication from online help (I would have been less pissed off if I kew I was getting a hotel) and their checkin desk (I would have not checked my case through if I had known I had a hotel). Also, I find their hostesses are trained to be smiley but are not particularly nice people. So, a couple of points deducted."

Couldnt get answers to simple things like where can we get out bags, After about an hour and a half they herded us one way and then the other - leaving everyone back in passport control in long lines. Then after finally getting back into Germany there was not one person from EK to be seen to find out when we would get our bags. The ONLY EK supervisor I did see for a fleeting minute when I asked where the 1st Class bags were - told me """"I will check with my colleague"""" and never saw him again. 

My bags came out second to last and that was about 3.20am. Munich Airport is one place I would stay as far away from as possible because if you get a disrupt then the EK staff there are NOT much help."

Prior to our journey, we made significant efforts to ensure that special assistance would be provided for our son. We contacted Qatar Airways' customer care and sent all relevant clinical letters outlining our son's specific needs. We also took great care to secure and pay for preferred seats, anticipating a smooth and accommodating journey for our family.
Unfortunately, our experience with Qatar Airways fell short of our expectations. On both the outbound and return flights, we faced numerous inconveniences and instances of negligence. During our flight to Colombo, we encountered difficulties in receiving the expected special assistance for Son, despite having made prior arrangements. The lack of proper communication and preparation on the part of Qatar Airways made the journey uncomfortable and stressful for our son.
Moreover, during our return journey, we were denied boarding due to a communication/technical fault on Qatar Airways' end. As a result, we were compelled to book alternative flights with Emirates. We would like to express our gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service and support provided by Emirates throughout our return journey.
Unlike our experience with Qatar Airways, Emirates demonstrated a commendable level of customer care and attention to our needs. Although we had not pre-booked special assistance for our son due to the last-minute nature of the booking, Emirates ensured that our children received the necessary support. Additionally, Emirates staff went above and beyond to allocate us preferred seating, which greatly contributed to our son's comfort and overall well-being during the flight.
Furthermore, we would like to acknowledge the outstanding assistance we received during our layover in Dubai. The airport buggy driver, upon hearing about our experience with Qatar Airways, took the matter seriously and guided us to find help and accommodation at the Emirates Premier Inn outside the airport. The staff responsible for hotel bookings, as well as the check-in desk officer at Premier Inn, were extremely helpful and accommodating. The hotel restaurant provided an excellent buffet lunch that catered to our specific dietary requirements, allowing our children to enjoy a satisfying meal. The cleanliness and comfort of the hotel room, including the exceptionally clean bathroom, were highly appreciated.
Our connection flight to Manchester with Emirates was half full, but the service provided by the airline was commendable. Our baggage was collected without any delay, ensuring a seamless transition, and our children were able to attend school on the same day, thanks to the efficient and timely arrangements made by Emirates.
In conclusion, while we had high hopes for a positive experience with Qatar Airways, we were deeply disappointed by the lack of assistance and negligence displayed during our journey. However, Emirates managed to turn our unpleasant return flight into a pleasant and memorable experience through their exceptional service and attention to our family's needs."

The final insult, I was offered dessert from the first-class cabin. My impression; they thought that I was trying to move to first class! Other cabin staff behaved as expected. Do we need cabin staff in its current dated model at this stage? The food is ordinary; a takeaway service could be provided before entering the plane. I suggest having cleaning and medical staff: (cabin crew, in my years of travel), could be more knowledgeable when there is a medical emergency and security staff.

This information was not clearly mentioned in the website - during the booking process we were directed to emirates India website - which was weird since we had allowed website cookies so they knew we were booking from USA - rates were not in USD which was confusing and it did not say anywhere that they will not allow cancellation within first 24 hours.

The pilot made requests of the passengers to be seated and there was no crew in sight to reinforce the message and was left to a passenger to manage a tense and combative situation.

Departure was supposed to be 4.45 am, but we hadn't boarded even at 4.30 am, while the guy at the counter kept insisting that the flight was on time. I was concerned as my connection time in Dubai was two hours. The first leg of the journey was mediocre and the meal served was just ok, and nothing gourmet as advertised, and the onboard service was just so-so.  The breakfast that was served listed an omelette being served with spicy ketchup, but when I asked for ketchup was told that there was none. And, this was Business Class, and not Economy! After clearing security and making my way to the Lounge, I was told that I had only 20 minutes to spend there before I would have to proceed to the gate.  The Lounge, however, was very pleasant with a fairly nice choice of food, but unfortunately was unable to partake due to the limited time I had.  The added convenience of going to the departure gate from within the Lounge was nice.  The second leg of the journey, which was 16 hours, was even worse.  On board service was the pits, no welcome drink, or any of the other expected perks.  They seem to have moved away from providing pajamas, and the """"on demand"""" meal service.  The call button was not answered for long periods, and my TV monitor did not function in spite of repeated requests to the Staff.  They would say that they would reset it, but never bothered to come and check whether it was working or not.  In the last few hours of the flight, I finally contacted a Supervisor who then """"manually"""" reset it for me.  The Staff has a lot of learning to do from their rival airline Qatar Airways.  Again, the food was nothing great, nor were the choice of beverages.  I asked for a hot cup of tea with cream, but was served cold tea with even colder milk.  I was very surprised at how the age of the aircraft was showing on both the A380s that I traveled on.  The other surprising fact was the state of the restrooms, which were not cleaned as they are supposed to be.  All in all, paying close to $4000.00 for a one way trip was a total waste of money.  I should have taken the choice of the much, much cheaper British Airways flight that was offered by my travel agent for the level of service that I experienced on Emirates."

6.70682716369629,7.6348614692688,"Emirates Flight Review",5,"In early May I had the absolute privilege to fly Emirates' Business Class from Melbourne (Australia) to Rome, via Dubai, then the return flights home again just yesterday.

My flight numbers were:

Melbourne-Dubai EK408
Dubai-Rome EK095
Rome-Dubai EK098
Dubai-Melbourne EK406

Three of the flights were on the incredible A380 and the other, from Dubai to Rome was the 777.

The standout for me was the crew on board all flights, but especially the really long hauls between Melbourne-Dubai. They were fabulous, greeted us with a smile, were there for a chat and treated each and every passenger warmly. 

At the beginning of each long haul flight, the Cabin Supervisor came and introduced himself and welcomed us on board (Raghid on EK408, Melb-Dubai on 2 May and Mohammed on EK406, Dubai-Melb 7 June).  They were so wonderful and were a credit to themselves and the airline.

Beyond that, all of the staff were attentive, kind and were all too happy to go above and beyond to make sure I had a good flight.

The cabins themselves were good and I enjoyed the window seats I had (seat letters A & K with the seat closes to the window). My favourite spot was 9K, where I had a great view unobstructed by the wing. 

The final flight had the new makeover interior, with cream leather seats and the whole cabin seemed brighter and cleaner than the older design. Another perk was the seat itself, as one side of the armrest descended into the seat to make the bed wider overall and much more comfortable for sleeping.

An added perk is the bar, which is nice if you want to get away from your seat for a while and the new layout, with cream leather is much nicer than the older style design.

The configuration of the 777 is as I'd read and seen on reviews - it isn't up to standard for business class. Yes, the seat is comfortable, but the layout isn't. Having to step over someone - or in my case, disturb them so they'd move out of the way so I could go to the loo wasn't a great experience. The seat I was in, 11K, didn't have a window next to the seat so I had to crane forwards to look out. Thankfully this was on the way to Rome and I was so tired I slept most of the flight.

 Outside of the in flight experience, as I had booked a cash flight directly with Emirates, I also had the privilege of their additional services and was chauffer driven to and from my departure and arrival locations from the airport. 

I also had a very long layover in Dubai, so had the opportunity to leave the airport for some hours, was chauffeur driven to the JW Marriot hotel, where I could shower, sleep and relax properly before my long flight home to Melbourne. 

Emirates takes care of the temporary visa and paperwork to enable this and it's available for passengers on all flight classes. I think the hotels are different though. Also, your luggage is taken care of and you don't have to collect it. I just packed clean things to change and freshen up with in my day pack.

As a result of these fantastic on ground and in flight experiences, I'll happily fly Emirates again, even if it's not in business class."

After a really pleasant flight from South Africa to Dubai I expected the same but it was absolutely horrid. Somebody was sick and the flight had to be delayed until the passenger felt better, which is totally understandable. But, the air hosts/hostesses kept shifting more ill people to the back of the plane ( which I guess is their protocol ). I was a seat in front of all of the ill patients and next to one as well. All I heard was snorting ( REALLY EXTREME SNORTING, every 5 seconds! )  and sniffling. It was really uncomfortable for me. There was a really old man in my row of seats who snorted so much that I couldn‚Äôt even eat. I get it, he was old and probably very sick but, they could have at least made arrangements for me and the other passengers to sit in the empty seats in front. The air hostess also served some people before they served us. I figured that that was because they had special meals. But, those people were done eating for at least 45 minutes or so ( probably way longer because a few of them got up to take their own trays to the front themselves  ) and they still hadn‚Äôt come to take trays and serve the rest of us. 
Because, I was in a window seat I couldn‚Äôt get up to go to the washroom. I couldn‚Äôt disturb the other ill passengers who were around me. People kept walking up and down around me to visit their ill family members without being told to sit down. One guy came about 10 times with his crying baby. So, I couldn‚Äôt eat, and  I couldn‚Äôt even sleep. 
A lot of the issues were to do with the passengers to be fair but, it could have been better managed by the staff as well. The passengers in front of me reclined their chairs but because I was in front of and next to ill passengers I couldn‚Äôt recline mine. So, I was very uncomfortable. 

They also broke both of my suitcases. Both brand new suitcases. One lost a wheel and I had to CARRY it around London until I got to my place , which was very cumbersome and uncomfortable. The other suitcase had a tag broken so that doesn‚Äôt really matter, but still, they were brand new.

Thank you Emirates"

Checkin at Changai Emirates First Class counter was a little disappointing not the staff who were excellent but the checkin area was underwhelming.

I availed of the Qantas Singapore First Lounge before slightly prior to heading to the gate spending  an hour in the Emirates longe that caters for First, Business class passengers. The lounge was comfortable but again a little underwhelming after having come from the dedicated Qantas First Singapore Lounge.

The boarding was through upper deck so you miss the staircase but be sure to take a walk down before takeoff or after landing as the staircase is not in use inflight.

The first class suite has complimentary toiletry bag with luxurious products and you are provided with complimentary pyjamas/slippers for inflight if you wish to change out of your clothes.

The flight attendants are welcoming and you never really need to ask for anything as they are checking on you throughout the flight for any food or drink requirements and to ensure you are comfortable.

The Dom Peringnon is always available along with a selection of alcohol, juice., still sparkling water. This is in addition to the s snack basket and drinks (not chillled) in your suite.

The suite doors provide privacy and the lay flat bed is very comfortable and will be made up as required by the flight attendant.

A good sized inflight entertainment screen and WiFi available depending on signal strength inflight.

The dining is on demand and the meals were well presented and delicious.

The small bar area at the front of first class for exclusive use is also available along with the full sized bar area at the rear of business that serves first and business class passengers. I had some nice Expresso martinis and warm nuts and non alcoholic moktails whilst talking with other travellers.

Anna-Maria was the flight attendant at the bar and when I advised I was travelling onto Croatia and visiting Zagreb she suggested a place for lunch or dinner. I attended on her suggestion when I was in Zagreb and had a nice pork knuckle meal.

The A380 also has the added feature of two showers for First Class passengers. A time slot is booked for 30min use of the bathroom that includes a 5 min shower and the water can be turned on and off as required to ensure you don‚Äôt run out of water.

The bathroom suites which also serve as toilets for first class have complimentary gels , shampoo and many other items. A hair dryer is also in the bathroom.

The approximate 7.5 hour flight time passed quickly and I could not fault the service.

A special memory is the Arabic coffee and date selection served several times throughout the flight.

I look forward to maybe another bucket list flight in the refurbished A380 Emirates planes with some of the refurbished aircraft already flying some Emirates routes.

A great experience and excellent inflight service by all flight attendants."

This trip was our first journey with our infant baby and we are very disappointed at every level. What we remembered Emirates for, is gone. The first thing was the location of the seats with bassinet. It was an evening flight and our seats were located next to the catering station. No curtain was put up and it took over three hours for the staff to finish with the meals. They worked very loudly and were not very organized dropping a lot of items and moving back and forth forgetting things. This impacted us severely as it was our time to rest as much possible. No baby meals were offered and they also ran out of a meal option. Also at one point the flight attendant forgot our row when offering coffee which happens but when it was mentioned to her she didn‚Äôt really care. Also this same flight attendant at the start of the flight had taken one of our blankets without asking as we hadn‚Äôt opened it yet. When my partner went to ask where his blanket was they said they didn‚Äôt have any more on the plane. We saw that the cabin crew had stashed blankets for themselves and were using them. On the next leg of our journey the attitude of one of the attendants was horrible as he angrily spoke at my partner for playing with our baby on the floor for a few minutes. The news could have been delivered in a more professional way not with a risen voice. Between the flights the staff forgot to announce for people with baby to come forward until we had asked for it. Additionally, when I had booked the flights, I made a call, ensuring we have a seat allocated with a bassinet. We had been told on our whole trip we have a bassinet seat. Closer to the date of our return I contacted flyDubai and had been told they don‚Äôt provide those seats which nobody had mentioned before. The journey is always long but we used to love traveling with Emirates but that‚Äôs our last trip as things have changed drastically."

Unfortunately, I was diagnosed with cancer less than a month from purchasing. I am never sick and cancer doesn't run in my family. Upon contacting Emirates for a full refund, I was advised to submit the request online. Upon doing so, I was issued a refund of only $200 of my $12,300 paid. I was never offered to use the tickets at a later date. When I reached out requesting to use the tickets at a later date, I was advised no because the tickets were refunded. I reached out to Mastercard for assistance and still nothing although their site states they will assist if a cardholder gets a critical illness.

3.82245540618896,7.89765071868896,"Emirates Booking Luxury",2,"So tbh i have many comments about this business class. I live in dubai and fly 3 or 4 times a year in business to europe. On some routes business class is good, individual seats, full bed, leather etc‚Ä¶ on some others the business class is really subpar, not full beds, not individual etc although prices are always the same and about 25k aed return. Some tickets for that price do not even include business lounge!!! How can you price a full ticket like that, for business class that is much more average than competitors and not offer a lounge access??? I could understand on a highly discounted tickets but this is on the higher price range of any business class tickets.

Secondly they only allow 20kg in business per bag while most airlines allow 30 in economy.  Sorry but my luggage on their own weight about 7kg already so i have 13kg left. 13 kg is approximately the weight of a full hand luggage. So often i end up with almost half empty check in luggage and buy things when i arrive at destination which is ridiculous for a business class.

So all in all you end up paying one of the most expensive business class ticket out there, for business seats that are often the older ones and not full beds or not individual seats, with having to purchase a lounge access and either pay excess luggage or travel with half empty luggages to make their 20kg requirements. 

Furthermore their miles system is the lowest in history. Over 2 years i only accumulated 28000 miles when you need over 100000 for an upgrade and i flew business many times.

It‚Äôs time to look into other options and maybe even fly to different airports with a different airline‚Ä¶."

The flight attendants offered medicine which didn‚Äôt help. As soon as we landed, I felt ill as well with sickness and diarrhoea. The paramedics were called to assess my daughter to see whether she needed to be admitted to hospital. By this time, I had exactly the same symptoms. We both had to be wheeled out in wheelchairs and we were both vomiting and had diarrhoea as we disembarked the aircraft and continued with this right through customs and passport control. We needed to be taken to Boots to buy anti sickness medicine. Despite all the evidence from the cabin crew (5 attendants) that we both needed medical assistance and evidence from the paramedic, Emirates DID NOT ACCEPT ANY RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY for giving us food poisoning and for destroying our flight back to London.

On the second flight my wife ordered lobster with linguini.  Again the lobster was cooked to leather-like status and the linguini a mush.  I ordered 5-spice mushrooms, and these were likewise a mush, as though they had been cooked on several occasions.
The Emirates website is long on platitudes as regards its premium service, however, our experience was altogether to the contrary.
On discussing my gripes with your in-flight attendant, I was told that first class meals are pre-prepared, and delivered to the aircraft, for later re-heating.  I strongly suggest you review this practice, and at the very least make adequate disclosure on your website as to how your food is prepared.
Having regard to the fact we paid Emirates around AUD24,000 for these flights, this state of affairs is tantamount to a con-job, if not a scam.  The money we paid was not other people‚Äôs money, it was our personal money.
My employees and I will give serious consideration to whether we will continue in the future to hand over to Emirates money for such sub-standard service,

Check-in was super quick. Gatwick airport was very quiet at 5pm midweek and I got through security in less than 10mins there - All my flights were on time. 

I was very impressed with the level of service from the cabin crew who were so attentive throughout the flight, I couldn‚Äôt not ask for any more. 

With-in minutes of getting on the plane the Cabin crew were offering me a glass of champagne or glass of juice ( they even offered a 2nd glass if you wanted it )  & The cabin crew personally greeted me and asked how I was etc. I thought this extra touch was impressive.

My seat had a large ‚Äòsized‚Äô TV and noise cancelling head phones, pillow, blanket, lie flat bed, 2x bottles of water, 2x cans of soft drinks and an amenity bag. The in-flight entertainment was excellent, plenty of good movies on offer.

Food choice was excellent and the quality of the food was superior to other airlines that I have travelled on, if you wanted extra light-snacks or drinks the bar/lounge area on the had plenty on offer.

& I was given a generous baggage allowance of 2 x bags of 32kg each. Well done Emirates can‚Äôt wait for my next trip! üëèüèΩ"

The first leg was completed with Qantas ( on behalf of Emirates) and this leg was reasonably pleasant. The second and third leg heading towards Manchester went down hill. 

Firstly I want to say that the staff look exceptional at all times on Emirates- the uniform and presentation is first class. I also understand that it's difficult for staff because they are dealing with some incredibly whiney and needy passengers. However, it would have been nice to have water handed out more consistently during the flights. 

For the first time on a trip, I arrived not only dishevelled ( no fault of Emirates- this is a standard on all overseas travel for all travellers ) but also very unwell. I sat next to a man who coughed continuously ( again, not Emirates fault that he was coughing)... but it would have been nice if they had offered some service- water at the minimum to him. 

I also found the return flights to be quite ordinary. Originally my itinerary indicated two flights, by the time I arrived it was three. I understand they might not have had the numbers but disembarking and returning to the flight was just another icky thing I wasn't expecting."

Obviously we didn't pay, but this Emirates employee then threatened to cancel our tickets if we didn't pay, which was very stressful as we needed to travel to visit a very ill family member.

I flew with them several times before, hospitality and cleanliness on the planes  were grand.

For breakfast tasteless, rubbery and smelly pastry was served,  I can't even tell the taste I was having, I couldn't eat that! In general very little choice, chemical taste. The table in front of me was completely used and out of order: it wasn't leveled so all the items were sliding and falling. The cup holder was broken and I had to keep my table opened all the time to have my drinks. 
Also the staffs seem not well trained like before. Me and the passenger sitting beside ordered 2 different juices.  When the Stewardess passed us the tray  the passenger next to me  took my juice by mistake  with his fingertips all around the cup's upper rim. The stewardess mentioned to him that it was my juice and she passed me the same cup of juice which the passenger grabbed earlier! I would never expect things like that from large airlines  like Emirates! It was so unpleasant. It could put my health at risk. I returned that cup to the stewardess right away. She didn't even bother to ask me for a next drink. Was she not trained about food health and safety? I didn't get service what I paid for. Deplorable.

1. The delays

My flight was delayed 3 times by one hour. This is unacceptable. They likely need to revisit their timetable since it seems not to be accurate instead of inconveniencing customers. One delay is understandable NOT THREE. 

2. Ridiculous policy

My initial flight was delayed by an hour, however they closed check-in based on the time of the original flight, not the actual (new) flight time.  So, even though Emirates‚Äô policy is to close check-in 1 hour before the flight time and I arrived at the airport over 90 mins before the flight, I was not allowed to check in. They arbitrarily held people to the original flight time even though it had changed. So myself and admit 12 other people were not permitted to fly.  In all my experience flying, I have never encountered such a ridiculous policy. Which brings me to the customer service‚Ä¶

3. Terrible customer service

The check-in staff were incredibly rude. Even though I had checked in online and was there at the airport 90 mins ahead of the flight, I was refused a boarding card. They disregarded my proof of having checked in online and that the notification of the delay which did not mention any policy of requiring people to check in according to the original flight time. Thinking it was just poor judgment on the part of the ground staff I called the Dubai office. 

The staff in Dubai were equally as rude, and told me the same nonsense‚Äîthat online check-in does not matter and that the flight delay did not matter. They even told me that I would be considered a no-show and would have to pay a no-sho penalty and a difference in fare to board the next day‚Äôs flight. They even refused initially to transfer me to a supervisor.  It was only after I insisted that I was transferred to a supervisor, who was sensible, and the issue was resolved.  

3. Planes were ok

The planes are nicer than the alternatives to Abidjan, but not nearly as nice as I had expected. The food- fruit, a muffin and juice box was a bit sad.  Best thing was the in-flight crew who  were very nice.  
But  Not nice enough to make up for the terrible ground staff and staff in Dubai. Not worth it.

We had two legs - Sydney to Dubai and Dubai to London. All of the flight was as you'd expect. The plane was good (legroom ect) however the staff were absolutely terrible. They could not have cared less about taking care of the passengers, and if you had the hide to press the service button, it would take them forever to come, and once they did they had a look on their face that said you were inconveniencing them terribly just by asking for something. 

Had this have just been on the first leg I probably wouldn't have left this review. But the cabin crew on the second leg were exactly the same. And I have spoken with friends who took the same flights with Emirates albeit a few days later and they had the exact same experience. If you're flying economy, I would not recommend Emirates. The staff clearly don't like their jobs and treat passengers like an inconvenience just for asking for a drink. Pay an extra couple of hundred dollars if you can and fly with another airline. I also wasn't one of those problem passengers either. I tried being as pleasant as possible, but the cabin crew are the worst I've ever flown with."

It was our first flight to Dubai to visit our daughter.  We had a very pleasant surprise on board during the flight.  Steward Patryk started to look after us..... He was really very professional, helpful and kind.  His approach to us as passengers was invaluable.  Unfortunately, both my husband and I do not speak English and thanks to Patryk we felt confident and did not worry about the further journey.  Patryk was committed to ensuring that we had something to drink, that the meal was on time, and at the end he showed great interest in whether everything was ok during the flight. He was smiling, funny and during the conversation he gave a lot of information that we could later use during our stay in beautiful Dubai.  I hope that during other flights with your airline,I will be able to meet Patryk more than once, or at least other people performing this difficult profession of steward with such an approach to the passenger.

This I did and 45 mins later still nothing, called again and still no joy. Eventually whilst going to the toilet (not very clean and smelly) I spoke to another steward who did come and get the problem solved. Food was ok, only one drink offered.
Second flight - Dubai-Heathrow - again met with the same attitude by all staff, so unapproachable. Food again was ok but when we got our coffee it was stone cold, didn‚Äôt want to say anything about it or it may have ended up over me! A passenger in front of me put up his hand twice to summon a steward, each time he was told they were busy with other passengers and he would have to wait -afraid to say he‚Äôs still waiting nobody came to him.

The difference between the two legs (stopover in Dubai is only about two hours) are like chalk and cheese and really the Newcastle to Dubai leg ought to be cheaper than the second half of the journey (both legs similar flying time of 7.5 hours).  The service on the bigger aircraft is better than Newcastle-Dubai; the food is okay but nothing to rave about.  The checking in luggage at both KL and Dubai offers no first/business/economy queues and so everyone just crowds around the departure gate. At Dubai, some guy just shouts ‚Äòbusiness class‚Äô and it‚Äôs a fight to get around and past the hundreds of other passengers blocking the doors.

Have used this airline quite a few times over the years. This being our first trip with them since the pandemic. Must admit, flight prices were considerably higher for economy class tickets compared to what we have paid in the past and overall flight experience was just ok this time around. 

Bookings were made directly through the Emirates website, email confirmations of bookings were received immediately. Preflight check-ins were smooth, checking in luggage at the airports was reasonably timely as well. Flights left mostly on time and were generally smooth. Long 10 hour layover in Dubai, midnight to 10am, was neither desirable nor enjoyable. 

Flight entertainment was pretty good. The ICE program is probably one of the best in the business with loads of movie, TV and music options. Flight comfort pretty good. Meal services were above average, nothing outstanding but nothing terrible. In flight crews are pretty good except for our return leg between Dubai. On that leg we had what must have been a crew made up of many new or inexperienced staff. They were making quite a few mistakes with meals for us and others around us and just seemed flustered and unsure how to do their job at various times during the flight. It was really odd. 

Luggage retrieval was very long on both ends of the flight. We waited at the carrousel for 45 minutes in Lisbon and nearly 1 hour bak in HK for our bags. Had never experienced anything like this with Emirates flights in the past nor with our most recent post pandemic flights with other airlines, especially at HKIA.

The food in the lounge is halal, which I don't like. I need non-halal food. 
In Germany there's no restriction, not by law, nor by religion on food substances being non-halal.
The seats in  business are old fashioned. Many other airlines have upgraded their business classes to nowadays standards. 
The crew's theatrical show and costumes are still the same, however still very professional. The catering was sub-standard for business class (The German caterer isn't a highlight). The choice of wines and spirits was outstanding.
Apart from Emirates quality, some pax (children) were very loud and annoying.
Flights from Hamburg always arrive off-limits from the terminal, somewhere in the desert. The shuttle service to the terminal is slow, very slow. It took us 35min to get to the terminal building. Then, traveling by subway to another terminal and walk for another 25 min for the connecting flight, leaving you with less than 5 min in the lounge before the plane starts boarding.
DXB always was a terrible airport for transfers, it only got worse.
Overall, the flight experience remains good, knowing that the crew, both in the cabin and on the flight deck are professionals. But the fare stays in no comparison with the comfort offered. SG Singapore Airlines' business classis even cheaper nowadays. Unfortunately they don't offer  flights from Hamburg..."

Firstly, the more expensive upper deck seats we booked on the a380 on the first leg out were so uncomfortable. Hardly any leg room and strangely high, to the point I could lay my feet down and had terrible cramps afterwards. I have travelled budget long haul and the seats were better. The second leg on the 777 were much better. The food was very hit and miss and I found the service quite rude at points. I asked for snacks on the return leg and was looked at like I'd just insulted the crew.
The disaster hit on the return from Phuket when the plane suffered technical issues just before take off. We were kept on board for a further 2 hours whilst they tried to resolve and then the captain announced it couldn't be fixed and we would spend the night at the airport. We were delayed and hundreds of people, not having a clue what happened next, just left at the gate, whilst the business and first class passengers were hurried away. Nobody knew what was going on, no info. The crew then l left and we were left with no idea. When we were finally ushered back out immigration and put on busses we still had no idea what was going on and to add insult to injury, we weren't given any food or water in 30 degree heat. We arrived at a hotel and were checked in but again no further info, other than a flight change for 24 hours later. No idea when we got food or water or how or when we were going back to the airport. There was another flight at 8am that was still selling tickets online but I was told by the extremely unhelpful online chat service this was full, then later put on a wait list 40 minutes before departure which I obviously wouldn't be able to board. The hotel had no info. Emirates told us to ask the hotel. We didn't get to bed until nearly 2am but were told breakfast was until 7.30am, so got up early after no sleep to find out it was until 10.30. Still no info. Some guests were told we were picked up at 11.30, some 12.30. We found ourselves waiting around reception in case we missed transport. We had no currency left, no mobile service and still no water or food. Finally at 12.30 we were put on a bus and taken to terminal where all passengers had to check in at the same time, so enormous hours long queues. Once in, we were given an insulting 500 baht food voucher, only redeemable in Burger King or Subway, so again huge queues. We finally took off at 6pm the following day and had to endure a 7 hour layover in Dubai with another 8 hour flights after that. Speaking to other passengers, some with family were left on the side of the road with nowhere to stay, some bussed hours away to Patong and many lost seats together, so had small children seated alone.
The final insult was at Dubai, whilst everyone else was given, yet again insulting food vouchers (this time Macdonalds and no enough to get a meal) we were told to collect at the gate. When we got through and walked the 30 minute trek to our gates in one of the largest airports in the world, we were told to go back out of security to go and get it from original gate. The whole thing was an absolute shambles and returning to work without the day recovery I had planned, having been awake for nearly 48 hours was horrendous. I appreciate that technical issues will arise and that's not Emirates fault but the way it was handled and the lack of communication and food and water was completely shocking. We have never recieved an apology. I will never fly with Emirates again"

Never will I ever fly this airline again.  Your cabin crew seem more like they are military trained than service trained.  They don't help you in any way and mostly after meal service they are completely disappeared.  What's the point of cabin crew if they are like ghosts.

Is it better to come late so that we get the option to jump the queue ???

                       To fly from India to UK and back we choose Emirates and there was never a dull moment, throughout my journey.Interestingly, having been happy with Emirates, many of my regular fliying friends had suggested to opt for Emirate's only. Though Iam not a frequent traveller, my journey with the Emirate's was quite pleasant . The Emirates are serving the international fliers for the past 38 years with dignity and sincerity. It looks like they are updating themselves from time to time methodically with new machines and sublimed hospitality.
                            Undoubtedly, I was a royal guest for them since the moment i got into their machne from BIAL on 24-03 -23 to Dubai. I was overhelmed with there unbelievable hospitality and ofcourse there was never a dull moment for us. There service was quite good. Actually, since my grandson could not make it, unwillingly I had to prepone from 2nd april to 24th March. Honestly it was our mistake and Emirates cannot be blamed. Somehow we realized this mistake after being there waiting for the connecting flight to Manchester for about three hours.
                           The realization stuck to us very very late. We were in a such an unfair situation ie me in the upper deck and my wife in the lower deck . When i enquired with Emirates desk authorities on ground zero , even in the rush hour with utmost humility they expressed their inability since all the seats are full. But still, the gentleman on the desk apologically suggested that steward inside the plane are better placed to workout some solution, so much so, me Ravindranath and Umadevi would sit together next to next. We have been living lovingly together for 36 years and howcome Emirates seating arrangement would put some hedges in between?
                          Nonetheless, when we got into the plane and after taking our alloted seats, I apologically requested one of the attendents to put us together assuring him that I don't mind to go down and sit next to her. But, for my utter surprise he asked me to wait for few minutes and to continue to sit in the same place. After few minitues for my utter surprise I saw my lady love being escorted by a flight attendent carrying her cabinn bag to be seated next to me. Is that my grey hair brought her back or is it purely their courteous professionalasim of the Emirates? It looks like,for them,it is a simple excercise.

We were picked up by the Emirates limo service (which was actually a minibus) from our airport hotel and taken to the airport. The driver guided us and our luggage to the First Class check in desk which was good service. Check in was quick efficient and friendly.

After check in we directed to the Nautilus lounge which Emirates use at Madrid, and were far from impressed. The lounge was crowded, partly as a result of a party of about 20 people paying for entry, seating was hard to find, dirty dishes had not been cleared, and the food options were limited.

Boarding was efficient and we were shown to our seats, the much vaunted First Class Suites. I am afraid I found myself describing it as a bit like a tarts boudoir, all mirrors, chrome and gilt, with even a pop up illuminated make-up mirror. 

The amenity packs were very impressive, full of Bulgari products. There was a pop up """"bar"""" with bottles of water and soft drinks, and a basket of snacks, which was a good touch.

I found the seat quite slippery and the seat adjustments seemed to work sometimes and not others. My wife had great difficulty with hers and neither she, nor a cabin attendant could get it back to an upright position for landing. The attendant made the excuse that it was an old plane, but when paying First Class prices you do expect everything to work.

Pyjamas and slippers were offered to all passengers, but sadly they could not offer any to me as only small sizes had been loaded on the plane. I was eventually given a pair of socks!

When it came to food service the attendant had difficulty in finding the release button for my table, which for some reason was hidden behind the seat arm. 

I am afraid the food was not that good. For my main course I chose pan fried beef tenderloin and was asked whether I wanted it medium or well done. I hate to think what it would have been like if I had opted for well done. As it was it was severely overcooked and very dry with the sauce almost congealing as soon as it was put on the plate.

He asked what my solution to the problem would be and implied that this was my problem to solve. For the entire long haul flight my seat was broken and twisted in this manner. Whenever the plane would encounter turbulence I would bounce and twist backwards and my seat would twist further to the right. This was incredibly unsafe. If there was significant turbulence I could have sustained a serious back injury, and in the event of a crash I could have been seriously injured due to this issue. Additionally, I was in extreme discomfort for the entire flight and have had continued back pain since arriving in Sydney (nearly 2 months ago).

When I contacted Emarites regarding this issue I was advised that they could offer me the equivalent of $100 in flight credits (for a $2500 flight).

They have since ignored my follow-up emails.

I politely asked the lady to move and she repeatedly refused. Her husband ( seated in 20G, which was not his allocated seat either) proceeded to swear at me using the F word several times. He stated that he didn't care and that his family was staying put. (They had been allocated seats apart from each other and just decided to occupy other people's seats to suit their own convenience). A member of the cabin crew was present during the entire conversation. The couple had 2 little ones and didn't want to be separated. I told them that they should have pre booked their seats to ensure they sat together. They could also have requested this at check-in. The husband was very arrogant, rude and verbally aggressive. He was adamant he wouldn't move and wouldn't listen. He was extremely rude to myself and to all the crew who attended. At no point did this couple ask me nicely if I'd mind changing seats. By having 2 little ones, they felt entitled and simply ordered me to find somewhere else to sit.

The cabin crew member tried to reason with the couple but the man was very rude so she called a senior member of staff. He came and tried to reason with the couple but they point blank refused to move. Despite being in the right, I was the one told to move by the crew. So my seat had been taken from me, I got sworn at and Emirates decided to move me and not the offender!! Everyone else was seated and I then appeared to be holding everyone up by continuing my protest. By now, I was in tears and too upset to continue standing my ground.

Passengers in surrounding seats shouted at the man to apologize until he eventually did so very reluctantly after initially denying he'd sworn at me. One of the cabin crew confirmed he had sworn as she heard it. So I was promised a seat far away from that couple only to be led away to seat 50A, an arm's length from the toilet!! Seat 50A and B were empty for a reason‚Ä¶‚Ä¶who'd want to sit in such close proximity to the toilet? I expressed my dissatisfaction at the location of the seat but no alternative was offered. The plane was ready for take-off so I had to sit down. Throughout the flight I was plagued by the constant traffic and noise of people going in and out of the toilet.

The offender won: He swore at me, refused to move and wasn't moved. I got moved from seat 20K near the front, right to the back of the plane, the very last seat to sit right by the toilet. Was this the best Emirates could do after permitting someone to remain in my seat?

To spend an entire flight an arm's length from the toilet and having my meals hearing the constant sound of the toilet flushing. Felt as if I was in the toilet as the flushing sound never seemed to stop. There was no chance of getting any sleep. Emirates just added insult to injury by moving me to that seat. If you're vile, vulgar and a law unto yourself Emirates will pander to you. If you're a decent, polite passenger expecting to be treated fairly...Forget It!! ‚òπÔ∏è

We booked an all inclusive package deal to the Maldives, which was not only a honeymoon but also my husbands 30th. Our holiday cost was ¬£9000. We were delayed leaving Manchester airport by approx 3 hours which would have meant we miss our connecting flight, however, the staff on board informed us our connecting flight was going to be waiting for us at Dubai airport so we would arrive at our honeymoon on time. Upon arriving in Dubai we were advised by airline staff to run to our new gate as they had called final boarding and we would make it. After arriving at the gate the staff informed us we had missed final boarding and wouldn‚Äôt allow us onboard‚Ä¶ we could see the plane from the window next to us approx 10 second walk away & still had 30 minutes before departure. The staff said under no circumstances would they ever wait for passengers on connecting flights and that we had to return to the gate we had just left our original flight as there was staff waiting for us with new boarding passes‚Ä¶ we reluctantly headed back to the gate where the staff were in fact waiting for us with our new boarding passes, 21 hours later. We were advised to wait in a certain part of the airport for another member of staff to meet with us. 
3 hours later a member of staff arrived and informed us they will be taking us to a hotel to spend the rest of the time before our next flight. However, our luggage was no longer available so we had to go without. Once again reluctantly we were taken away from the airport to a hotel that can only be described as a covid 19 isolation unit and we‚Äôre sent off to a room - that did in fact have people in there. We were then given another room where we found 2 single beds that were sodden with damp, a lovely view of what looked like a prison and a window nailed shut - not the 5* deluxe suite we had booked and paid for..  No toiletries were provided and again, no luggage. We spent 14 hours at the hotel before being taken back to the airport where we waited for our flight. We were exhausted & totally embarrassed that we were wearing clothes that were now 3 days old, hot, sweaty and just totally deflated. We finally arrived at our destination that was perfect throughout, we had a lovely time although bed bound for the first 2 days due to being poorly - assuming from the horrific journey & lack of ventilation in a soaking damp room. Once the holiday was over and left the Maldives we arrived in Dubai once again to be informed of a delay, we had boarded and waited, waited, waited, every 40 minutes or so the pilot came on to apologise & after watching a movie and a half we were given the reason for the delay‚Ä¶ we were waiting on passengers a from a connecting flight.

A week before the flight was due to leave I kept receiving emails from emirates offering me an upgrade to business class, they wanted ¬£699pp just for an upgrade on the outward journey, for the upgrade all you received was a business class seat, No Chauffeur Car, No Lounge access, No Priority Boarding, You were still an Economy traveller but could sit in business.

Last flight home on our return leg from Dubai we boarded at gate 29B in Dubai. This was a shambles and I can't understand why unlike all other boarding gates we had to join the economy queue and go through a pointless random security check, wherein it was noted that only women where being stopped, the men went through which I find most disturbing!

Every other Emirates gate we boarded an A380 at allowed us to check in and board separate to Economy.

The attendent told me she would have to go to the lounge and fetch some later, I then also mentioned this to another member of the crew and she also came back about an hour before lunch to tell me she would not leave me starving.

Anyway the bottom line is the noodles never turned up, so I did without any food for 7 hours.

The prices have doubled but service has halved or even less. I find Qatar service much better, but the food in Emirates is better if they serve it. The bar area food also leaves much to be desired, and they really don't offer everything to everybody. I saw this first-hand. They are truly skimping on food and beverages which is so unacceptable. Finally, the airport is huge and there is nobody to help you. After a long flight, opposite time zone, I had a 30+ minutes walk with two kids. Everyone I asked including the lounge kept saying 20 minutes but we kept walking and walking and finally found a cart with a disgruntled employee chuckling that we wouldn't make it. I asked him to please just drive. We made it just in time. It was over 40 minutes walk. The main lounge is good, the secondary closer to the area isn't. They have no signs or information. It was such a relief to go from Dubai to India, my gosh, a friendly face and friendly service. Asian service is something else, such a vast difference from European/American service. I have found Emirates air hostesses much more disgruntled and hesitant to offer food easily. Frustrating because we spent $$$$$ on business, at least they could match the service."

Before starting I was told by a friend of mine that although the flight says that it's a direct flight from Auckland to Dubai they will deroute saying some excuse and right enough just before take off we were told that the flight had to deroute via Colombo for refueling as there was fog in Dubai ( which was later found to have apparently cleared up ) This caused us not only a delay of almost 3 hours  but also causing us to miss all the preplanned events from our itinerary which we had booked online and was nonrefundable. The journey itself started with a delay at the airport as the staff were unsure regarding the eligibility criteria for visa on arrival at Dubai (which we had already checked) After 30 mins of waiting and various phone calls the staff at the booking counter let us go saying that everything was now updated. However during boarding we were again set aside as apparently things were not updated against our passports causing further delay .

I had a beautiful golden wedding anniversary planned. This was timed out in such a way as to allow the most experience with my limited vacation. 

Let me summarize the events that transpired, thus caused my wife and I a lot of grief, headache and anguish. 

We live in Colorado, and on the week of February 10, 2023 our state was expecting a snowstorm on the day of our flight. With this in mind, I felt it was wise to contact Emirates and inform them that our flight from DEN might be delayed/canceled, thus impacting our connecting flight from IAH to Dubai. 

During this conversation with the Emirates representatives I was offered upgrades to earlier flights at exorbitant rates. In fact, I called in more than once and the rates varied dramatically. Ultimately, one of the agents told me that if the flight was delayed or canceled to no fault of ours, Emirates would rebook the flight at no additional charge. That was very assuring.

On the morning of February 16, 2023 I ordered a livery service to pick us up and take us to the airport (1 hour ride). We arrived three hours prior to our flight, we were welcomed with the news that our flight was canceled. The remainder of the day was spent at the airport on the phone with various Emirates representatives telling me that we missed the flight and all connecting flights were in-turn canceled. 

Luckily, after hours on the phone a manager listened through all the recordings and called back to admit to the internal error and promised to refund the additional credit card charges for the new flights.

In summary, this erroneous mistake on the part of Emirate booking staff caused us to loose 2 days of vacation, a missed night at the Dubai International Airport hotel, two livery trips and so much heartburn and mental strain that by the time we arrived on the cruise (our destination) we were so burned out from travel that were in no mood to celebrate our golden wedding anniversary on the intended date.

Our main issue is though we got to Cairo airport very early on checking in we were told they could not give us boarding passes for the Dubai to Melbourne leg. After a lot of insistence on our part Emirates staff told us she would be able to when she came up later to the gate in Cairo. We approached her as soon as she came up and after a discussion she informed us that the flight was overbooked and she couldn't issue a boarding pass for Dubai to Melbourne leg. She told us that we would have to go to the gate in Dubai and hopefully get a boarding pass there. We only had 1hr 10 min stop over so we stressed out all the flight from Cairo and both felt physically sick from the stress of not getting a boarding pass. In the end after literally running to the gate we managed to get boarding passes and our flight. This was the end of a great holiday and just put a very sour taste to the end of our holiday. My issue is the airline obviously deliberately over selling tickets. Personally I feel this should be illegal for them to do. A total disgrace and unnecessary stress for no fault of our own. I will never recommend or book with them again. I wonder how many people on that flight did not get a seat. The flight was totally full."

I‚Äôve had more room to move on TUI and Easyjet flights.  Nowhere near as comfortable as KLM economy long haul flights although it has been a few years since I last travelled with KLM.

On these Emirates flights, I really felt like the third class passenger.  Only one drinks trolley round and that was with the lunch meal.  Friendliness of service not great except when boarding and disembarking.  Maybe the business class or first class experiences are fabulous but unfortunately I can‚Äôt justify those exorbitant prices.

On the plus side, the in flight meals were good quality although on two of the flights we didn‚Äôt have a choice of meal as our side of the plane had run out of one of the options.

We were due to fly out of Madrid on the 19/12 to Dubai to connect to another Emirates flight Dubai to Auckland arriving on the 21/12/22. The third leg of our outbound journey involved an internal flight on the 21/12 from Auckland to Dunedin (our final destination). In September 2022, our travel agents (lastminute.com) advised us that Emirates had changed our itinerary which resulted in us leaving Madrid on the 20/12/22. We accepted these changes even though it meant we would have a 10 hour stopover in Dubai and arrive one day later into New Zealand. A few weeks later and prior to our trip we discovered that the third leg of the outbound journey had bot been changed. Our flight itinerary still had the third leg departing Auckland on the 21/12 despite us not arriving from Dubai until the 22/12.  Numerous and very stressful communications were made with Emirates and lastminute.com who both claimed it was the other's responsibility to make the required changes . The changes were never made and this resulted in us making our own arrangements for the third leg at additional cost. Since returning from New Zealand we have asked both Emirates and lastminute.com for a refund for the flight we could not take. Once again both Emirates and lastminute are claiming it the other's to make the refund."

The whole point of being a """"flex"""" ticket is having the ability to change it without paying because guess what Emirates I paid for the privilege originally. 
I called Emirates and when you eventually speak to their staff it sounds like they are losing the will to live, they are useless and incompetent and lie about calling you back they never do. You complain to their management they don't listen overall rubbish service will switch to another airline."

1. Flight from AMS to DXB was average. Airbus A380 economy seats in front are really cramped. Won't recommend. 

2. The layover was absurdly long at 23 hours. I booked for shorter duration but Emirates changed it due to COVID and gave us a hotel room in Dubai. The transport from DXB to hotel was horrible. Van smelled like raw fish from sea being transported in it. Hotel room was dirty. We were alloted room in different wing than westerners. Clear partiality. Breakfast was horrible. In all totally useless and unbecoming of Emirates. In fact in return I paid more than 300 euros and stayed inside airport. Also the visa issue process was cumbersome. Also my spouse's visa couldn't be processed online and we paid from our own pockets for Dubai visa for my spouse. Directions inside the airport were not clear for visa issuing place and bus waiting area. In all it's waste of money going in Emirates considering the costly tickets.

3. DXB to TVM journey was relatively ok. But the waiting inside the terminals in DXB was too time consuming. They made us wait in the lobby for boarding for too long.

4. Food quality is only average in economy as well. It's less of service and more of duty by Hostesses. They just want it to be get done and leave as soon as possible. I have had much much better experience in many other airlines.

All in all I would avoid using Emirates next time."

Their PR team did a great job in building a glamorous reputation for the company, first-class with shower facilities, an open bar, and a private suite‚Ä¶..But if you‚Äôre not part of the club, sorry subordinate beings, brace yourselves for a less-than-satisfactory ride.

What happened was, my daughter wasn‚Äôt feeling well on the day of the flight, due to being sick the night before. We sought medical advice from first-aid at Gatwick Airport after we had checked in at the desk. The Gatwick airport first-aiders concluded that my daughter only needed some rest and wasn‚Äôt against her going on the plane. We got onboard the plane and were immediately called aside by one of the supervisors on the aircraft. The supervisor shot me tons of questions, then gestured for a flight attendant to prepare a vital signs kit but stopped her last minute before she even had a chance to open the box! He then told me that by captain‚Äôs orders, my daughter was unsuitable to fly. The supervisor even said that he had ARRANGED PARAMEDICS WAITING FOR US OUTSIDE IF WE WERE TO STEP OFF THE PLANE. My family of four got off as were told. What shocked me more after we passed through the bridge was --------- NO ONE KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON AND NO PARAMEDICS WERE ON-SITE! Everyone on the ground kept asking us the same question, ‚ÄúWhat do you plan on doing?!?‚Äù I quickly realized that my whole family was left in a state of limbo with no support at all! The truth is, I‚Äôve never come across such dire situation, and we had truly believed that the airline was going to help us, which in retrospect was all a hoax! To add more irony to the situation, the SO-CALLED PARAMEDICS who finally showed up were not paramedics, but in fact the exact same first-aiders we spoke to a while ago. I can tell that they were also in a state of disbelief when we met for the 2nd time. I have to say, the only reassuring comfort we received throughout the entire episode was from the first-aiders, good Samaritans who are patient and willing to step in and offer help, especially when we are foreigners traveling with young children thousands of miles away from home. The first-aiders made the effort to look up affordable nearby accommodations on the internet for us and walked us all the way to the hotel. (HUGE SHOUT OUT TO THE TWO LOVELY PEOPLE AT GATWICK, YOU ARE OUR UNSUNG HEROES!!)  My heart goes out to them with infinite gratitude, but all the while question Emirates‚Ä¶.where was all the help you promised? Because the next day, since my daughter was feeling better, we followed orders from Emirates to rebook our flight. I was in another state of shock when I was told that additional fees (GBP 1,876), which we were entirely unadvised and unaware of, are required, claiming that we were ‚ÄúNO SHOW‚Äù!! HELLO EMIRATES! MY WHOLE FAMILY WAS PRESENT ON THE AIRCRAFT AND WE WERE TOLD TO LEAVE! No one mentioned anything about fees?! By this time, we have lost all faith in Emirates. We ran up to the check-in desk for help. A manager in a brown suit provided us with some advice, but in the end, we had no choice but to comply and pay up in order to go home. We felt deceived in a way and extremely disappointed in how Emirates handled the whole situation---------- leaving us with zero support in the first place and robbing us the next day! We really regret having chosen Emirates for our family holiday. 

And I‚Äôd have to say, I‚Äôve traveled long-haul on numerous airlines ever since I was a child, and never before had I been asked to hand in my headset and blanket 40 minutes before landing. I don‚Äôt think Emirates is aware that the ‚ÄúI-want-my-things-back-right-now-policy‚Äù is a cheap gesture and undermines the oil-rich image of the company. And get real, who would ever want those bulky cheap-looking uncomfortable headsets!? And stripping blankets away from sleep-deprived travelers‚Ä¶ how sweet. As for the highlight of all in-flight services, the catering felt rushed and messy overall. I consider myself not a picky eater, but the food wasn‚Äôt really good (too high expectations), and it also took the crew forever (or never) to begin offering drinks to dehydrated passengers between meals, which only happened once?! And the bathrooms were not very clean at all. I think the only time I saw a flight attendant open up the lavatory door to do something was to pour out leftover drinks she had collected from the previous cabin, and then move on to my cabin to repeat the same operation. Although she had on her gloves and all, I knew where and what she had touched and it simply made me sick‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Really bad experience with Emirates."

Having arrived in Dubai overnight from Sydney I made my weary way over to the Business Class lounge in Terminal A and took the chance to refresh myself on their excellent chilled orange juice and many mugs of coffee. The Lounge close to my gate, A8 was thankfully quiet, but then again it was ca. 6 a.m. on a Friday morning. Boarding was on time & I like the fact that you board directly from the lounge - so quite relaxing and civilized. 

I settled down into the window seat 8B and enjoyed the proffered glass of Veuve Clicquot 2013 Champagne.¬† Once we had reached cruising altitude I moved my seat into the flat position and slept a bit.¬†

Much later I started to move around which meant moving down to the bar to ask for a martini cocktail. Then it was time for lunch. I had the seared salmon as my starter followed by Bzar prawns which turned out to be two large large prawns in a traditional Emirati spice marinade with creamy sauce on a bed of Basmati rice. Spicy! I washed this all down with a couple of glasses of Jermann Pinot Grigio 2021 Italian white wine. To conclude this excellent meal I drank a decent glass of Graham's 20 year old Tawny Port with the 3 cheese board. 

During my return from Sydney, Australia with Emirates I managed to watch the best part of 4 soccer World Cup games live. On this last leg it was the game between Wales vs. Iran. I got to see all but the last 15 minutes of the game before we started our descent into D√ºsseldorf. My attempts to persuade the pilot via the crew to go into a holding pattern until the game had concluded were not successful. In fact I only discovered that Iran had beaten the Welsh as I was waiting for my luggage in the arrivals hall.

In conclusion all 4 flights to get me from Germany to Australia with Emirates in Business Class were outstanding. Not sure when I'll be flying like this again - but hats off to this excellent airline. Brilliant and such a pleasure to fly with."

1- There should not be any shorter alternative connection (Shorter than the one you booked).
2- The stopover at Dubai airport should be greater more 8hrs.
3 - The flight ticket should be higher than 1500$ for one side per passenger if you are Indian (Asian).

So, in most cases, this program is not for economy-class Asian travelers, but they never say it on their website clearly.

Their customer care representative is also not allowed to share this information until and unless you have already booked the ticket. This way they force their flyers to end-up spending more time in Dubai. Hence, fuelling transit tourism at Dubai Airport. If you eventually decide to change your flight, they will convince you to use the money for visiting Dubai instead of spending on flight modifications."

Given the main reason for booking PE was for the extra legroom (my husband is tall) we enquired whether at least we could be moved to exit row seats at no charge. No - we have to pay for these seats at $150 per person per leg!!

My sad return home to Europe started on a Thursday evening back in November. I turned up at Sydney International airport quite early to find quite a big queue of passengers at both the Economy and also the Business check ins. Actually the gates weren't open yet and the staff were still engaged in a pow pow before starting their work to get us all checked in. Even the young couple in the first class check in had to wait a little while. Anyway the check in was quick and efficient and I was soon making my fast track way through security, passport control and then on to the Emirates Lounge. I was one of the first there and I was surprised to see how big and well laid out it all was. The selection of food and drinks was fantastic. One section had been cordoned off - it later became occupied with a group of young men in various track suits, shorts and loose attire. I later discovered that this was the first team of the Everton soccer club who had just completed a short tour in Eastern Australia. 

I met them all again on the upper deck of our plane home - the excellent A 380. Most took to their seats and fell asleep so I assume that it must have been a hard tour. Anyway, I settled down into my Seat 18K and supped the free champagne - the Emirates exclusive Moet et Chandon Grand Vintage 2013. 

After getting to our cruising altitude the drinks started to flow - both served at my seat and at the bar at the back. I focused on nice, extra spicy Bloody Marys and olives. For dinner, I chose the Tuna tataki followed by a spicy Indonesia styled Nasi Goreng. All washed down with white Chateau La Louviere wine from Pessac-Leognan. I always finish with the excellent cheese board. And there was no exception on this flight. 

After that I was pleasantly surprised how the 14 or so hours passed by relatively quickly. I got enough sleep on the flat, nicely made up bed, saw quite a bit of an British police series on the ICE entertainment system and enjoyed the odd Espresso Martini, mugs of tea and shortbread biscuits and the banter with the crew at the bar. Oh, and there was plenty of Live World Cup football to watch. 

Eventually we found ourselves landing very early in the morning at Dubai International airport. 

Emirates remains for me one of the best airlines in the world. And my final words of thanks should go to the efficient, friendly and ever present crew who made sure that we were comfortable for the complete length of tour stay on board."

To Whom It may Concern:

We purchased two tickets (United Confirmation: K4PXW1;
Ticket Numbers: 0162450275029, 0162450275034) from United Airlines to fly from Cleveland to Dubai on December 2, 2022. Due to a flight delay, we changed the original Swiss tickets (UA134 to Zurich & LX242 to Dubai) to Lufthansa tickets (LH431 from Chicago to Frankfurt & LH630 to Dubai. Unfortunately, the Lufthansa Airlines flight (LH431 to Frankfurt) was also delayed for 8 hours. Our tickets were changed by United staff to Emirates EK236 from Chicago to Dubai. 

To assure our luggage went along with our new schedule, we asked Emirates to transfer the luggage during the check-in because many samples for our Dubai meetings were included in the luggage. On December 2 before departure, we also called United Customer Service to remind them about transferring the luggage to our new flight. 

Despite our extra effort, all 3 pieces of our luggage did not arrive in Dubai with the flight. Due to the importance of these pieces of luggage, we contacted United Airlines, Lufthansa Airlines and Emirates Airlines many times (more than 30 times) between December 3-6, 2022. Each time we called, we received confusing answers regarding the status of  our missing luggage.  The United Baggage Service Center even asked us to contact Lufthansa about the missing luggage and refused to issue us a claim number. We are extremely disappointed with the poor Customer Service we received from United and Emirates Airlines. 

While the luggage and all of our personal belongings were missing, we spent more than AED762 to buy clothes and toiletries to maintain basic hygiene and stay alive. There are other expenses such as taking a taxi to the mall many times to buy clothes, as well as eating meals at the mall (only because we had lost the luggage), this cost was an additional AED500.

We came to Dubai for 2 days of meetings from December 6-7 and desperately needed the samples inside the luggage to show to my customers.  Since the luggage only showed up in the late afternoon of December 6, we lost most of the opportunities to show the samples. We almost lost the entire $5,000 cost of this trip. We have receipts for the purchased clothes and taxi expenses as reference if required by any parties.
We requested that  Emirates and United reimburse our AED762+500 for the clothes, toiletries, taxi and meals plus business damage caused by the delayed samples.
So far, both United and Emirates have refused to accept our claim and blamed each other for the mishandling of our luggage We had no way to contact Lufthansa and had no reference number to make any claim.

Since we purchased both tickets from United Airlines and their mishandling caused the loss of our luggage, we feel that Emirates should take the responsibility for our claim because it failed to transfer the luggage and took 3 days to deliver the luggage caused lots of damages. 
 
Thanks for your understanding and help.

The lounge experience luxurious and the standards and comfort on the planes literally first class. Food was plentiful and very high standard and I really liked the privacy of a cabin the was individual.  The staff were incredibly attentive and nothing was too much trouble.

We were held on the tarmac for almost an hour and a half with no explanation. Not surprisingly, we missed our flight. I went to the counter to get rebooked to a new one. It took 2 hours for the (extremely rude) customer service representative to offer me a flight 24 hours later and a motel (1/5 star review on Google). They insisted nothing else was available even though we were seeing tons of availability on our own. Furthermore, they told us we would get reimbursed for ubers and food during the 24 hours. I contacted Emirates several times and have had no such luck in getting reimbursed. They completely ignore you.

Seriously? What did they think I was going to do to him? Why wait 4 hours into the flight to tell us?  My Wife's screen dies, took 20 minutes for an attendant to respond to our request despite ringing twice for assistance. Screen finally rebooted after half an hour and several attempts by attendants. The final straw was the person in front decided to recline their seat which comes back way too far leaving me unable to look at my screen and the person behind me was too large to have my seat on top of them. If we had chosen upper class it would have added another ¬£3,000 - ¬£4,000 ridiculously over priced.

THEN when we make it to Dubai we find out that Emirates staff had actually told us completely the wrong thing and the original flight wasn‚Äôt actually going to miss the connection. 

On our flight back a member of staff was incredibly rude to me when I asked him if he could possibly rinse a baby bottle out for me (I‚Äôd made sure i asked outside of ‚Äúbusy‚Äù times) he loudly patronised me in front of other passengers and then told me I should wash it in out myself in the toilet.

Firstly the plane is cramped like a can of sardines.

Secondly, the bathroom in our section (back of where we were sitting) of the aircraft was dirty, there was water/urine all over the floor and counters. And within 4 hours of the flight one of the bathrooms was locked by the flight crew saying we are storing garbage in the lavatory, which resulted in long lines and also a gentleman having to change his clothes, pjs to pants to be exact, right in front of everyone else.  

Thirdly and the thing that bothered me the most was the Service. This was a 14+ hour flight, and one would think the air crew would be friendly and check on the passengers more, however the only time we saw them was during boarding, food service and dis-embarking and without smiles. After and before the food service they were nowhere to be seen. On other flights with other airlines the air hostesses will come by a couple of time with water/ tea/coffee or just even walk by to make sure if anything was needed. I understand people may want to sleep but you can also do it without waking up the passengers. 

Lastly, the food was no appetizing at all, and not only that but if Emirates is releasing the menu on the app with a couple options (veg and non-veg)  on the plane I was told I can‚Äôt have the veg because I didn‚Äôt order it, Then why was it an option and it didn‚Äôt have anything on the side that said Pre-order.

The booking agent said it was definitely Emirates as they had over booked flights.

Unfortunately the email with tickets had no mention of the cancellation charges, so I contacted the Emirates phone line to confirm multiple times. 
Spoke to 3 different representatives and all quoted AUD225 per ticket for change or cancellation. I even had one of the staff members on the phone with me as I was cancelling the tickets, and they assured that It would be $225 per ticket. 

A few weeks later, I received a refund confirmation and have been charged $500 per ticket for cancellation. On calling the call centre to rectify this issue, I was told to raise a complaint and that my ticket should have the cancellation charges mentioned. This was not true, as there is not a single mention of charges.

The complaint process was useless and clearly there was no investigation of the calls or the information provided to me. Was told that I agreed to the terms on purchasing the ticket.

We booked our flights and honeymoon in April 22 when resorts started to re-open post Covid. We were originally due to fly at 8.15pm on 26Dec to give us a shorter stopover in Dubai and spend Boxing Day with our family. Emirates moved the flight to 13.55pm notifying us early Sept22. This gave us an 8 hour 50 minute stopover in Dubai. Outside of their support policy by 1hour and ten minutes!! 
When I phoned to query this at the time of the change  I was told I had two choices, accept the change or cancel our honeymoon. Cancelling at that point would have meant losing our choice of resort and flights. So we stuck with it. Then on the day it all went bad. 
Firstly the flight out of Stansted was delayed. When we arrived in Dubai we asked at the Emirates Lounge if we could use the facilities and although the lady was very helpful we could only do so by paying $260 for less than half our stop over! I would have thought they could have offered something as the extended stop over was on them. 
Then we checked in for our connecting flight and waited by the departure gate. The flight time went by without any announcement from the Emirates staff. Eventually we boarded but due to the flight taking off nearly an hour and a half late and arriving in Male late we missed our connecting sea plane. So our first night of honeymoon is being spent in a hotel in the City Centre which is nothing remotely like where we should have been staying. The contact details I was given by Emirates as ‚Äúa valued‚Äù customer were at best slow to respond to queries. 

Attached are pictures of where we should be spending the first night and where Emirates put us up for the night. 
I was even handed the bill by the hotel which I clearly refused and told them to call Emirates. 

So thanks Emirates we truly feel like ‚ÄúValued Customers‚Äù. You have really got our honeymoon off to a fabulous start.

I will never flow Emirates ever again, and I will tell everyone I know about my experience here, and I doubt they will either.

I ordered a Flex Plus ticket, literally the most flexible ticket you can get. I'm not a lawyer. I can't track down every single tiny bit of information scattered around the website somewhere. I can't find the exact terms and conditions when they're hidden like they are. I assume, like any reasonable person, that you have the flexibility to move the flights to nearby airports within the same region (such as London to Paris) or to different dates. Sounds reasonable, right?

I booked some return flights to the UK from Australia, with the return set to London late in January before I knew exactly when I would leave and where I would leave from. 

Today, when I decided when I would leave and where I would leave from - Geneva - I discovered that the economy seats on some of my preferred flights were full. That's fine and perfectly understandable.

So I inspected the lists of flights, and selected a series of jumps between various airports that would approximate my desired trip. Additionally, I had to curtail the trip to somewhere other than Perth (such as Singapore), because no flights to Perth were available with Emirates or any Emirates code share airlines. Sounds fine, right?

Wrong. When I called up Emirates to change my booking to this, they immediately baulked at my attempt to end my flight in Singapore or Bali. """"It needs to return to the same city it was booked at"""", I'm told. I ground my teeth with frustration. I'm sorry, why exactly is this a policy? I thought these were flex tickets.

But it only got worse. I then found out that I can't leave from my desired airport - Geneva - either. Not only that, but I can't leave from any airport in the entirety of Europe, and possibly the world, apart from London Heathrow. Why? Who the hell even knows? The best I could make of it was that """"Heathrow is expensive, and we won't allow you to fly from a cheaper airport unless you pay more by purchasing business class"""", which makes absolutely zero sense to anyone. I'm not asking to be compensated by flying to a """"cheaper"""" airport: you should just pocket the difference and smile. But instead, you try to use this as an opportunity to extort even more thousands of dollars out of me.

So you know what? I cancelled it. And I'm sure I'll lose a ton of money due to whatever creative policies Emirates comes up with for refunding partially used return tickets. But this horrible experience has soured me on Emirates forever, so it almost feels like a relief.

You had so many opportunities to make this right, to act like honest, decent people and respect the spirit of your representations. But you didn't. And if your greed and arbitrary policies and lies were exposed to the world, no one would ever fly on your airline again."

2. Our bags to be offloaded and we (The 4 of us) travel without bags.

The staff at the lounge were quite rude as we could get access to two passengers via our FF status, but they would not allow the third person in so I waited outside, whilst my husband and daughter used the lounge.  One of the reasons for business class travel is to avoid hanging around busy airports for hours in between flights with no where to go.

‚Ä¢	We asked the cabin crew to explain the normal course of action under such circumstances. The cabin crew were vague and would not give any answer to a very reasonable question. 
‚Ä¢	A representative from Emirates (a dispatcher ?) boarded the aircraft and announced over the PA that ‚Äú300 hotel rooms‚Äù had been secured for the passengers. This later proved to be untrue.
‚Ä¢	The representative explained that all passengers should disembark and that once through immigration, the allocation of hotel rooms would commence however this would take some time to process. This later proved to be untrue.
‚Ä¢	The passengers were herded into the unheated arrivals hall. No representative was there to meet us and the one open desk (Transavia) did their best to explain that the situation was not theirs to handle. All crew from the flight had disappeared, leaving the passengers to fend for themselves.
‚Ä¢	The representative finally arrived and announced that all airport hotels were fully booked. This later proved to be untrue.
‚Ä¢	The scene descended into chaos and the representative refused to answer my question on his earlier statement that the flight had been allocated 300 hotel rooms.
‚Ä¢	The representative announced that passengers should call anyone they knew within travelling distance of the airport and make private arrangements. This was after midnight, and quite frankly, absurd.
‚Ä¢	The representative announced that passengers should keep all receipts and would be reimbursed for reasonable expenses by Emirates.
‚Ä¢	As we had been told that there was no accommodation in any airport hotel, we took a taxi to a nearby town in search of accommodation. As many hours had passed since we had been misled on the availability of accommodation, booking and finding a hotel was extremely difficult at 1:00 am.
‚Ä¢	We returned to the vicinity of Schiphol and found that the Ibis airport hotel had several available rooms.
‚Ä¢	When we checked in for the flight to Gatwick, we were each presented with a boarding card and were told that the bar code was exchangeable for food and drink to the value of 36 Euros. We found that almost no food outlet would accept the bar code and that we should have been issued with a refundable voucher. Surely your staff should know the procedure.
‚Ä¢	We spoke to other passengers who were boarding the flight. They were forced to sleep on the floor and some passengers had videos of vermin running across the concourse. Emirates provided water and nappies for infants however the passengers were left to camp out on a hard floor with minimal heating. The outside temperature was close to freezing hence the aircraft was de-iced when it eventually departed after 19:00 the following day.

The weather event is by no means unusual and is to be expected on several days each winter. The actions of the flight deck crew were as expected although I was surprised at the short duration of the hold. Given the predicted weather, I would have expected there to be a significant amount of contingency fuel beyond the statutory minima. What is unacceptable is the inability of the cabin crew to answer a reasonable question, the blatant falsehoods stated by an Emirates employee, the extensive delays in the truth emerging and that this made it impossible for passengers to book accommodation online. We tried this many times but no hotel would accept an online on-the-day booking after midnight.

Shocking."

I asked if I can check in the suitcase instead but they did not allow me because I had electronic toys for my son with batteries. So I was forced to damage my items just to squeeze my personal bag inside. I did not argue just did what I was told but than after packing I saw woman's entering the plane with handbags and backpacks without being told to hide them in the carry on. When I asked the same person why those womans can have more than one bag she replied """"womans are allowed more than man"""" so I followed up asking if emirates has a policy to discriminate people for being a man and she just told me if I don't like it I don't have to fly and I can complain to customer service. After that I did complain about this situation to the customer service but they ignored my complain without even properly apologising for rudeness and discrimination of their crew members. That was rhe most annoying issue I expected with them but it is very common for this airline to lose a suitcase or change your pre booked seat without giving any reason whatsoever.

On all flights the service was very good, air crew friendly and helpful, and the aircraft clean. There is a little more leg room compared to a lot of the other airlines. However the seats are narrow.

On the first leg we were able to change our allocated seats. Sadly we were not able to do this for the other 3 flights. Allocation didn't make sense. A few people had whole rows of 3/4 seats to themselves and others rows were full.

The most disappointing thing was the food. We had requested vegetarian meals for both of us but were given vegan food on all flights, even after telling air crew and check in staff several times. Each time we were told that it said vegetarian on their system! Yet we were given vegan each time! All the vegan meals were bland and some were just awful. What I couldn't understand was that the tasty vegetarian options quite often didn't have dairy products and we're vegan friendly so why not give the same? Very strange.
Similarly the non-vegetarian meals had things that were vegetarian friendly so why not keep those the same??

I got on the plane in the afternoon in CPH and I knew we would arrive in the middle of the night in Dubai, so it made sense to sleep mostly on that first 6 hour flight, and only sleep a little on the next 10 hour flight, since I knew I would arrive in th evening in Tokyo - but it was impossible, since I wasn't allowed to open the blinds at any time during the second flight. even towards the end of the flight, I was still asked to close it, and the inside of the plane was on """"night mode"""" for the entire flight, so it was hard to reset my circadian rhythm without the sun or light therapy.

Our hotel on jumeirah beach, JBH was stated as having ‚Äúa little construction noise in place‚Äù. Not only was this a complete understatement but additionally the smell of smoke in our hotel room was shocking. The construction work operated on a 24/7 basis and machinery vibrations could be felt throughout our room morning, noon and night. We requested a room move only to be greeted with the same issue. We then had to take a room without balcony in order to alleviate the smell of smoke. The concierge team took 2 days to reply to our requests and in the meantime emirates took 2 days to provide a hotel move as well as well as 7 hours of phone calls and countless emails. The first 2 days of our honeymoon in dubai were completely wasted.

Whilst Jumeirah worked to accommodate our hotel move, Emirates holidays did not.

They continually referenced their supplier and informed me that they needed to speak with the supplier. This was their job not mine but inevitably I had to contact their supplier Juliana directly myself. The refund they offered for JBH was half of the amount we paid despite the nights being unused. 

We lost 2 days of our honeymoon and eventually booked our own return flights home due to emirates lack of service, countless hours on the phone and emirates inability to extend our trip.

3.03130698204041,8.31415557861328,"Emirates Refund Issues",1,"Emirates is rapidly becoming the worst airline in the world (having once been among the best). I have been flying Emirates for 15 years and was a gold member for much of that time. From 2007 - 2012 their customer service was almost unmatched but things have been getting worse over the past 10 years or so and now I would say it is the worst of any airline in the world, including low cost airlines. 

From using emirates exclusively in the past, I now try to avoid them like the plague. I have flown Emirates 3 times this year out of necessity and each time it has been a complete disaster. 

Emirates has now switched from operating like a typical full service carrier to something more akin to a low-cost airline. Not only do they have 4 fare classes (economy, premium, business & first) but each of those classes is split into 4 types (special, saver, flex & flex-plus). The saver fares usually look too good to be true...because they are!

If you find a low price on a special or saver fare when booking in advance you may think you got a good deal but try to make any changes to the flight and you will soon find that the airline tries to gauge you for extortionate 'fare differences'. Even if you try to change your flight to one that costs exactly the same as the flight you are on and there are empty seats in your fare class, they will tell you that your 'fare type' is no longer available and extort you for hundreds if not thousands of dollars to make the change. 

Even if the flight you're on is full and the flight you want to switch to is half empty (something you think the airline would be glad of) they still try to gauge you. If you're lucky enough to get through to customer service, they will not offer you any assistance whatsoever - their job is just to extract as much extra cash from you as they can. I have come to expect this and so avoid Emirates where I can. 

My latest experience with Emirates customer service was far worse than my already very low expectations. I tried to use the Emirates app to make a change to the flight time. I had a Saver fair so there was a change fee of ¬£100. This was clearly stated in the terms and conditions of the ticket so I was happy to pay. However, when I got to the screen to put in my credit card details, the app crashed. I tried again and the same thing happened. 

Rather than keep trying to work with a defective app, I called the airline to make the change over the phone. A recorded message said that the airline was extremely busy and that if I was not flying in the next 48 hours, I should hang up and call back later. I complied with this request and hung up the call. 

As soon as I got back to my hotel room, I got on the laptop to make the change. despite only being a couple of hours later, there was suddenly a 'fare difference' to pay. Since it was the Emirates app that had failed when I tried to make the change and since their call center was too busy to take my call at that time, I was sure that Emirates would do the right thing and match the price from when I had first attempted the change. I thought wrong!

I spoke to a hopeless fist line call center worker who could not help so I asked to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor said that he did not have any authority to make changes to flights, despite the fact that he told me that he was the most senior person in the airline I could speak to. Eventually, I was put through to another man, called Samir Malik, a second level supervisor (or """"officer"""") who also told me he was the most senior person. 

At this point I thought I had finally got through to someone who could make a decision but he also told me he did not have nay authority to make changes to flights. He said he would speak to his manager and call me back with a resolution. About an hour later, he called back and said again that he did not have any authority to change the flight. I asked to speak to his manager and then things got very confusing as he alternated between telling me that he was the most senior person to then telling me that he he had no authority and had to get permission from his manager. 

After a total of two hours on the phone and a complete refusal by Samir to put me through to his manager, I asked what else I could do. Nothing was the answer from Samir. Despite acknowledging that this was Emirates mistake, it was just tough luck as he had no authority. 

Is this really what Emirates calls good customer service from a second level supervisor. I quite frankly find it pathetic. I am refusing to pay the additional charges when the mistake is theirs so I am yet to find out how this plays out. I am holding on to a tiny amount of hope that Emirates will do the right thing and call me back to resolve this before it's too late. Let see..."

There was a thunderstorm over KLIA which started sometime during the night of Sunday 30 October and continued way past midnight. It must have been massive because when I entered the aircraft door reserved for FC/BC passengers, I noticed the galley floor was wet with a pool of water. The crew had used towels to soak up the water and cover the floor. After taking my seat, as a habit, I removed my shoes and used the complimentary socks. When I went to the toilet, I discovered to my horror that it similarly had a pool of water and my socks were all soaked. A cabin crew confirmed that the storm had caused the flooding.

The flight departed KLIA almost an hour later than scheduled but we were not told the reasons for the delay other than the standard lip service apology from the Captain. My connecting flight from Dubai to Geneva was on EK89 and it departed and arrived on schedule.

I reached home from Geneva airport around 2pm on Monday 31 October. I started unpacking about an hour later and was shocked to discover that almost all the contents (clothes/books/medication) in my three (3) checked-in suitcases were wet, stained and some were still soaked in water. 

Notwithstanding the usual terms and conditions governing the baggage policy, Emirates has a duty of care to its passengers. It has to ensure that either its employees or employees of your service providers who provide various airport services take the necessary, proper and reasonable steps to ensure that the contents of the passengers‚Äô luggage are not damaged in any way by their reckless behavior.  

This obviously must have happened in Kuala Lumpur during the thunderstorm: either during the time the luggage was being loaded into the baggage containers from the baggage carousel or when it was being loaded onto the aircraft. It was irresponsible behavior of the baggage service providers. 

The wonderful in-flight service on board and the flight as a whole (despite the very late departure) was marred by this incident.

 No lines or sign posting for business class boarding was visible.

I cannot fault the cabin crew.

I emailed EK on my return (their feednack form wouldnt load so got the email from their FB staff)
Waited over 20 days after hearing nothing.

After a horrendous flight from Birmingham to Dubai, EK040 earlier, whereby I was seated (36D) next to one of the biggest men I've ever seen, and having to remind him constantly that his bare arm was in my seat space and having to put up with the odour from his open armpit, I was hoping for something better on the next leg of my journey. A journey of 20 hours, after a stop in Dubai for 8 hours which turned into 10 hours because of delays. I was now sat in my window seat (33A) and hoping for a good flight with lots of rest. The seating in Dubai airport isn't exactly passenger friendly. 5 minutes passed, ten minutes, fifteen minutes, I thought, 'this is excellent, I might have a comfortable flight'. The seat next to mine and indeed the aisle seat were still vacant. My happiness didn't last much longer. An absolute giant of a man entered the cabin, my immediate thought was that he was going to be my travel companion for the next 20 hours. I was correct in my thinking. He was in the middle seat. This is definitely the biggest man I've ever seen. The chap on the previous flight pales into insignificance compared to this chap. Then a lady took up the aisle seat, that's it I thought, this isn't going to be very good. This man was so big that whilst sitting back in his seat, his face was almost touching the video screen in the seat back in front of him. He was so big that half his body was in my seat space and the lady on the end had the same problem, she too had lost half of her seat area. And once again I was faced with having a bare arm and excruciating smelly armpit level with my nostrils. There was nothing I could do about it. There were no more seats on this aircraft, I did look around. So, there I was crammed into the window seat, totally unable to move, even when we were served meals the hostess had to pass my food tray over the heads of the passengers in front of us, this man was so huge. During the flight, I couldn't even see the aisle due to his size, therefore absolutely unable to request water or other beverages when the hostesses passed, as I couldn't see them or the aisle. I had to put up with this for 20 hours, being a sufferer of DVT it was not pleasant in fact it was horrendous. This is the worst flight I have ever been on, and I've been on quite a few, I'm 72 yo. I'm pretty much convinced that Emirates know of this man's size and know full well that they have to put him in a middle seat, thus taking up two seats, half to his left and half to his right. He would never in a million years fit into a window seat, and if he were in an aisle seat, the whole aisle would be blocked. Sorry Emirates, this was definitely the worst flight I've ever been on, and I'm very much convinced you knew all along of the problems with this giant of a man. I did look at business class but that was full, except for the first leg, Birmingham to Dubai. I feel totally let down by Emirates and this disaster of a flight. Zero out of ten.

Emirates MUST know of this man's size, it was patently obvious he was put in to a middle seat for this very same reason. There was no point in complaining to the air hostess as there was absolutely nowhere else to go. We were crammed in like sardines. Furthermore the cost of this flight, stuck in economy, was actually more expensive than my last UK flight in business class. Emirates, you stink!"

I flew from Toronto to Dubai to Mumbai and back.  Paid for seats on all 4 flights.  What a waste of money.  I paid for two """"preferred seats"""" and two """"extra leg room"""" seats on the flights, for a total of C$222.  

I have no idea what was """"preferred"""" about them.  The cabin was full. The seats were the same throughout economy.  Emirates has a unique definition of """"preferred"""" in the English language; it seems to mean """"identical"""".

The """"preferred seats"""" were handed out gratis to all others at check-in.  The flights were full, so about 99% of the passengers in the exactly-the-same """"preferred seats"""" paid nothing.  Zilch.  Nada.  Zero.

Ah, but what about the extra leg-room seats?  Well, on the first flight two people simply moved from their second-row middle seats to the extra leg room seats next to me.  No cost to them; they just moved in clear view of the flight crew.  The flight was not full.

On the second flight, the flight was full.  So my fellow extra leg room companions were just people assigned those seats for free.  Nothing special about them - no children, disability etc.  Maybe they're frequent flyers...

So, my suggestion is if your flight is not full, take the aisle seat right behind the extra-room seat and move as swiftly as possible to the empty extra leg room seat before take-off if there is one.  And if there's someone sitting in one of those seats having paid, just smile at them for having saved your money...."

Usually I'd be stressed but with Emirates reputation, I knew they'd do right by us. I was dead wrong. After spending 2 hours at the customer service counter - which was 1) super inefficient as only one of the two people there was working while the other sat and twiddled her thumbs and 2) incredibly rude - we were left with the option to stay at a motel with no indication of how to cover our taxis or food or anything of the sorts. This was unacceptable considering they were delaying us 24 hours. And I filed a complaint with Emirates directly. They had the audacity to respond """"accommodations were offered but denied"""". 1) They were not - we were told of many hotels and each time told """"oh we can't book that"""". 2) Ultimately we were offered a motel, which is unacceptable for such an expensive airline / flight. 3) To no surprise, the receipts I uploaded for our taxis and food were totally ignored.

Overall, despite this minor issue, I had a positive experience with Emirets and would recommend them to others.
I did book an Emirets ticket online and It was fine and ok ,I have always been a fan of online booking websites because they are so convenient. You can easily compare different airlines and airports, and find the best flight deals without having to leave your home.

1.51643860340118,4.12999057769775,"Emirates Flight Delays",1,"My wife and I were travelling on a business trip to Lisbon from Kolkata. The dates we chose were very important to us as we were to be at Lisbon and, also return to Kolkata on specific dates. Airlines have different fares on different dates and irrespective of high fares we booked our passage on Emirates PAYING EXORBITANT FARE since our travel dates were specific.
The booking reference is NJEN9P departing Kolkata on 10th October 2022 and return journey from Lisbon on 19th October 2022
To make sure that we connect well, we booked Marhaba services both ways to escort us from the arrival gate to the connection departure gates at a fast pace.
On our return journey from Lisbon, we were informed at the check in counter that the departure form Lisbon to Dubai is delayed by 30 minutes due to late arrival of the aircraft. I informed the check in counter that we have a connection to Kolkata and we must be able to avail of the same. We were told not to worry and the Airline shall take care of connection time and that we shall sure catch the flight to Kolkata.
Our baggage was through checked and we were issued Boarding passes for Lisbon- Dubai and Dubai- Kolkata.     
We also kept nudging the flight attendents about our dilemma and they reassured us that we shall be taken care of to Board the connecting flight. We also requested them to message Dubai about the situation and they also assured us.
Our flight reached Dubai at around 120 am on 20th October 2022, about 30 minutes late. I was the first to get off the aircraft and we both ran to the departure gate through the security to reach at around 145 am with the help of Marhaba service. The information screens were showing last call at that time for flight EK 570. Passengers were still boarding the flight and some passengers in fact came after us to the gate.
On presenting our Boarding Pass we were denied Boarding stating that we have been offloaded due to delayed arrival of incoming aircraft. We literally begged of them to take us in. The Emirates staff told us that they cannot since our Boarding pass is not on the system and asked us to go to connections counter for further advise. I repeatedly requested the Boarding Gate staff stating that there is an urgent meeting which I have to attend but they were not moved. I saw the gates close while I was still pleading and at least 15 passengers had boarded the flight after I reached the gate.
I then went on to connections counter. There was no one on the Executive class desk. After a lot of waiting I could attract attention of a staff who told us that our only option is to avail the flight the next day, after 24 hours. In the mean while I could stay at the business class lounge at the airport. I repeatedly requested them to route me through any other Indian city to which their reply was that they can give a connection to another Indian City but not onward to Kolkata, which was my final destination. 
Finally, with a lot of pleading I was able to secure a Boarding pass to the next flight to Delhi. Onward passage to Kolkata was not provided. I had to reach Delhi, clear the immigration, collect my baggage and then proceed to another terminal to take the earliest flight to Kolkata at a very high cost  and a lot of inconvenience.
Later when I checked my mail, I saw that I was issued fresh Boarding Pass for the next day flight form Dubai to Kolkata by email soon after take off of the flight from Lisbon to Dubai.

My question is:
1.	Why did Emirate not inform me of their decision to offload me from the Dubai Kolkata flight while I was checking in? I could have looked at alternative connections and in a worst case scenario opted to stay at Lisbon instead of staying in the lounge at Dubai for 24 hours. 
2.	Why were we denied Boarding despite reaching the gate while other passengers were still Boarding and the last call was made on the information screen. On my enquiry at Emirates gate, we were told that these passengers had informed in advance. I had also informed in advance to all Emirates staff who came my way
3.	Does on time arrival mean on time arrival of only the aircraft or the passengers also
4.	Why was I misguided at Lisbon by Emirates staff and not given the next best alternatives
5.	Emirates had contracted to reach us at Kolkata on a given date, not to pick us up from Lisbon and dump us at Dubai. I hire a transport to take me form point to point, on Business Class as per a schedule and I was dumped midway. Why?]  
6.	Why did Emirates not reroute me through another Indian city in proper time and give me a connection up to Kolkata. The contract for carriage was up to Kolkata for a given date and time"

The ticketing officer in Emirates Jumeirah office was kind enough to advice me what route I should use to get to Panama since there was no direct flights.  He assured me that being Kenyan i would transit through Brazil which was only 8 hrs without a problem... So I proceeded to pay AED 13,846 for my return flight. The day came which was 20th October 2022 went to check in and I was immediately flagged! Treated like someone who made a crime... I had the reservation letter... I had my invitation letter which was approved...  I had the wedding venue receipt cause we paid on advance and all it took for this woman to say no to me was have one look at my passport. She had the audacity to tell me I haven't given her enough proof and that she is sure I will stay in Brazil.  This Emirates lady was so rude and arrogant asking me questions about Brazil which of course I don't know I have never been and wasn't interested in the country my country of interest was panama. She didn't even ask if I was okay with her cancelling my ticket. All she said you are not allowed to board Emirates flight ever in your life... Shocked and my jaw dropped because the reason I flew with Emirates was because they offer good service..... When I called customer care they too were confused why I was denied entry if I had all the proof all she kept saying is I didn't have enough documents which was a lie. So I went to a help desk was ND this guy I talked to who was Emirates stuff told me because I'm a 26 year old Kenyan lady I got flagged from the moment they saw me. To them I didn't meet the standards and he told me only if you were traveling with a white man would I have been allowed to board the flight. My Day wasted....  That was how I first handed experienced the worst day of my life and racism for the first time. I have called... I have complained but my plea fell on deaf ears... So please don't make the same mistake as I did of being an African and going to Panama through Emirates... They don't like black young Africans in their flight cause their reasoning is we are either going to sell  drugs or being whores

Travelling home to my fathers funeral, I arrived with more than three hours before the flight. I was refused entry to my flight because of an error made by check-in staff regarding covid test requirements which I had double checked for my transit airport and destination. As a traveller who is a New Zealand citizen  I knew I didn't need to have a test before my flight. I had filled in my compulsory NZ Citizen Travel Declaration whereby tests happen in NZ on arrival because pre flight LFT's are considered valid for only 24 hrs and you arrive in NZ after that time is up. A negative test was not required for transit in Dubai either at this time, however, I was sent for a test. If you haven't booked in advance the test is almost double the pre booked charge. When I came back to the desk,  check-in had closed early due to lack of security staff upstairs. They knew that anyone checking in at that point would not get through in time to board the flight. I nearly fainted. I was sent away to re-book online but was eventually allowed to re-book using an Emirates staff phone (and to pay over the phone) because no one was answering at the booking office and online, flights appeared to be unavailable for the following day. Over the staff phone I was somehow found and sold a ticket for the next evening but it was 24 hours away and I had to travel back home for the night. That night back at home I realised that the flight I had been sold also had a 24 hr stop over in Dubai (not 2 hrs as in my original booking) so I now needed a hotel, as regulations state that 24hrs or more in Dubai airport are not allowed - you have to go to accommodation. I also had to go onto the domestic airline website in my home country and pay to change my connecting flights. When I returned next day with a second 'required' test result (they are considered only valid for 24hrs), the check-in staff were better informed and knew they didn't need to see any test results. They didn't even want to see my vaccination pass and not in Dubai airport either.  I spent the 24 hours shut in my hotel room in Dubai worrying about not passing any tests I may have to take the next day. All of this resulted in my time with family in New Zealand (at a very, very sad time indeed) being reduced by around 3 precious days and further stress was caused by all of the added expense as if my original last minute flight booking wasn't expensive enough! All of this hassle was clearly unnecessary. Emirates have refused to acknowledge their part in my distressing experience nor to offer something other than """"Sorry you had a difficult time"""". I feel that the flight, tests, transport, domestic re-bookings and Dubai accommodation should be refunded by Emirates Airlines. I doubt they can do anything about the worry and stress caused. I've ticked 'Business' in the next box about what kind of trip it was because it sure wasn't 'Leisure'."

But the last 2 trips in November 2021 and the trips in October 2022 to Dubai and Srilanka has been  very poor in standard and  customer services in the Economy sections, always the 1st thing the hostesses use to give us hot towels no more, Tea/coffee no more , main meals poorvin standard, infkights entertainment selection of B grade movies when once it was latest A grade movies, NO offering of water or soft drinks, or savouries,  Even against our wishes they have chosen in all the 4 trips seats which we are not happy at all as i sneed seats near the window and to do so like cheap Airlines Emirates are asking for more money. Shame on them, I am afraid being a frequent traveller and from other fellow travellers the feed back I am getting is flights like Etihad , Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines are way  ahead of Emirates. They need to get their acts together and be no.1 again as they used to be.

The fact that this didn't happen, I infer that this racism by passenger was allowed as the crew is within its powers to insist on the seat pulled up and allow reasonable adjustments.

After a couple of weeks, the connection flight Sao Paulo-Navegantes had been suspended according to the Emirates app. I called Emirates as the recommendation asking for a solution and I had been informed that I could choose staying an extra day in Dubai to get the flight on Thursday early morning instead of Wednesday night, or getting the next available flight in Sao Paulo that would be next day at 6:30am. I doubled check the information and asked if I could decide and call back later after checking for accomodation purposes in Dubai, where the answer was positive. When I called Emirates back a few days later, the attendant was extremely rude, not friendly at all, saying that the first information given by Emirates was wrong and I couldn‚Äôt change the flight without paying extras that could vary between $200 and $2000. That said, there was not really a choice to be made and I decided to change the connection flight to Navegantes to the next day, which means that I was waiting at the airport for 14 hours. When I arrived in Sao Paulo I was informed that my flight was also changed from one airport to another (Guarulhos Airport to Congonhas Airport) but at any time the attendent that changed my flight mentioned it, and it means that I needed to pay for accomodation at the airport (the flight arrived at 4:30pm) and also I needed to pay for the transfer to the correct airport at 3am in a very unsafe city.
At the end, my trip turned into a big nightmare and I needed to spent a very reasonable amount to fix the issues caused by Emirates.

 the 2 shelves by the floor for your feet on the top, and minimal on the bottom.

We always do carry-on luggage.  Their luggage guidelines do not accommodate ‚Äúnormal‚Äù roller bags, which we have used on every airline.

After contacting Emirates, they told us that our booking doesn't, didn't and never existed which was a lie (email & bookings to prove etc). Eventually, our rep managed to book us on to new flights, but we arrived back in the UK 24 hours later than planned which affected our working lives.

So when we arrived in Dubai, they told us to choose ‚Äòin like 30 seconds‚Äô if we want to try to catch our next flight but forget about our luggage, or to wait 4 hours for the next flight to go w our luggage. We asked questions like ‚Äòwhen my luggage arrive if I go now or should I go to the airport to collect them?‚Äô; but they were not answered ‚Äòcause ladies started YELLING at us sayin they don know the answers, we gonna see when we go.

And then later we tried to confirm that we gonna go w our luggages and also we have been told that we have to go and recheck the bags cause even though they said bags gonna be transferred to Istanbul, sometimes it is not. So we went to Emirates transfer desk. The lady there, was on the phone and we were the next on the line. She called us by hand gesture and then requested our tickets by hand gesture again but she was still talking on the phone so we waited quietly.

I  was one of the first in the checkin counter before 10am on 27th Sep.  After I showed my vaccination record & green QR code issued by HKSAR, I was asked for PCR test result. I was shocked - a top airline that flies to HKG failed to instantly update frontline staff with latest requirements announced by HKSAR government on 23 Sep!  I showed photo of RAT test I did the night before but was rejected.  The 2 ground staffers passed me to Ms Buckley, from there my ordeal began until I was onboard.  Instead of helping passengers, she tortures them.  I explained patiently by showing her HKSAR website, pointed at the paragraph that says """"RAT (can be self-administered or by professional swab sampling)"""".  She read it few times but I wasn't convinced she understood that paragraph written in simple plain English.  I had a new RAT test kit with me & offered to do it in front of her, she refused & insisted I must do it at testing centre in terminal 2. From 10am to 11:45, I explained many times, she made me wait while she claimed to seek directives from elsewhere.  If she had sought clarification from Emirates HK office, she would have got the answer.  After over 1.5 hours, I was allowed to checkin but issued only boarding pass to Dubai.  She said I would be met by ground staff when landed in Dubai, do RAT test, wait for result before issued a boarding pass to HK.  After almost 2 hours of mental & physical stress, I agreed. Suddenly she went after me, snatched the boarding pass from my hand, demanded I must do RAT test in terminal 2.  I said you had no right to """"steal"""" my boarding pass.  There was a male ground staff who looked senior next to her, supported her behaviour. I felt bullied as there was no sanity or professionalism demonstrated by these 2 human figures.  As time ran out I had no choice unless I gave up that flight, I walked with tears & my heavy bags to terminal 2 for RAT test which costed ¬£35. I rushed back with """"negative"""" result in an email, even then she was not satisfied, she demanded to see result report in pdf which caused further few minutes delay. Finally she gave me boarding passes. During the 2+ hours of ordeal, she told me checkin counter closed at 1pm, my flight is 2pm, I still had time. If I had listened to her, I would have missed my flight as it took me 80 mins to go through security checks.  I ran to the gate as it was closing in 5 mins. I met other passengers at Dubai boarding gate (from Dubin and Milan), they were rejected first but after fighting they got on.

The the seats; so many were broken, including food tables, it‚Äôs a worrying thought that if the management allow such shoddy maintenance on in the cabin does this follow on the engineering maintenance??? the food was mediocre; rock hard inedible bread rolls, cheap packets of biscuits, positively cheap tasteless rubbish. the service was absolutely terrible, uncaring inefficient and a total worrying lack of regard to safety - no walk through prior to landing, most of the rear cabin landed with seats reclined arm rests back and no seat belts - I think the local bus driver cares more. The entire flight was a sad endurance, not even an apology from the pilot for being 45 minutes late. 
Emirates bears no resemblance to what it used to be like. I would absolutely not recommend this airline fly at your peril."

The horizontal section of the seat had a lump in middle and sloped forward so that there was no back support.  Waiting for the flight to taxi, take off and attain sufficient height before being able to recline the seat to ease the pressure on my lower back was extremely uncomfortable.  As soon as I was able to do so, I requested a mattress but one was not sufficient to solve the problem and it wasn't until I obtained a second one that a degree of comfort was achieved.  Then of course the discomfort was repeated at the end of the flight because they took the mattresses away in preparation for landing.
As an older person, I travelled with Emirates for the convenience of the chauffeur service at each end, but this does not compensate for the extreme discomfort of the seat.  Using older planes with sub-standard seating is not what I expected of Emirates and paying $11k+ for it is unacceptable.  Never again."

Free masks and sanitisers are welcome. However, some staff shied away from asking passengers to keep their masks on once in the air.

We were able to change seats just before departure, but it was a 3-seater in row 17, which has limited legroom (wall in front) and a significantly worse position with both monitor and table placed in the armrests and no seat in front to place anything underneath. We pay a lot for a location that is not randomly chosen precisely because we know where we want to sit and definitely not sit. At least we got to both watch and listen to movies, but the flight was far from pleasant and certainly not worth the money. This 777-300 aircraft definitely needs some love and care, does not meet the same standard we have been used to at Emirates. Our departure was in August, and when we also had problems on the way from DXB to OSL in September with the same type of aircraft, I know that this was a trip that cost much more than it was worth. On the return journey, the monitor (Seat 47A) stopped working, it went black and remained black for the last 2 hours of the flight, it could not be fixed and no more movies could be watched on it. It should be added that she who was responsible for the flight attendants made several attempts and gave us something extra to read on, as well as something good to drink - she behaved as we have been used to in the past, provided very good service, thank you Ms/Mrs """"H...something"""".

To Whom it May Concern,

I am writing this letter of complaint to document an egregious show of accountability, empathy, and lack of process by Emirates‚Äô call center team and management.

My finance and I are traveling with Emirates for the first time with her entire immediate family (Mother, Father, Sister) to celebrate Dashain. We were informed that her ‚ÄúAunt‚Äù (Father‚Äôs sister) the matriarch of the family passed on 9/02/22. This is the same person who supported my fianc√©e and her family to come to the US and the main reason we were visiting India. 

My fianc√©e and I called Emirates to modify our flights to spend more time with family while overseas. During our first call Representative 1 recommended that we should fill out the refund form and cancel our original flights since my fianc√© identified cheaper ticket prices with Emirates and this qualified as a cancellation fee waiver due to death of a close family member:
 
We ended the call feeling relived and booked new itinerary. Upon filing out the refund-request form, we couldn‚Äôt complete parts of it, so had to call back and speak to Representative 2. This is where we learned that Aunt isn‚Äôt considered a close family member but couldn‚Äôt rebut the fact that nothing on the form defined close family. After 30 minutes of not acknowledging the guidance we received from representative 1, after putting us on hold for several minutes without new insight or outputs, we requested to speak to a manager. We couldn‚Äôt speak to a manager immediately and had to wait til the next morning. 
	
We spoke to manager Kartik (Employee # 597086), who was cold and calculating. He even questioned as to why I was calling and that my tickets wouldn‚Äôt be refunded since ‚ÄúI am not technically family.‚Äù I informed him that it wasn‚Äôt my choice to call and that this administrative task is the best I can do since my fianc√©e and her family are grieving (in their culture all celebrations are halted due to death for a year, its only been five days). We started to go down each scenario one by one as to why my fianc√©e and my tickets will not be refunded despite the entire family traveling together. I even inquired about my fiancee‚Äô mother meeting the requirements and what if she called to make the necessary adjustments, could we then qualify for the fee waiver. He brushed my questions aside and just said no matter what you do, you will be charged the total amount of the cancelation fee and that they have it listed in their system already. 

While Kartik is good for business, I will take my business and the business of all of my friends and family elsewhere due to this experience. He ended the call reminding me that despite our entire conversation, I still had to submit the refund form because he doesn‚Äôt have the capability to submit this on the back end, a capability most airlines can do on behalf of their clients. 

It is unfortunate that my first time to India on top of death, can be met with such lack of accountability, empathy, and process by Emirates‚Äô. It is clear the representatives working on behalf of Emirates lacked the ability to showcase the values you set forth on your company page:
 
‚Ä¢	Excellence ‚Äì in everything we do. 
‚Ä¢	Agility ‚Äì move as one, with the impact of thousands.
‚Ä¢	Innovation ‚Äì remain ahead of the game.

The issue is, Emirates flights timing is not as convenient as it used to be. I wanted to fly back in the evening time but there are no flights. So I had to book it on fly dubai (FZ0025 on September 5) and this was a big mistake. 

Apart from the fact the I am a gold member in Emirates, I did not enjoy enogh benefits on fly dubai. We had many many issues and will list them here:
1. We had to stand up the bus between the airport and the plane for around 25 mins. People got upset and started asking the security personnel to open the doors (No social distancing, no ventilation ‚Ä¶etc).
2. The flight was delayed for around 90 mins while we are waiting in the plan.
3. No priority for Gold members during Boarding

I know this may have nothing to do with Emirates management, but the fact that some timing is only available with flydubai may not be convenient for some travellers (including me!)"

We tried to contact Emirates officials to report this; however, we were informed by the baggage facility officer in the airport that the Emirates office in the Airport doesn‚Äôt operate after 5pm and we had been given a form to fill up and upload online. The damaged harmonium was one of the presents I got from my father who passed away last year due to Covid. I am shocked to see it is broken into pieces. I am also very disappointed with the attitude of Emirates staff in Dhaka Airport. I was explaining to them that the harmonium needs to be handled carefully but the staff did not listen to me, she was handling the luggage carelessly and she replied that this is the way they handle all passengers‚Äô luggage. I was shocked to see such rude behavior from a staff who belongs to a reputed airlines like Emirates. We choose to fly with Emirates due to their good reputation; however, it is a shame to see such rude behavior from an Emirate staff in Dhaka airport.

Soft drinks are not offered during breakfast. During this 16 hour flight, there was zero drink runs. The crew did set up a drink counter in the galley. Now on a fully packed A380, if you are seated in a window seat, this is a challenge as you need to cross 2 other passengers if you want a drink. 

I was completely overlooked by the Supervisor who was serving the refreshment snack just before landing. Usually I would overlook this, but on this flight I was really hungry. I pressed the call button for nearly 40 minutes and no crew bothered to attend to me. The crew saw my call light but decided that it was more prudent to complete the inflight sales.

At Mumbai airport, they registered the complaint; approved the claim then were silent. Three months later, I was taking my return flight from same airport so could speak to them face to face. They had no clue what to do there as they were Emirates contractors. 
At Dubai, they were asking me to talk to the baggage department which is outside the immigration (wanted me to take visa only for this conversation). We could not do that as we had my US flight in few hours. After returning to US (At Miami), we realized that another luggage is broken. This time, they failed to register a formal complaint. Over the phone, they confirmed that it is not a loss for them. I am figuring out how to use those broken luggages now. #Cheating #Frustrating #Signpetition #BanEmirates.

I'm submitting this complaint as I should have been advised this option to utilise my points for Business Class upgrades when looking to book my flights - As the website was down (still down/doesn't show options) and I had no other way to tell and even asked multiple times the representative """"How can I get my upgrade? What can I do to increase my chances? Is there anything else I can do?"""" and not ONCE was this mentioned. Should I have known this on booking day, that I can pay my flights with cash and use my points for upgrade that's exactly what I would have done! As such, I am requesting that my flights be updated to reflect as such that I wanted on Day 1.

After such back and forth, a supervisor called me back the next day.  The supervisor also agreed and acknowledged that the representative did not provide all the options at the time of booking and without a viable working Emirates website, how am I to know the options to make an informed decision? I could only act on the information provided - which the supervisor did advise lacked all the options. The supervisor also agreed and acknowledged that I mentioned the website was not working at the time I called in to book. Supervisor told me to email him all my screenshots of the Emirates glitch and issue - which I did that day & got no reply. Supervisor also told me to lodge a formal complaint via Emirates - which I also did that day and also got no reply.

Simply wanting to refund my flights in full, simply so that I can REBOOK both of my legs to be flexi fares and have my points returned - I am being asked for the $1,000 cancellation fee. A fee that I am being incurred because an Emirates representative was not able to provide all of the information upfront? A fee that is your internal fee, and I am rebooking with you on the same call. A fee that I am told could have been waived in the first 48 hours but because I called on the 3rd day, is it no longer viable? BY THE WAY, I only found out after 2 weeks of chasing that it could have been refundable prior - the second representative also did not advise of this.

This is how they reward loyalty.

With the fast changing Covid protocols we had a slight hiccup at check in, but it was remedied by a very professional staff and we were on our way to the Business Lounge following a painless security screening with TSA pre-check. The Emirates Business Lounge is very spacious and was pretty empty when we arrived on a Sunday morning. The lounge was very clean and the staff very attentive. There was a nice offering of breakfast foods, including chicken sausage, potatoes, salads, bean dishes and a variety of baked goods. 

One of the best features of the Business Lounge is that business class passengers can board directly from the lounge. 

Once onboard, my wife and I had seats in one of the two seat configurations located in the odd rows which is perfect for couples.  The two seat configuration in the even rows provide more privacy.

The service started right away‚Äîjuice or champagne; mattress installed with blanket and pillow. Each seat came with a couple of bottles of still water, a bottle of Perrier, a can of Pepsi and a can of 7up. Nuts were provided and lunch orders were taken. The flight crew was friendly and accommodating. 

The food on the flight was quite good. I wanted to get an early start on the traditional dishes I would be enjoying so I had the traditional Arabic mezze and prawn machbous for lunch. A couple of hours before landing, breakfast orders were taken and served very efficiently. I had the scrambled eggs with chives that was accompanied by chicken sausage, hash browns and mushrooms. 

Our return flight was just as outstanding with delicious food and excellent service.

Both flights included Bvlgari amenity kits for men and women. The kits were lovely, durable, attractive cases that included dental kits, lotion, fragrances (cologne for men, perfume for women), deodorant, lip balm, tissues and in the men‚Äôs kit, shaving cream and a razor. 

Flying in Emirates Business Class makes a 13-14 hour flight go very quickly. Noise cancelling headphones are provided for the flight and there is a generous offering of entertainment on the ICE system. The lay flat seats were very comfortable and I was able to sleep well during the flight.

As someone who has flown in Emirates economy class (and found it to be far superior to virtually all of its competitors world-wide) I have a great appreciation for the quality of their business class and similarly find their business class outshines the majority of its competitors world-wide.

Well, something did go wrong with two of our four flights an Emirates failed abysmally to get anything right. And of course, the don't care!
I booked a return business class flight to the Seychelles from London Heathrow (booking ref MKEIGW). The outbound journey went to plan but the return journey had severe problems. This booking was made directly on the Emirates website.
The flight home to LHR was on 17 Aug 22 flight numbers EK706,(Mahe to Dubai) and the connecting flight was EK003 (Dubai to LHR). We arrived at Mahe airport in good time for the flight and went to the VIP lounge. 
About an hour before flight EK706 was due to take off we received a text/email telling us that, instead of departing at 08.15 local time the flight had been delayed to 14.00. No further explanation was given. On enquiring at the desk, after much delay whilst the staff in the lounge tried to locate the Emirates rep, we were told that the inbound flight had been diverted to Mauritius because the pilot thought the winds at Mahe airport were too strong. Therefore, there was no aircraft for our flight. Quite why the pilot had this problem on the least windy day that we had on the island during our stay we do not know. Certainly the Air Seychelles, Etihad and Qatar flights that came in around the same time had no such problem. All of this meant that we would miss our connection in Dubai. Eventually we received a text/email to say that we had been put on the LHR flight 24 hours after our original flight. We enquired why we were not being put on one of the four earlier flights or an alternate flight with another airline but were told by the Emirates rep that she did not know. However, we asked her to send an email to Dubai and we were eventually given seats on an earlier flight. She also did not know what arrangements were being made for us in Dubai. Very little information was being relayed to her from your HQ in Dubai.
Our flight to Dubai eventually took off 7 hours late. Despite the amount of time that Emirates had to sort out the details for all connecting passengers, the treatment of us at Dubai was a total and complete shambles. No announcement was made on the plane as to what to do when we disembarked, apart from a pop up on the seatback screen telling us that the Emirates flight to LHR (flight 003) would be departing at 14.15! It was now 18.20hrs! After leaving the plane, we were making our way towards connections as we didn‚Äôt know any better, and were grabbed by an Emirates employee who asked if we had a connecting flight. He directed us to someone who swapped our now useless boarding passes for the flight that had left many hours previously, for new passes for our replacement flight, but again, no further information was given. Someone eventually told us that we had to go to a desk they called 'Hotel Arrivals' and just pointed straight ahead. We ended up at immigration not knowing whether we would be allowed into Dubai due to visa and covid restrictions, but were allowed through by the immigration officer on duty. We then didn't know whether we were supposed to pick up our bags or not as once again Emirates had failed to to tell us. We stood at the baggage claim until a sign came up saying all the bags had been delivered. But ours was not there. We noticed a baggage enquiry desk and actually found an Emirates employee who appeared to know what he was doing - the first time we had found a member of your staff at Dubai who was actually friendly and helpful. He looked up on the computer and confirmed that the bags would be transferred straight to our flight the following day. We therefore had to make do with the clothing we had worn all day and with no bathroom items like toothbrushes or razor. Despite being business class passengers, apparently no amenity kits are given out on daytime flights, even if you know that the passengers are going to be delayed overnight! Eventually we were transferred to a hotel for our overnight stay, but not to an airport hotel but one that was 25 minutes away. Not so good when we had to be picked up at 05.15. On arrival at reception, after a wait for a receptionist to become free, we were told that Emirates had a desk that we should go to in order to check in, rather than queueing at the main reception desks. Once again, no-one from Emirates had bothered to give us this information. The lady at this desk told us that we could have a meal in the buffet cafe but when asked whether we could have room service (we were extremely tired by this stage) we were told this would not be covered by Emirates. We eventually made it back to London after a long, exhausting journey lasting almost 36 hours. During this time we had one apology from the pilot of the delayed flight to Dubai. No-one else seemed to care in the least. No-one at Dubai airport, apart from the man in the baggage office, seemed to have a clue what information should be given to us about the fact that Emirates had caused us to miss our connection. In fact, no-one seemed to have received any training at all. We had a hotel booking at LHR for 17th Aug which was non-cancellable. We have lost our money paid for this booking. We arrived back a day late to pick our car up and have had to pay for an extra day on this. All our plans for the day after we were supposed to arrive home had to be cancelled. I am sure that you do not care in the least about this - we're just the poor unfortunate passengers who thought it would be good to try Emirates for the first time in our lives. Nice planes, shame about the incompetent ground staff. As you can probably guess, this was our first experience of Emirates and we shall make sure it is our last."

The plane was not clean, the bathrooms were filthy half way through the flight and that's how they stayed.

For one of the longest flights in the world Emirates has put zero thought into the comforts and enjoyment for its customers.
Currently they are flying some of their oldest 777-300s with old interiors and very outdated entertainment systems. The screens are tiny and clunky to use. The quality and resolution was low.
For some reason Emirates would use this poor quality offering for their longest route! When they are using their much newer 777s on much shorter flights. That's quite disrespectful for their customers who travel on their ultra longhuals to and from NZ.

To top it off they make a 1.5hr stop mid way through the flight in KL , where they swap out crew, take on some new customers and clean the plane meanwhile existing customers just have to sit there while all this is happening around them!

It's one of the most disappointing long haul flights experiences I've had. I did this trip 8 times this year. Thinking maybe I just had one bad experience...but in my case it was all 8 times!

Not everyone can speak english right? I assume that they can still communicate with everybody through body/hand gestures, like letting them choose if you want water or juice? Meat or fish?

Secondly a rude air hostess then spilled water on my trouser and just asked if I‚Äôm ok didn‚Äôt bring any tissues or anything. My trouser was wet. I then had to deal with being knocked my food trolleys as this was the section where the trolleys had to be loaded . Bare in mind I paid a lot extra for extra leg room! That was being used by trolleys ! What a joke ! The back of the plan leg room should not be extra if this is the case due to the noise disturbance of children, trolleys constantly being loaded in that section and staff sorting the trolleys there and extra noise . I then waited 2 hours for baggage claims ! This flight was horrendous."

Enthusiastic and engaging and constantly offering drinks was really great. Not to mention the A380‚Äôs are incredibly quiet which helps when trying to sleep.

Since the airport is so huge , walking a lot of distances with a baby was very hard. Also not many baby facilities. It really did not feel comfortable. We had to get a buggy once as it was so long to get to the other end of the airport . 
We were transiting and due to Emirates lack of customer service, we had to decline their complimentary hotel booking which meant we had to wait for 2 more hours at the airport. We instead booked the airport hotel on the spot because it was becoming too uncomfortable for us and the baby.

I was horrified with how disorganised the Airlines was in dealing with delays and disgruntled passengers, and I mean ALL passengers, not only me. My flight itinerary which I purchased from Emirates included a sector between Tenerife and Madrid, where I had to fly on Europa Airlines.  My boarding passes for all 3 sectors ( Tenerife-Madrid, Madrid-Dubai, Dubai-Singapore) were issued to me by Europa Airlines in Tenerife. When I landed in Madrid, I was told I could go straight through to security and to the boarding gates. After I did that, I found out on the departure information display, that there was going to be a delay and I had to approach the Emirates counter, which was before security. So, I went out, approached the staff at the reservation and ticketing booth, and was told that the boarding passes I received from Europa Airlines WAS NOT VALID on Emirates!!! I was shocked! How can Emirates have codesharing with another airline and NOT ACCEPT their boarding passes!!! I was told that I had to once again check in in Madrid Airport! I was very upset because the queue at the check in counters were extremely long. The service at the counters were VERY slow, I had to stand in line for 2 1/2 hours to check in AGAIN even when I had boarding passes in my hand!!!! What a nightmare and a disaster!!! As compensation I got a free meal voucher which wasn't even a mea1! It was salad!!!!! Goodness me!!! On board the aircraft, I ordered wine , and got it after ONE hour!! On the other sector, I asked for coffee and did not get it at all! VERY DISAPPOINTING! 
And thats' not all! When I reached Dubai, I missed my connecting flight to Singapore due to the delay in Madrid! FYI, I had paid for extra legroom on all sectors as I have sore knees.  As I missed my flight, they issued me another boarding pass for the Dubai-Singapore sector and the seat they allocated to me was NOT extra legroom seta BUT a normal economy seat in the middle !!! That was the last straw! I lost it!

When I tried to get reimbursed from Emirate, they said it was not possible.  We spent a small fortune that was a huge financial expense.  It was our wedding gift to my son.  To make matters even worse, I had to change my flight as I was hospitalized in Kolkata for 3 days.

Upon arrival in Seattle, my baggage did not arrive. I spoke with the emirates representative there who looked at my border ticket and said ‚Äòoh yes, I had an email about your bag and it did not make it on the flight.‚Äô She assured me that a report had been filed for a missing bag already, and I filled out further information with her. So emirates at this point knew about my bag and that it was their responsibility. After letting me know that emirates would be in touch via email or phone and that my bag would most likely be on the next flight, I left the airport for my overnight layover in Seattle. I had nothing with me beyond a small back pack with my toothbrush. I had been travelling at this point for over 30 hours. 
By the next day, I had not received an email or call from emirates. I sent an email to them with no response (to this day). As I had no clothes or toiletries that day and would have another 24 hours before I made it home, I purchased some essential items. The emirates employee at Seattle airport the day prior had assured me that I would be eligible for compensation for the purchase of essential items. I was back at the airport the next day for the my next flight. I still had not heard anything from emirates so I went by their desk at the Seattle airport, yet it said it was closed and no one was around. I flew on my final flight, and once back in Canada that evening I tried to call emirates. I was on hold for 1 hour with no response. The next day I called emirates again (as I still had no contact from them) and was on hold for 1.5 hours before finally getting through to someone. However, I have never spoken to someone so rude on the phone. She blamed me for not having a bag tag number, saying I must have lost it and that she had no idea where my bag was. after explaining the situation multiple times and assuring her that emirates had known where my bag was two days prior she put me back on hold For another 20 minutes. Then she said she did know where my bag was and that emirates would contact me later. She said ‚Äúgo online for compensation‚Äù. The next day I still had heard nothing from emirates. I sent another email (no response yet to this day). I waited two more days with nothing. After 8 days of my bag missing, emirates had still not contacted me once. I called them again, spent three hours on hold and finally spoke to another representative who was again extremely rude. He told me that there was no missing bag file and that the case was closed. HOW COULD THIS BE WHEN I HADNT RECEIVED MY BAG YET??? He said call another airline this has nothing to do with emirates. 
I could not believe it. He hung up. 
I assumed at this point I would never get my bag back and emirates would never be helpful. 
However, three hours later I get a call from Alaska airlines (again no thanks to emirates) who say ‚Äúa representative from emirates just dropped a bag off here for you‚Äù. So apparently they did know where my bag was and that they were responsible for it. 
Alaska was wonderful to deal with and they had my bag delivered to me within 2 days, with excellent communication. I was emailed and called at every stage along the way. It was a vast difference from my experience with emirates.

By the way, he was sitting on the side & the lady at the boarding gate was happy to see my extra documentation and ask me direct questions.

I recently flew Emirates on a return journey ‚Äì London to Dubai in economy on the Airbus A380.  I first flew emirates in economy in early 2013 and was impressed that I flew with them again and shortly after trying their business class 3 or 4 times before flying their first class 3 3 or 4 times.   So I had fairly high expectations!  

Boarding wasn‚Äôt anything special.  As we walked to our seats I couldn‚Äôt help but notice that the plane had a terrible smell, perhaps BO, sweat, sewage or food smells ‚Äì whatever it was, it was not pleasant!  

Our group consists of 3 travellers, 2 of which require special assistance.  After booking my flight, I called Emirates Customer Service to request the assistance and they happily arranged this for us.  Whilst arranging this the representative also selected our seats ‚Äì 61ABC.  At the time I had no idea that these were over the middle of the wing which meant we had very limited views out ÔÅå Frustratingly, I was unable to view the seat map to check availability for an alternative seat once the special assistance was added which meant I would have to call Emirates again. 

Once I arrived in Dubai, I was to check our return flight and disappointingly we had been given the same seats.  However, this time I was able to change them if I wished but unfortunately the flight was full and had to keep these so that we could sit together.  

The London to Dubai flight was a night flight and was okay.  The 6 hours+ flight went by fairly quick with the entertainment available, friendly crew and food & drink.

The food was however, disappointing.  We ordered 3 vegan meals which were all the same as expected.  The main course was gnoochi which lacked texture and was boring.  It was accompanied with a salad which was fresh but basic ‚Äì not like what I had on a recent Finnair flight.  You can watch all my flight reviews on my YouTube channel ‚ÄòLuxury vegan Travel‚Äô.

The service however, was amazing!  A lady called Stephanie looked after our section and was so friendly and helpful.  She made this flight very enjoyable!  Thank you Stephanie.

Our return journey had a similar boarding ‚Äì not hugely impressive.  

I have watched many YouTubers talk about the Emirates staff being ‚Äòhit and miss‚Äô ‚Äì meaning, you could get a fantastic crew one flight and the complete opposite on the next.  Until now I have flown with Emirates on about 12-14 legs and have never experienced this until this flight.  The crew looking after the area where we were seated didn‚Äôt seem to be happy and unfortunately they were not so helpful.

For example, as described above, we have 2 out of 3 passengers requiring special assistance.  I had to press the call button (for the first time) as the child behind my seat would not stop kicking and pushing my seat (even though it was not reclined) and the mother didn‚Äôt do anything despite giving her several looks.  Anyway after waiting 47 minutes, the call button light just turned off and no one came.  I pressed it again and no one came and the light was turned off again after 25 minutes.  Given that the crew had no idea as to what I wanted to tell them and given that we are passengers requiring special assistance, this was unforgivable and very poor.  

Another example is, I saw the meal and opted not to eat it.  Instead I asked them if they had some light snacks.  Most airlines will carry something like crisps, nuts or biscuits.  I‚Äôve even had popcorn!  The crew gave us 2 packs of ginger biscuits between 3 of us and said that this is all they had across the entire economy section (over 300 seats).  

I also visited the toilet about 1 hour, or 1 hour and 15 minutes before landing, and there was almost no toilet roll left.  You could tell that the toilets were not being monitored or cleaned regularly.  

I have been on hundreds of flights across many airlines in all 4 cabin types.
  This was the worst flight I have ever experienced and I do not recommend flying Emirates economy.  Whilst their business and first class products are generally good, the economy was poor.  I will never fly on their economy product again. 

I will be flying their rival Qatar Airways in economy soon and cannot wait to make a comparison!  You‚Äôll be able to see this on my channel.

I requested a wheel  chair while going back to gate but no one care. All I got in this trip was lot of leg pain and lot of stress for believing emirates.

Mentioning some here. I was a wheelchair passenger. No help was given by the cabin crew to take my belongings to the seat or back outside the plane from the seat. The cabin crew was rude and argumentative. Nobody ever responded to the flight attendant button. When the flight landed, the wheelchair was not ready outside the plane, and I was expected to walk till the airport for the wheelchair. This happened at both Dubai and Mumbai airports. At the Dubai airport, the wheelchair staff was extremely rude. The staff refused to take the wheelchair till the gate of the flight going to Mumbai. I was told to sit in the electric golf car and go to the gate, and then further walk it down to the plane. My family was refused the electric golf car service to the gate and had to walk to the gate (the same distance that the wheelchair staff refused to walk). The same experience happened both while going and coming at the Dubai Emirates airport. No golf car agreed to leave my family till the gate. I finally had to walk from the gate to the plane. The same was the story with the other wheelchair passengers. Flew by Emirates many times before also. But this time was a big suffering. Especially at the Dubai Airport. Emirates services have not only deteriorated, they have collapsed. JUST HYPED UP AND EXAGGERATED. THEY BADLY NEED TO REASSESS THEIR SERVICES. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT."

Its partnership with FlyDubai in my opinion is a total disaster.  The terminal is located in another building and they won't allow you to use Emirates lounge and force you to use the FlyDubai one in the other terminal, which is quite bizarre as they allow you to use the Emirates lounge if your onward FlyDubai flight is in the same terminal.   On the return flight they allowed use of the first class lounge, but surprise, the onboard meal is downgraded as a result, apparently they think you'll have a meal in the lounge anyway so you won't demand a good meal in-flight.  Wrong.  You don't do this with your European routes, why do you do this on your Asian ones.  Granted, this airline is cheaper than most Asian airlines but it is about the same price as Qatar and with Qatar you will get the same airline throughout the route.  Again, flydubai is a disaster, their lounge sucks and the meal service even on Emirates route has really gone down the tubes.  The service isn't that amazing either.

My flight started with an early morning transit visit to the First Class Lounge in Terminal A - always good because you can board directly from the lounge. As I was really tired after the African part of my journey I was happy to enjoy the peace and quiet of the lounge, sup fresh, chilled orange juice and chill out.

Eventually the flight was ready for boarding. The call to board was rather late and we were delayed in pushing off from the stand owing to missing passengers whose luggage had to be found and removed from the aircraft. We eventually took off just over 30 minutes behind schedule.

I was escorted to my seat/suite and I settled down to get some sleep just as soon as we had reached cruising altitude. The very friendly Thai crew member assigned to me ensured that I was comfortable but, after a pot of breakfast tea, she left me alone to sleep in the bed she made up for me which I very much appreciated. A few hours into the flight, I woke, noticed that we still over Iraqi air space and felt both thirsty and hungry. The good thing about travelling First class with Emirates is that you can eat whenever you want during the flight within reason.

I had missed the breakfast but started on the main meal being offered. This time I went for the foie gras which was the first time I had seen on an Emirates flight and followed that with six large prawns on an ample bed of rice. To conclude my meal I went for both the excellent cheese board AND the fresh fruit.

As for the excellent wines, I started with the sweet dessert wine Muffato della Sala Antinori 2015 which went perfectly with the foie gras. I followed up on this with the white Corton Charlemagne Grand Crus Louis Latour Burgundy. And I couldn't resist a glass of the Emirates Vintage, Chateau La Mission Haut-Brion 2007 from Bordeaux, France. For the cheese I my Emirates cabin crew support suggested that I also try a generously sized glass of the 40 year old Sandeman Tawny port. All fantastic!!!

After all this fine dining there was little else to do but enjoy the ride by continuing to follow a BBC Drama series on the excellent ICE entertainment system.

About 90 minutes before landing in D√ºsseldorf I was reminded about the shower that I had booked when boarding the aircraft. I love this. The chance to take a 5 minute shower, a shave and change of clothes made me feel so much better. And in the spa/shower area you have ample room to move about. Superb.

We eventually arrived just 11 minutes behind schedule which was a relief as I was due to rush on to attend a Bundesliga soccer game less that 2 hours later.

When she was serving dinner, I asked her if she had anything vegetarian as I have forgotten to make the request, she immediately retorted saying that it was either meat or chicken take it or leave it!

And the final insult was when she brought the Sandwiches over and asked her politely what was inside in order to safeguard against any allergic reactions, she told me to shoosh. That's when I contacted Purser Chitra Mooloo and CSV Jung Eun Noh (very professional members of the cabin crew) to complain and explained what has happened so far.

I intend to report this to CAA and other media organisations to prevent discrimination from happening to passengers on Emirate‚Äôs flight towards other ethnic and Jewish minorities and make Emirates take responsibility for their cabin crews‚Äô abusive behaviour.

It seems some eastern European cabin crews do not like non white travellers and treat them as second-class citizens. This is based on my own experience with other airlines as well as Emirates."

Then two suitcases damaged on arrival in BKK. Not amused by any of this. Now despite raising these complaints almost two months ago, I received their standard reply and have since written to them, which they replied stating they were still investigating, and another month has passed with three reminders to them, and total silence from them.

This isn't as plush as a dedicated Emirates lounge, but it's nonetheless quiet, peaceful and you can get a beer or other drink. 

I was one of two lucky passengers travelling in First Class on this B-777-300 series. Fortunately the seat/suite configuration is identical to the one in the much better A-380 aircraft, minus of course the spacious restrooms with shower facilities. Here you have mini bathrooms which I find so claustrophobic. On the short one hour hop over to Accra I was looked after by a very attentive Purser from Australia who gave me a number of tips on how to get the best out of the longer stretch over to Dubai. Oh, take off and landing were exactly on time. 

After the hours stopover in Accra where the crew were replaced we continued on our long journey. To make this as pleasurable as possible the odd glass of Dom Perignon 2012 champagne is always going to be helpful. Once we made cruising altitude it was time for some serious 5 Star in flight dining. To get me going I had a couple of glasses of spicey Bloody Marys. From the extensive menu I chose the caviar (served with proper mother of pearl spoons!), the beef tenderloin with a green peppery sauce and broccoli and concluding with the enormous and varied cheese board.

To wash this all down, from the excellent wine list I started with the Australian white Mount Mary Chardonnay from the Yarra valley followed by a South African red from Stellenbosch - the Mvemve Raats de Compostella. For the cheese I couldn't resist what turned out to a generously sized glass of the 40 year old Sandeman Tawny port. All fantastic!!!

After all this fine dining there was little else to do but enjoy the ride by starting to follow a BBC Drama series as recommended by the aforementioned Purser on the excellent ICE entertainment system. And then get a bit of sleep. 

Oh, I should mention that there is still an obligation to wear face masks during the flight. Except when eating and drinking which, as you can see, I tried to do for much of the flight! 

We eventually arrived at dawn, some 7 minutes ahead of schedule. Deplaning was a bit if a scramble and the long bus ride to the terminal was cramped. But on arrival in the terminal a polite Emirates representative guided me all the way through to the Terminal A and the entrance to the First class lounge where I waited for my connecting flight."

Me, my wife and daughter was flying back from Cochin. We had 3 pieces of checked in baggage with excess weight and we paid $300.00 (Normal charges for excess baggage) Our carry on was 10 kilo each and the guy insisted on no more than 7 kilos. We were made to transfer stuff to another suitcase and he charged another $100.00. All as per strict rules....fine. But once you enter the gate and the plane, almost everyone except me, were carrying suitcase that they could not even lift up. So why are they not applying the same rules to everyone. This happened to me in the past as well. Also, when you sit in Seattle ready to board the flight, they come after Brown skin, looking for bags that look slightly bigger. If you have White skin, you can carry on anything you want. And the ground staff, always treats people like real herd of cattle. Yesterday I saw in Seattle that they were making even wheelchair required passengers walk for at least 300ft before they were given wheel chairs. Never again on Emirates flights."

After a while, on both ends of the trip, I grew uncomfortable being on the plane. But, I'm not used to sitting for 9.5 hours, either, and not having much flexibility to move. All I know is that I was provided with 2 meals, both relatively tasty, extra masks and hand sanitizer, drinks when needed, and had a blanket and a pillow. It was quite cozy. I did rate them 4 stars only because we had to pay for the most basic seats if we wanted to sit together, which added another $108 to our trip. I'm not used to paying for where I want to sit unless I'm requesting an upgrade of some sort.

I DO wish they would enforce the mask mandate more strongly. It's repeated over and over, but there were young girls who never actually wore the mask, and nothing was said to them."

The flight was due to take off at 07:30 but there was a 48 minute delay. The welcome was of the usual high, polite Emirates standard and I was one of the first to find my seat 7A. This being a typical older B-777- 300 plane the seat configuration was 2-3-2 which is a bit cramped. I wonder why they don't also adopt the same, excellent configuration as in the A-380s. 

Anyway, once finally air borne they served a simple continental breakfast with fruit, yoghourt, cold meats, bread and a rather sad looking croissant. I was grateful for the orange juice and coffee.

I then settled down to continue to follow a BBC Drama series on the excellent ICE system that I had started on my earlier flight from Germany. 

Lunch was quite nice. I started with the roasted tomato soup and followed that with the nice and quite spicy prawn biryani. I finished this all off with a seasonal fruit plate. To wash this all down I had a dirty martini to get me in the spirit of things, then tried a couple of glasses of Chateau La Louviere Blanc 2016 followed by the Gevrey-Chambertin Vieilles Vignes 2012. Both were excellent. 

We eventually arrived at our first stop, Accra. We were late by 45 minutes. Here there was a change of crew. Those of us staying on for the final hop over to Abidjan were asked to stay in our seats. We left 5 minutes ahead of schedule and arrived at our final destination 59 minutes later. 

Service was impeccable once again. My only beef is the seat configuration which means if you have a window seat as I did, it meant clambering over the guy in the aisle seat who seemed to be irritated during the whole flight over to Accra where he got off.

(Emirates does not have a dedicated First Class lounge at LHR)

On our first flights in 2010 (four in total BHX > DBX, DBX > MLE, MLE > DBX, DBX > BHX) Emirates were in our opinion at the time the best we'd flown with. Oh how disappointing to find that for our 50th celebration (some two years late due to Covid) that Emirates have turned into what seems a poor budget style airline but with a premium price tag.
Check-in's at Birmingham and Dubai were all fine, at the Maldives it did seem to be reminiscent of the old EasyJet Scrum days with everybody scrambling to get on the plane all at once?  Most odd that they couldn't zone boarding as they did in other airports? 
Actually on board the aircraft is where the cost cutting can clearly be seen. You no longer get a welcome pack or bottle of water these are now replaced with a tube of hand gel and a facemask at least on 3 out of the 4 flights, on one of the flights not even that.
Gone are the days of having a menu with food choices in economy, instead this is replaced with the old """"chicken or beef"""" type of thing and I have to say the food is terrible.. and easily the worst food we've had on a long haul flight period. During our 7.5 hour flight to Dubai you get a pretty poor meal and quite literally a sandwich sized for the tiniest of hands with nothing to accompany it, which based on the quality of what was offered is actually a good thing.
The service on ALL four of the flights was pretty dire, the wife had her call bell on for half an hour with attendants wandering past up and down the isles taking no notice. Eventually when called as they were passing she was able to get a drink of water for pain killers. Other than with the meal service drinks were NEVER offered again I can only think this apparent """"call light"""" blindness is due to cost cutting in either cutting back on actual product, cutting back on competent attendants or both!
On all but one of the flights the seat back screen didn't actually work properly (the touch screen element), instead we ended up wrestling with the little controller to browse the entertainment which was fine but it wouldn't actually retract back into the hole once removed.
Timing wise all but one of the flights were on time, but for some odd reason the flight out of Dubai was delayed an hour (20 minutes in pilot time apparently) due to Dubai airport only having a single runway open???? Really??? An airport the size of Dubai, with planes queueing to take off and only 1 run way open at certain times of day???

Needless to say in every aspect on this occasion Emirates have let us down, not only have we had better,, but basically they have ALL been better including the charter airlines and we wont be choosing to use Emirates again.

Quality and Quantity was poor, we pre-ordered food selection but they served one of the meals to another passenger. Wine was poured in plastic glass and only once when meal was served. For next 6 hrs, there was no snack / drink or water. Normally majority of airlines would keep some sort of snacks / drinks in the airline galley so people can help themself.

But guy at the ticketing counter insisted that only 1 bag with max of 7kg will be allowed. So many people who had flown Emirates before were furious and complaining about this. I ended up paying extra fee to transfer stuff from my carry on into checked in bag. My carry on won't fit in the middle overhead bin which was ok when we came to Delhi. We were stuck in middle row with both aisle seats occupied. There was aisle seat available on the emergency seat, so I asked my fellow passenger to shift if nobody is using it.

However my attempts to get Emirates to know this through their direct channels has failed so I now find it necessary to use this last resort. 4 weeks or so ago, I boarded Emirates from Accra to Beirut, everything seemed well as always (I am a big fan of Emirates), after takeoff dinner was to be served, so once my turn reached I opened the ray only to find dark liquid stains all over the tray even spilled to the sides of the tray and food crumbs. I was actually really surprised to see this on my favourite airline, so I showed it to the host and he apologised and tried to clean it but the stains were so bad he couldn't. He went to the business class cabin and got some other materials that eventually did the job. I did a complaint inflight on the feedback form on ICE expecting to get some kind of answer but nothing came. So I waited a few weeks and tried to do the same through their website but it was refusing my ticket number. I got in contact with the local office in Accra but they could not say much. For someone who flies everywhere with Emirates, even using routes that are 3 times longer rather than take other airlines, this level of lack of responses to feedbacks is not assuring at all!"

The seating of 2-3-2 in business class is cramped and very different from the 2-2-2 seating on the Paris-Dubai leg on the A380, or even the 777. The seats did not recline fully, and no mattresses were provided (as they were on the outbound journey on 18 April). The toilets are old and dirty, and not cleaned regularly. 
The food choices were inadequate, and the quality below par. The wines were good even though the air hostess kept referring to the red wine as """"French Chateau""""! The absence of training was much in evidence - we have not experienced this on Qatar or Singapore Airlines. 
Boarding in Dubai was chaotic. The Economy class line moved much quicker than First and Business Class. There was no sequenced, or staged, boarding.

They are a pale shadow of what they once were and seem to have no vetting process to onboard vendors. I traveled with family ( wife , toddler and infant) from India to JFK on 7th May and was eligible for chauffeur service. From India onwards they've been dropping the ball . The driver in India came without child seats despite telling emirates before hand I was traveling with 2 children. He claimed he did not receive communication from emirates. We stayed for a night in Dubai and the car was supposed to pick us up at 6 a.m on 7th May. The chauffeur never showed up and I got a call at 6.30 a.m after I reached the airport saying chauffeur is at the hotel. We landed in JFK on 7th May and after a 1.5 hour wait for baggage we finally managed to walk out of the airport.( absolutely indifferent ground services team who couldn't care less about customers. There was a lady and a man working the counter . The lady was running around addressing irate customers while the man just sat there and was arrogant with every single person who walked up to him).

The chauffeur was assigned to us when we exited the gate and he started giving excuses the moment he saw we had a lot of luggage. He started saying we would need a 2nd car and I should talk to the supervisor. I told him let's first start loading the car and I can then call the supervisor if needed. Again Emirates had made no provision for child seats which frankly did not surprise me anymore.  I had infact also called emirates the previous day ( my 4th call in 2 days) and told them about the slip ups in India and to ensure there were child seats available in the US besides making sure they give us a van which could accommodate all of us plus the luggage.

The chauffeur asked us to come to the curb while he got the car to the curbside. Thankfully we had engaged a porter who was extremely kind and helpful throughout. My family and I along with the porter were waiting at the curbside waiting for the car and the chauffeur just disappeared. It was raining and windy and my kids started crying and shivering in the cold. We have a 9 month old who started shivering and his body started getting really cold. I sent them back in to the airport and called emirates to figure out wtf was going on with their driver. Despite telling them of our situation and the fact we were traveling with 2 kids there was zero empathy . I was on hold for 20 plus minutes and the call eventually got disconnected.  There was no call back to figure out if we managed to find the driver. They just don't care I guess. 

We finally managed to track down the supervisor of the ground services company after a good 1hour ( the team had shut shop and left) . We waited a further 1 hour before he could eventually get us 2 cars and we were in the cars by 6.30 p.m and finally reached home at 8.30 p.m . The kids were cranky, hungry and jetlagged and it was a relief to finally get home.

The thing about this whole experience was that there was not a hint if empathy from emirates. They seem to have basically just washed their hands off the whole experience and rely solely on third party services. There doesn't seem to be any quality audits or controls/redress systems in place to check if things are working as they are supposed to.

I normally wouldn't have waited for them to figure out chauffeur service ( made my own arrangements in Dubai) but was handicapped by the fact that I couldn't get an uber which was big enough to accommodate our family, luggage and also had child seats.

Overall I found their employees (except cabin crew who were exceptional) to be rude ,arrogant and inconsistent with regards to information. I was also given wrong information about the  cocid test ( had a stopover in Dubai and hence not straightforward) . I had to scramble on the day of the journey to make sure we satisfied the requirements. Again no hint of apology or regret that they had given completely wrong info which could have jeopardized our trip. 

Suffice to say that I'll never again fly Emirates after the ordeal they put my family through during this journey.  I've seen large organizations fail too often because they took customers for granted and thought they were too big to listed to the voices of their customers. Emirates is headed that way and I don't think they are interested in course correction.

I flew Lufthansa on my onward leg and it was positively wonderful contrary to what I've heard. I guess that's the go to option for me in the future."

I finally made it to the peace and tranquility of the excellent Emirates lounge in Terminal C. A few drinks later and with the odd snack inside me I had calmed down. 

Boarding was trouble free. I was really surprised by the warm and friendly welcome of the crew, particularly when they confided in me that I was the only passenger in First Class - Suite 1A. Wow! As you can imagine the next 6 hours or so were heavenly. 

As I supped a glass of Moet et Chandon champagne we got ready for take off which eventually occurred just 5 minutes behind schedule. Not long after gaining cruising altitude I switched to a couple of glasses of Dom Perignon 2012 champagne. Even before I could decide on my evening meal, the purser came and checked that I would want to start with the caviar. I was impressed that they had stored my preferences in their customer data base. And when it was served it came with a mother of pearl spoon - something that didn't happen in the past and which I had politely pointed out. Never serve caviar with normal silverware... 

I followed this with the grilled beef tenderloin that came with a delicious creamy peppercorn sauce. 

For wines, I wanted to try the white Chateau Lafaurie-Peyraguey 2016 from Bordeaux with the caviar and then the unbelievable Chateau La Mission Haut-Brion 2007 from the Emirates Vintage Collection with the main course. Fantastic. I concluded this extravaganza meal with some fresh fruit and a beaker of hot chocolate.

There are many ways to get there, so the questions are: why should you use EMIRATES  and why should you spend the extra money for Business Class?

I've been to Dubai thrice.  Each time, I flew from my home airport JFK which means a 12 and a half hour ride (minimum).   The first time I flew to Dubai, I used Emirates airline, and was surprised by the extra-large airplane we were using, the A380-800. 

The A380-800, whether you're in business class or Economy is the largest, most comfortable, quietest aircraft you can currently fly in.  The rows in economy are 3 by 5 by 3 while those in business are 1 by 2 by 4 with staggered mini bars at each seat and space for lay-flat sleeping in the chairs.   No other plane offers this. The A380 is the backbone of Emirate's fleet.   

The plane also boasts dual walk-in shower rooms, dual bartender areas and a double-decker experience the 747 can only dream of.

The entire plane's interior is beautifully crafted and well appointed with decorative colors, fiber-optic starry ceiling panels, mood lighting and a welcoming, airy feel. 

On my trip for Spring Break 2022, after 2 years of the COVID disaster, I decided to visit Maldives using Emirate's business class round-trip.  The flight consisted of 2 flights on the A380, one flight on a 777 (to Maldives) and one flight on a 737 returning from Maldives. 

The 777's business class product is definitely not as nice or as luxurious as the A380's because the seats and equipment are older with an older look and older feel.  Economy  class in a 777 isn't very spacious or comfortable either. Airbus just happens to make better seating.   

While I was disappointed in the 777, I was even more disappointed by the 737.  Though I rode the FlyDubai's 737 Business Class, it was so much smaller than the 777 that just using the bathroom was a cramped experience I don't wish to experience again.  I couldn't even stand up in the 737's bathroom. As the Fly Dubai flight wasn't an Emirates product directly, I won't use that to downgrade EMirate's itself.  But I must ask:  why is it that a 777 wasn't used to return from Maldives when it was used to bring us in the first place?

Emirates, I've noticed doesn't load flights to smaller island destinations like Seychelles and Maldives, but the return flights to Dubai tend to be loaded to the hilt. That means there's virtually no margin for seat changes or special accommodations. 

Then there's the BUSINESS CLASS LOUNGES.  On this trip, I used both the JFK lounge and the Dubai lounge.  Emirates Dubai lounge offers  private shower rooms, an expansive lounge area with sofa chairs, loveseats, ottomans and cots to rest on. There's a children's play space, plenty of food and drink with open self-serve bars, breakfast buffet foods and lunch/dinner buffet foods.  There's also plenty space to charge electronic devices and to simply sit down to meet or conversate. 

The JFK lounge was included with my ticket ($100 value), but the Dubai lounge required a $130 fee.  Because I had a 5 hour layover, I simply paid the fee and enjoyed a nice warm shower, a huge breakfast and plenty of refreshing drinks until my flight. It was well worth the cost.

My checked baggage held my toiletries, but the shower area gave me a pre-packaged towel, bathmat  and a wash cloth to use.  There was liquid soap, shampoo with conditioner and a other toiletries available thanks to the fact Emirates gives each patron a toiletry kit (Bvlgari).  I had a razor, shaving cream, deodorant, lotion, cologne, perfume and tissues along with a dental kit to use.

Emirates treats both its facilities and its aircraft with the attention to detail you'd expect from a luxurious hotel product. 

The flight alone was the highlight of my trip.  I'm 6'6"""" and have the body of an offensive lineman.  I need the extra space. I can't sit in their economy seats for 13 hours.  The space to flatten your seat and lay out truly helps you appreciate air travel, while the cramped economy class would have you dread air travel.   I can't go backwards. I can't fly economy anymore after being pampered by Emirates and I no longer look at airplanes the same way anymore. I must be on the A380.

I watched several movies including the original Star Wars trilogy, the  Back to the Future trilogy, House of Gucci, Fast and Furious 9, The Avenger's Endgame films, Spider Man: No Way Home, and a few others during my flights. I probably watched 15 movies in total. 

The A350 is also nice  when you're in business class, but it's not as quiet or as spacious.  It completely lacks the bar experience, the shower experience for First class and the spaciousness for economy class. 

Unfortunately, the A380 could one day go extinct. This quad engine jet burns fuel at a high rate and costs upwards of $30,000 an hour to operate. Its size makes it unusable on smaller runways and unserviceable in smaller airports.  For now, Emirates, Etihad, Asiana and most Asian airlines use this plane, but the North American, South American and Europeans mostly opt for smaller, twin-engine jets to reduce their operational costs. 

Let us pray that airlines continue to use the A380 for international flights until a reasonably efficient solution can be reached that offers the A380's amenities. 

Was everything perfect?  Of course not.  There are some issues.

#1 The check-in process on the app requires you select your seats as soon as possible.  I got lucky going:  I got the window seat I wanted on the A380.  On my return, however, I ended up with an aisle seat that wasn't as isolated. The window seat with the minibar on the aisle is the best, most isolated seat. 

#2 The last row of seats before the bar is the WORST POSSIBLE SEATING YOU CAN GET in business class.  Firstly, because the area directly behind the curtain is heavily trafficked to the bathroom and bar area, but because the stewardesses are constantly moving back and forth.   Worst:  the window seats AND the aisle seats are directly exposed to the aisles while the minibars occupy the better space you'd actually want to be sitting in."

It was toss up between Emirates and Qatar, but as they had better timings than Qatar and the fact that they use Airbus A380's, I chose Emirates. 

Boarding the plane in Perth was easy and quick.  Kudo's to the land side crew. 
I had booked an aisle seat on the first flight, and then a premium economy on the Dubai - Lon leg. 
When the doors were closed, there were two empty seats between me and another passenger (we were in the middle row 3-4-3 configuration).   I had been keeping an eye out on the seating arrangements leading up to the flight, as I knew that I was travelling to see my elderly parents and hoped that I wouldn't be seated on top of someone - to try and stay Covid free!  (Now, I admit, I can't say this is how I got it - but I wanted to share my reasoning!)
Unfortunately, a couple had been seated separately, and they were moved to the seats that were empty.   The lady that was sat next to me, coughed throughout the flight and her husband kept taking his mask off and leaving it off for long period of time. 
(I tested positive for COVID 2 days later!)

I had booked a Non-Lactose meal and when it came, I was so disappointed.  The food was incredibly bland and it was accompanied by a roll (and lactose free butter) and fruit (mostly melon).    As it was nearly midnight, I didn't really worry to much, took a sleeping tablet and slept. 
When the second meal came, I had no margarine or butter with my very bland meal - and when I asked if I could have some margarine, I got a 'sorry - you have ordered a special meal - we don't have anything spare'!   Margarine!  That is all I asked for.  
Oh and the fruit that came - ONLY melon. 
No lactose free milk for tea or coffee - so it had to be black or nothing!  I chose nothing! 

Second flight - Dubai to London.  What a difference premium economy was!   Food was good (not so bland) but presented a bit nicer. 
Seating is amazing and for what I paid for an upgrade, I was super pleased with what I got.   The second flight was only 7 hours, but I managed to catch up on sleep, with the leg rests up.  I will say though, that if you are in a window seat, and you need to get out and the person in front has their seat reclined, it is extremely difficult. 

For my return flights to Perth, I thought I would try a Vegan option - and my first flight (London to Dubai) the food was amazing.  Very tasty and I felt some care had gone into the menu choice for this. 

Unfortunately, the Dubai - Perth leg, reverted back to the Lactose Free option which I ate NOTHING off - except for the bread roll! 
Advertising that the 'Easter bunny' had been and everyone was getting something special - I got nothing! zero!  So for 11 hours, I had two bread rolls. 

The airbus A380 is a lovely plane.  Seating is really comfy and the atmosphere in the plane is a lot more relaxing.  
Toilets are clean and spacious. 
Staff were excellent (mostly).

Dubai airport staff need a little bit of training in customer service!  As you get your bags checked as you board, they take your water off you, even though you have purchased it airside.  They don't care.   It is a small space for a large amount of people that you get penned into and so people are pushing and trying to get in the front of the queue, even though the airline loads by zones.    

Customer service was great.  I called twice to enquire about PCR test changes and date changes - and both times I got off the phone with consistent and accurate information. 
I did change my flight - pushing back by 3 days, and paid an additional AU$700 - but that was on me, and not the fault of the airline. 

Would I fly with them again?  YES - but I would make sure that I chose the VEGAN option for food, and if the premium economy was priced well, I would chose that again."

- Older American Tourister model 3 years old 

I was lucky to report all three damages at the baggage terminal it has been an ongoing process for three weeks and it's still not resolved. They keep insisting that the baggage can be repaired. To be more clear every suitcase has been destroyed around the structure of the wheel, one has the handle missing and the brand new one is cracked around the frame of the body. Any temporary fix would not ensure the integrity of the luggage and the material cant be super-glued together or welded together. 

They have been trying to cut corners by claiming it can be repaired, Now they have offered me US300 dollars for all three bags. This pathetic offer is only enough for one bag with Samsonite and some pocket change. 

They even deducted 10% of the value of the brand new Samsonite bag (as I said it was purchased brand new one month before my flight). Pretty much offering me US$20 for the other two bags. 

Emirates Airlines cut a corner and their reputation is solely based on their in-flight experience. They pay their flight attendants terribly and expect them to give 110% customer service from them. However, their ground staff, online customer services, telephone customer services, and especially their baggage claims services completely suck.

Especially when the seat in front reclines which was most of flight and during meals . Could hardly move to get anything out of my bag under seat. Getting out from aisle seat extremely difficult. 
We had no food or drinks - for two hours. Had our own water in hand luggage but not the point. Getting the attention of cabin crew from a window seat was difficult as they rushed past . On return flight from Dubai I did resort to pressing the call bell but thought that should be as a last resort. 
Food on return flight was boring and tasteless. A dry pastry was all we received on first meal service after takeoff from Dubai. Thankfully we had time to buy snacks at the airport to keep us going. The lactose free meal my husband ordered came at least 45 minutes before my normal meal but he was not offered a drink until the usual meals were served so after he‚Äôd finished eating! 
Shockingly bad service. 
The entertainment screens were difficult to use as had to push it very hard before anything happened. Every announcement froze the screen in middle of films etc several times disturbing the so called entertainment. Then it stopped working completely until someone eventually reset it. 
We last used Emirates in 2007 when it was much better with helpful crew and better seats. 
I cannot see why it still has such a good reputation. Also the toilet ran out of soap and the crew couldn‚Äôt find any more so I had to queue to use the other toilet just to wash my hands. There was also what looked like blood stains on the toilet wall  which was never cleaned all flight. 
The A380 on the flights to Mauritius from Dubai were better seats as newer . I had paid for slightly bigger seats which were more comfortable. Screen was much better. But service was still slow and poor. The 777-300 should be permanently replaced.

Before I begin, I think it should be know that I am not normally the kind of person who writes reviews regardless of how amazing or disappointing I may find a service, but after speaking to my Emirati friends about how shockingly poor my experience was and seeing how embarrassed they, as UAE residents, were just to be associated with a such a lack of professionalism, customer care and happiness. It is on their advice that I wrote this record of my experience. 

I am a loyal Emirates customer, to the point that when I book a flight I don‚Äôt even consider other airlines in my search but instead go directly through Emirates because I know what the brand stands for in terms of quality of service and customer satisfaction. I even go as far to recommend the airline to anyone I speak to about traveling because I have never had a sub-par experience on the airline in all my years of flying. When the opportunity reopened to travel again, I couldn‚Äôt wait to showcase Emirates and Dubai to my partner, as it is somewhere I had imagined we will one day live. All of the above is but a distant emotion now, I will ABSOLUTELY NOT be choosing to fly Emirates again and am still debating whether I cancel my return flight with Emirates and book instead with another airline. 

Here‚Äôs why: 

My partner and I arrived at the airport full of excitement to be traveling overseas for the first time in over 2 years. The only thing that disappeared faster than that bubbling sense of anticipation was the Emirates cabin crew whenever we pressed the ‚Äúcall‚Äù button. In fact, at one point a full glass of red wine was spilled on my girlfriend‚Äôs feet and after waiting 15 minutes and calling multiple times for cabin crew assistance to clean it up we eventually had to clean it up ourselves with toilet paper. At NO point did the cabin crew make us feel even remotely welcome, I completely understand that long shifts can be gruelling but when you pay good money for a ticket the very least you expect is a smile and not to be made to feel like your very existence is an inconvenience to the cabin crew. 

When we stopped over in Kula Lumpur, besides being rudely jostled and pushed around by the leaning staff at 3am, the new cabin crew were so aggressive that it made us feel like we were criminals with the way they spoke to us during the pre-flight checks. Its 3am and I‚Äôve been flying for 10 hours already, I do not deserve to be scolded, shouted at and ordered around so aggressively by a flight attendant to the point that we were INTIMIDATED and paranoid that if we weren‚Äôt careful that both us and our luggage would be thrown off of the aircraft. International travel is stressful enough at the best of times, there is no need for airline staff to make it more stressful than it already is.

On our flight there were 2 children who scream-cried for the entire 19 hour flight, now I understand that flying is intimidating for children and that there is not much parents can do to stop their kids from crying but what disappointed me was that not ONCE did any member of the cabin crew go over to the parents to offer any form of assistance, instead they seemed to blatantly ignore them. There are over 100 passengers in that section of the aircraft who would‚Äôve had their sleep interrupted by a screaming toddler, I expect much better management from the cabin crew!

When we got to Dubai, I had hoped that the nightmare was over, we had registered to stay in a hotel through Dubai Connect ahead of our connecting flight to Cape Town the next day and all we wanted to do was shower and catch up on the sleep we had missed from the hellish first leg of the journey. I had been liaising with Dubai Connect for 6 weeks prior to departure to ensure that everything (hotel booking and 96 hr visas) were organised well ahead of departure. Because I am traveling on a South African passport, I needed to submit a colour copy of my passport and a colour photograph in order to be granted a 96-hour visa to enter Dubai. This was done 6 weeks ahead of departure (Early February) and I was ENSURED that I would receive a visa between 14 days and 48 hours before my flight from Auckland departed. The day before departure, I had still not received any confirmation of my visa and I spent 3 HOURS on the Emirates New Zealand customer care phone line waiting for an answer which, after nobody answered I gave up and decided to ask the staff in Auckland Airport about my visa.  The staff at Auckland airport told me that ‚ÄúStaff in Dubai were notified and would resolve it‚Äù so you can imagine how impressed I was when I landed in Dubai after 19 hours of the worst imaginable flight only to be told that my visa hadn‚Äôt even been processed yet and that I would need to resubmit all the information I had provided 6 WEEKS BEFORE and then still wait 2-3 MORE HOURS for it to be processed. This, on its own was the single most disappointing bit of service as I had done everything exactly as instructed and was still made to wait due to the blind incompetence of Emirates administration. If this was the kind of service a small business gave each of its clients, I wouldn‚Äôt expect it to last a quarter. Dismal. 

You‚Äôd think it couldn‚Äôt get worse. 

Well it can. 

When we eventually received our hotel vouchers and my visa we were on our way to check into the Copthorne Hotel as part of Dubai Connect, when we got to the hotel lobby I was surprised to see that the check-in line was surprisingly long. The reason soon became apparent; there was ONE staff member processing check-ins while the other 4 stood around doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING while the line grew steadily longer and longer with each bus that arrived. We stood in line for nearly 2 HOURS and it was only when people started to complain that more hotel staff actually started to do some work. 

It took us nearly 5 hours to get from the plane to our hotel room. Purely because of the incompetence of Emirates administration.

Then 10 seconds later at the check-in counter the desk clerk said that we were too late. For the flight leaving in little over an hour. Perplexed we stod there wondering what was happening. The guy supervising the que had called different destinations serveral times making sure these could jump the line, but only called ours once and that while us being first in line. We tried to explain but it was clearly our fault not understanding and besides we should be at the airport 3 to 4 hours before the flight?!

I think I should share my experience with Emirates as well.
I bought a ticket from Australia to Brazil through Dubai and within 24 hours that I bought my ticket (8hs to be more precise), I requested a cancellation. I was told by Emirates I had to pay $200 per person ($600 for us 3) as a cancellation fee. Australian flight companies offer a 24-hour full refund so as does America. They refused to refund me in full even after I have called them 3 times and they all were very rude and no negotiation nor compassion was shown. I believe if a company has been trading inside a country, they should follow policies for that country. They also told me if was American they would refund in full, but as I am from Australia they refused...

I have also gone through their website for a complaint, and the page does not work. They don't have a page on their website dedicated to the cancellation policy, and neither does their fares when emailed has clear information regarding their cancellation policy. 

I have also travelled with them before and a few points so people can be aware. Food are limited...you don't have an option to buy and they offer food every 8hs (my flight was 14hs flight), snacks are awful (also limited).

I am a permanent resident of the United States and have purchased two tickets for my wife and 15-year-old son, who were fully vaccinated with Pfizer against Covid-19 and also had valid travel documents and advanced parole. They boarded a flight from Iran to IKA Airport and, on a transit flight from Dubai to Orlando, FL, an UAE flight attendant confiscated their passports and detained them for two days in an office without access to telephone, food or water. And fired again at Tehran airport.
An Emirates employee explained to them that they could not board a flight to Florida because of the travel ban, but the airline did not respond to them if they followed the instructions. Why did they board them on the first flight from Tehran airport to Dubai and why did not prevent them of flying from Tehran?
They were restricted from returning to the United States for two days, due to the illegal action of the UAE airline employee, their visa expired, and I had to hire a lawyer to get them permission to re-enter. My son suffered from mental and social problems because he was absent from high school for three months. And with a lot of trouble and payments, they finally returned to Florida.
Emirates not only did not respond to my complaint about this incident, but also did not reimburse the cost of the tickets purchased, which were $ 2864.90.

It was only an eight hour and ten minute flight and being in the daytime I could achieve a great deal of work during the flight.
The majority of all Airlines which depart to Manila from Dubai are at an ungodly hour in the very, very early morning. Emirates seems to be bucking the trend by having a mid-morning departure which departs Dubai Terminal Three at 9:25 am. Our scheduled arrival time was to be 21:35, but unfortunately we left the gate exactly a full hour late so we arrived in Manila just over an hour behind schedule.
The service was simply fantastic and extremely professional. The full crew really went out of their way to deliver some of the best service I have ever experienced on any airline. . 
The food was very delicious and flavorsome. We started with a light breakfast and then three hours later enjoyed a full four course lunch. They started with a nice selection of three appetizers. I had the fantastic Roasted tomato soup and then I enjoyed a great Chili garlic prawn‚Äôs main course and for desert I relished an incredible Cheese board that included: a pleasant Caledonian cheddar; a fine Gillot Camembert and finally a very, very wonderful Cropwell Bishop Stilton PDO.
Emirates offers a very nice Mo√´t & Chandon Imp√©rial Brut Champagne and has a nice, but very limited, wine list that included one enjoyable White Bordeaux, a fun Napa Valley Rose and finally a full bodied French Saint-Julien Red wine.
Unfortunately I feel I gained five kilograms during this flight, but I plan to work it off in Manila.
If you want a really enjoyable flight I suggest that you take Emirates Business Class to your next destination."

We have been travelling with Emirates for over 10 years and in the past this airline has been distinguished by the quality of its service: meals, cabin service, flight crew, flight comfort. This is now a thing of the past. First of all, Emirates in connecting flights often forces passengers to do part of the journey with FlyDubai ( low cost, low quality airlines). Secondly, excessive savings can be seen - no toiletries kit, no slippers, no toothbrush (we used to get a kit for longer flights). In addition, the choice of meal options is limited, wine is served from large bottles which often threatens to spill and get dirty. There is a very small selection of drinks. No snacks are served on long flights. Staff do not offer off-service drinks to passengers, which can lead to dehydration. There is too little service and a lack of proper passenger care. Emiretes used to be special, today it is common so it is not worth overpaying. I have travelled with Turkish Airline several times recently. The journey has been more punctual and comfortable and the price much lower. I am considering dropping the Emirates loyalty programme.

The day we land, the man who checked us in through customs. First took my picture, gave me my things back everyone else‚Äôs was getting done next, then he rudely asks me to take my contacts out. Now one thing I‚Äôm not, is dumb. We have been flying for over 10 hours, touching things, and are exhausted. I politely ask why, and he proceeds to say, because he can not tell that it is me. First of all, you‚Äôre lying the camera is called face recognition, whether I have my contacts or glasses on, it will TELL ANYONE it‚Äôs me or boo boo the fool. As I politely told him, my hands not only are dirty, but I have no way of taking them out while in a line with no contact solution. As he proceeds to try to degrade me, laughing with his workers and speaking in Arabic, he then tells me with a smirk, well then you can ‚Äúgo‚Äù as in get back on the plane and return to my country. NEVER have I ever. That‚Äôs not the best experience we had. It gets better. As it‚Äôs now time to leave Dubai, we were NOW told our Covid tests weren‚Äôt valid, and to return to the states it has to be within 24 hours, not 72 hours‚Ä¶.oh how lovely. Now we have to pay again for a Covid test, and when we all proceed to get our Covid tests, they called all of our names wrong, some by our last name. Some by their middle names, and or just whatever they wanted. The man who did my mothers tests, calls out our last name‚Ä¶.gives her, the paper and passport. We all proceed to walk off. However the mistake we made was not confirm what they handed us was correct. We get to the gate, and my mothers passport was wrong, it was another woman with the same ethnicity, and had a last name very similar to ours. Her last name was Just longer but contained our last name in hers. Now we are pressing for time. My mom gets back to the testing site and the man rudely tells my mother ‚Äú I told you to check‚Äù. Now correct me if I am wrong, but as a NURSE and or someone who works in the medical field, aren‚Äôt you also the one whom is to correct and or make sure information given is correct to avoid also HIPPA laws? Then the woman who‚Äôs passport was given incorrectly too my mother was about to put an alert out, stating my mom stole it. This potentially could mean jail, in a mother country, as they also do not take too crimes being committed. This just was a trip from hell. How can someone steal something that can‚Äôt just be picked up, by anyone. It has to manually be handed to you, by a WORKER of the airport assigned to the Covid testing areas. If anyone was to ask me my experience, and or would I be back. It would be a H*** ‚ÄòNO! Not for at least 10 years abs by then I would have been to better places with a better experience. The taxis are rude. They tell you once price, arrive then act like they have amnesia and don‚Äôt remember the quote they told you and Jack the piece up. It‚Äôs not until you get a better driver with better manners who wants to take you, then the original now wants to remember what was said. I would kindly tell others choose a different country for sure."

Chauffeur drive from my home to the airport turned out to be a Birmingham City Council taxi. 
I have never experienced this before. 

Despite Tristar being called three times prior to the the journey, to explain we had four adults and six large pieces of luggage in our party, the driver looked bemused, stating he could not fit six pieces of luggage in his vehicle. I had to organise it for him, which took a matter of minutes. 

The journey started and progressed with severe shaking to the vehicle which was raised with the driver. 

Ultimately, a tyre blew out on the taxi on the M42, ten miles from Birmingham airport. 

The taxi had no spare wheel. 

The driver clearly had no knowledge of motorway protocol, suggesting my family got back inside the taxi to stay warm, as opposed to stand behind the crash barrier. 

When I photographed the driver badge and a bald tyre on the taxi, I was challenged strongly by the driver, who told me I had no right to photograph his car. His aggression was robustly addressed. 

Myself and my wife spent almost thirty minutes on the phone advising Emirates we were at standing at the side of a motorway in 3C temperature. 

A few days after arriving in Dubai I raised my concerns, with photo evidence, to Richard Dewsbury and Sir Tim Clark, both senior executives of Emirates UK via email. 

An email reply received, was in my view dismissive, offering to close the matter with an offer of 25000 air miles per traveller. 

My reply indicated I was not prepared to be bought off for even 2,500,000 air miles per passenger, that I was not interested in compensation and that I was more concerned about my family being driven in what I considered an unroadworthy death trap!

The response to this email was that an investigation with Addison Lee confirmed the taxi was roadworthy. 

My response indicating this could simply could not been the case, resulted in my email and/or domain name being blocked !

On arrival back in the UK I instructed my IT Manager email Emirates to re air my concerns, as my emails were continually being returned. 

The reply received was that no further compensation could be offered. 

My reply to this stating I had never asked for compensation simply bounced, again. 

All I can say, having been a frequent user of Emirates business and first class travel over many years, is that I am appalled at the way customer concerns, particularly given the concern related to a severely unworthy road vehicle, are addressed, something, which unless I had experienced it, I would have struggled to believe.

But suddenly at airport I got to know that my flight got cancelled at 1:00AM on Jan 19. I reached out to the Help Desk team at airport, called Customer Support team to help me in rescheduling my flight as the cancellation is because of the Emirates and they let the customer know about the cancellation just 3 hours prior to the flight departure time from Delhi. 

Help Desk at airport: When I reached out to the Help Desk team, they replied stating, ‚ÄúThere is nothing in our hands, you need to reach out to the customer support team‚Äù. 

Customer Support team: When I called Customer support team, they replied, ‚ÄúAll the flights has been cancelled from today. Even we don‚Äôt know when there will be the next available flights. You need to wait until further notice‚Äù. This is the response what is received from the team. 

I just foolishly believed in them and was waiting for their further notice to reschedule my flight. I waited for 1 day long at the airport because Delhi is not my home town to go and I came all the way from Hyderabad to Delhi by paying extra luggage charges for domestic flight.  

As I didn‚Äôt get any response even after waiting for 1 day long at airport, I booked another flight in other airlines which is Qatar airlines. I got very good response from them and finally reached Dallas. So, after reaching Dallas, I raised REFUND REQUEST.  

After raising refund request, the most craziest thing happened to me again from Emirates was, 

My total fare was $940 to and fro and they refunded me with just $275.  

Emirates team cancelled the flight. 

Team informed about the cancellation just prior to 3 hours because of which even I cannot do anything.

When they finally reappeared at the captain announced that we would finally take off around 18:00 by then, the hostess in my area told me (when asked why they only offered one glass of water during this never ending wait aboard the flight stranded) that I could have gone to the serving stating and asked for drinks :-) When we finally took off for this 3.5 hours flight to reach destination they finally served what was supposed to be a warm meal it turned out to be a cold snack. Again when asked the Hostess told me that the food had been heated for the scheduled take off time and the food went bad and could not be reheated ... To top it all, though I admittedly received several emails and sms's while waiting on the plane for almost six hours before take off, from Emirates Airlines announcing new take off times each time. But we never received any email explaining what had happened or apologizing for the inconvenience caused to all of us. The latter for us was the culminating fact that an airline with such record of """"medals"""" and awards recognizing their impeccable service could not bother to try and absorb our anger and agony with a simple: sorry, it was beyond control email etc etc Being over sixty have traveled over four continents and have been to more than fifty countries there have had my fair share of airplane travel and thought I had seen it all, but i obviously had not and believe it was a shameful experience as it was handled very unprofessionally by the captain, the crew and the airline!

You are one of the best airlines out there but maybe you should check more your ground staff in some airports? Like the airport of Colombo in Sri Lanka. Only 2 employees behind the counters to serve more than 200 passengers  who were waiting with us from twelve in the night and more than 1 and half hour just to check in and finally to board the aircraft with about 2 hours delay. We had our 2 year old son with us and of course he was upset cause he was tired. When we asked an Emirates employee if we could pass faster cause of the child( as we knew that their policy is families with  little children first)  he just smiled and said I‚Äôm sorry  I can not help you. Second time asked again another one and he didn‚Äôt even answer just walked away! Finally we had to lie to them that we are journalists and we would write about this situation and only then they let us  pass faster through the check in and reach the gate where we had to wait again for long time due to the very slow check in for the rest 200 passengers!
When finally the gate opened they didn‚Äôt let us pass inside with the baby even though we were standing next to the gate in the front. They just said that it wasn‚Äôt our turn yet as our row number was last! Once again we had to remind them the policy of Emirates about babies so after some thought they finally let us board on the plane without waiting for everybody else to pass!
The plane staff was excellent as well as the ground staff in Dubai where it was stop over and the staff in Larnaca airport the same.
So my dear Emirates you care more only for your popular and European destinations and don‚Äôt check the rest? Please do so and you will be perfect!"

The fare was a great deal! This is the lowest I was able to get for Emirates.  Why I choose Emirates is because I wanted to experience your airline offering and A380 was the biggest attraction. I personally found the A380 business class seating of Qatar was better than that of Emirates A380. Emirates must have started as an excellent business class offering for A380 at the time of inception, in my humble opinion it needs a major update. 

For my next trip in April 2022 NYC Region to Bengaluru flying business class I booked with Qatar instead of Emirates. The reason I choose Qatar over Emirates is because of their qsuite offering which gives us complete privacy.  And the Emirates A380 business class seat is really not compelling.

And why did I not choose BA, Lufthansa or other European carriers over Qatar/Emirates is because these are identified as high risk countries and I wanted to avoid the additional pain of covid negative test on arrival in Bengaluru. Otherwise I would have chosen BA where the price is more competitive, their Business class seat is almost like Qatar qsuite and they provide the lounge access. 

EK0201 New York to Dubai & EK0202 Dubai to New York
Check-in was quick and smooth, the ground check-in staff and inflight staff was excellent. They really treat customers with highest professionalism and service. Food was served generously. The flight lounge was a great place to have a relaxed time and variation of eats. 
EK0202 was surprisingly late arrival for a long transatlantic flight this is something I did not expect.
A380 business class seat looks outdated needs an update.

EK 568 Dubai to Bengaluru & EK 569Bengaluru to Dubai
This 777 is really very old and the seating configuration is what making me really think is it worth flying with Emirates. Even though this is a shorter flight for me, nevertheless if I have better options from Qatar why should I really fly with Emirates. Also, they did not give the vanity kit for this sector which Qatar gives the vanity kit. 

To summarize Emirate's business class seat, need a major update to be competitive with Qatar, BA, UA. The staff is clearly one of the finest and the very best in the industry. The food services are also one of the finest in the industry. The star attraction for Emirates is A380 and I would consider flying back only if the business class gets an update there is no privacy for A380 business aisle seats. And the 777 business class seat is crowded and really needs to be updated similar to Qatar qsuite, UA Polaris or BA Club world.

Finally, as a resident of New Jersey I do not consider Emirates from EWR as the 777 aircraft has outdated business class seats. I am ready to bear addition airport transportation cost and travel time if Emirates provides an attractive A380 business class offering."

When I came there, the lab guy said they are closed already, he cannot do anything, he sent me back to the check in counter, with all the security stops, explaining myself to 10 different people on the way again. At the desk she told me to wait in line, later on she called the lab, I shall go there again to make the swab. Are you kidding? I felt treated like an idiot in a circus of unprofessionals.

I purchased my ticket on their website Abidjan-Atlanta-Abidjan. On my way back to Abidjan I left Atlanta at 6:50am to JFK on December 13th (with their 2nd party Jetblue). All my documents¬† checked out. I barely made it to JFK and now I am running like a mad man from terminal 5 to terminal 4 since the connecting time is barely an hour and 10 min. I made it to the gate on time. There the Ladies at the gate... very very unprofessional tell me am missing a document ( A declaration form). Now mind you that form once filled out online cost barely $3.00. Yes $3.00! I told them I handed over the document to the guy in Atlanta who told me he was gonna put in the system since it's the same trip right? I should have asked back for the hard copy which I didn't. 

Now I am here arguing at the gate at JFK about a $3.00 declaration form... I tell the lady ok since it's only take 4 min to fill out online I will do it again right away. She told me no and that they are closing the gate. I do it anyway and tried to show it to Her while the plane was still at the gate and some late passengers was boarding. She barely looked at me so I asked to speak to the person in charge. She looked down on me and said with a certain tone I AM THE PERSON IN CHARGE....the plane left.. 

Not I am asking for baggages and she goes your baggage are not on board. We got them here with us. Another lady who was more compassionate (I thought) tells me to go back upstairs and see with the ticketing desk if they can reissue me a ticket for 10pm since they have another flight leaving that same day at 10pm. I get to the ticketing desk and theres no one. Not a soul. Then I learned they will open at 5pm unless I want to call the number they provided at the desk. Now mind you it is 10:58am. So I called after 45 min waiting time I get someone on the phone telling me they cannot reissue me a ticket for the flight leaving at 10pm nor the one leaving in the next day or the day after the next day.... but they have an open seat in business class if am willing to pay $5,000 more... I don't have that kind of money. The guy on the phone tells me in a very cold way well sir theres nothing we can do for you. You gonna have to make arrangements by yourself.

Now I decide to go retrieve my baggage üß≥.¬† LORD I had no idea of what was going to happen to me. From noon to 6PM no one can help me retrieve my bagages. I talked to people from emirates and all I get is we reopen at 5pm. Am walking üö∂üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è in the airport like a crazy man. A woman from Avianca tried to help me out by directing me to people she thought could be of help.. but she was disappointed on how emirates can treat a customer like that... she finally directed another me to this guy from emirates and told me to go talk to him. As soon as I reached to this guy he looked at me weirdly and said I cannot help you. my shift is over and am waiting on someone to pick me up... THAT'S IT! 

It 5:30pm no need to tell you I won't make it to Newark. Another ticket lost... finally at 5:45pm I can talk to a so called manager. Name on his tag was AMR. The man barely listened to me. They treated me like some trash. On the verge of crying because I couldn't understand how EMIRATES that I heard so much about was treating me like that. When I was about to give up I finally came across another guy from emirates ALI. This gentleman man listened to me even I was screaming, yelling because extremely frustrated. He remained calm and very very professional and said to me: sir I am very sorry they shouldn't have treated you that way. Since 10:58 AM TILL 6PM... this guy retrieved my baggage and handed over to me in less than 10 min. Yes less than 10 min. 

Obviously I can't make it to Newark so had to purchase another ticket and was lucky enough to find one leaving JFK at 11:30PM terminal 1 Turkish Airlines Via Cotonou (Benin) to Abidjan, Ivory Coast at $1,245 plus $290 since I was checking a 3rd bag. I landed this morning safe and sound at 12:50AM.

We eventually boarded a bus with all doors open and the A/C going full blast and then we waited for a good half an hour whilst some other 60 passengers boarded the bus including several economy passengers. It was freezing cold and the bus ended up waiting at least a further 10 minutes during which no additional passengers boarded with all the bus doors remaining open. We were then taken out to the aircraft and as some 60 passengers all tried to board the aircraft at the same time we were left standing outside in the freezing rain / snow and boarded finally right at the end. Whilst boarding a second bus with economy passengers arrived simultaneously at the rear of the aircraft. All in all it was a thoroughly chaotic and unprofessional way for Emirates to take care of their first class and business class passengers.!! 
Throughout the whole flight both my wife and myself were cold on board and needed blankets. To summarise a very poor performance by Emirates and not the first time we have had problems with them - the other main situation was no pick-up in Dubai by limousine to take us to our flight to Australia which created an issue obviously.

Needless to say, this was the worst flying experience I have ever had and will not be flying on Emirates again. I also would not recommend this flight to anyone unless I suppose you purchase a seat in first class, hopefully you get better service than those of us in """"economy""""."

Later on the flight they served afternoon tea ...........we ate our sandwich and waited for our scone to accompany the jam and cream on our trays it did not turn up they came to collect the trays and when we said we hadn't had a scone they really wern't bothered at all considering we now have had no dinner and no scone.
A little later the the flight attendant from first class came down with a tray of sandwiches etc, but it was to late then we were not far of landing ,he did apologise about the service we had received and said it wasn't good enough and he would put a report in about it........so far we haven't heard anything from the airline and we have given them over a week since returning.

1.41182065010071,4.07649946212769,"Emirates Flight Delays",1,"Having never flown with Emirates before my expectations were quite high considering you boast about your award winning services and regard yourselves as one of the top airlines.

The first downfall was at Heathrow airport, when our flight (EK030 @ 15:50) was delayed due to technical issues. Now I know these things happen so I wasn‚Äôt too annoyed at the time, my only concern was relating to my connecting flight in Dubai. 

My first step was to call your customer services help line where I was greeted by a rude member of your team who was no help at all. He wasn‚Äôt the slightest bit interested in my concern and just suggested that I should find the airline desks located somewhere within Heathrow departures. 

I made my way down to the airline desks to look for an Emirates representative to speak to however to my surprise there was no one to be found (quite poor taking into account that you had just delayed a flight for a considerable amount of time). Thankfully a lady from a well known UK airline - clearly an airline that had their act together, was there to assist. She suggested that if we went to the Emirates lounge we may find someone who can help. 

Arriving at the Emirates lounge we were informed that if we missed our connecting flight it would be rearranged for us, but we would have to speak to someone in Dubai. So off we were sent to wait, still none the wiser of what was going on. We were then called to our gate and made to queue for 30 minutes so that our previous boarding card could be confiscated and we could be issued with new ones for the later flight (@ 7:30) which was almost 4 hours after our original. Bearing in mind we had already sat in the airport for 3 hours so we would now have to wait 7 hours before even getting on a plane. 

Settling into the flight I was relieved that we were finally on our way. We had paid to select our seats for the flights however because we weren‚Äôt on our original this did not apply ¬£280 down the drain - which I assumed Emirates would refund me but there has been no mention of this. We had been shoved at the back of the plane by the crew seats who were making noise and swapping seats every 10 minutes to take it in turns eating dinner. There wasn‚Äôt one member of staff on that flight who was polite to us, at one point I asked to buy a bottle of water and I was told I couldn‚Äôt, but they would get me a cup of water instead. 30 minutes later, after having to ask 3 more times they brought over my cup of water that was barely a mouthful shortly followed by what they described as food - it was terrible.

After arriving in Dubai we went straight to the Emirates desks. We were told by another unhelpful and rude member of your staff to wait in a queue, so we did. 40 minutes later we reach the front of the queue and explain what has happened for them to tell us to go to a different desk and (surprise) queue again. This time it took us well over an hour to reach the front of the queue as people were pushing to the front. However the Emirates staff told us that they were allowed to push in because they were ‚Äúbusiness class‚Äù customers leaving me feeling rather angry.  The lady issued us with new boarding cards again in two random seats on the plane. We had to argue this to get our seats next to each other - still not the double seats we had paid for but better than nothing. 

When we finally reached Mal√© matters only got worse. Due to a result of your delays we were too late for our hotel transfer that had been organised for us. We had to travel to a different hotel to spend the night, which was no where near as expensive or as good as the one we had booked & paid for. The following morning we had to wake up early to travel back to the airport to then catch the transfer to the hotel we had booked. 

All in all Emirates had cost us 30 hours of our lives that we will never get back, all the hassle and stress that went along with it, a full day of our rather expensive holiday whilst also being rude, unhelpful and quite frankly unprofessional.

Then the agent sent us to Area 5, where there was no one to help us. Since time wasn't on our side we wandered to Area 3 where we stumbled across Omar. 
We did our best to stay up to date with covid rules, but apparently missed the fact that a few days prior they changed the covid test rules from 3 days to 1 day if you're entering the US. The reality was, if not for Omar, we would've missed our flight from Dubai to Newark, and would've either had to wait another day, or fly into an airport we didn't want to fly into. But Omar's quick thinking had us taking a rapid test, and riding through the airport on various vehicles to catch our flight in time. The airport is huge, and our gate was about a 35 minute walk from where we were. And did I mention that we are a family of four with two young kids that don't care for all those long walks?

I never thought I will write such a review for any airline but emirates seem to cheating passengers and collecting money by issuing tickets on flights that they never plan to fly. 

Since it has happened more than once I think this is a organised planned strategy to make money from naive or unknowing customers.

Strategy 1- Take booking, get money on passenger preferred dates example on Saturday, then say flight cancelled flight and move the tickets to Monday or a day where originally the fare was lower.

Strategy 2- Issue ticket, cancel flight and force for refunds. Refunds will take time and emirates can make money without moving a finger. I.e. just selling tickets which they never had plan to fly..

We selected seats with extra leg room and a facility for a bassinet. Our flight on the way was amazing and the male crew member thst was looking after our section was amazing. He completely understood our sons difficulties with autism and flying. He was so supportive and let us know how our son did so well. 
However on our return flight to Manchester EK019 14:30 pm departure was quite difficult as our son had started to play up and he was finding it hard to stay in his seat so instead he was lying down infront of our seats. We chose extra leg room seats incase our son stared to struggle. We were then approached by a female crew member who was very rude. Her name started with CH and her surname started with B. I would guess she was from the South Asian region, possibly India or Sri Lanka. She proceeded to tell us that I should control my child he is not allowed to lie down on the floor. I informed her that he is autistic and is struggling to sit in his seat. She then told me autistic or not it is my job to control my son. She told me I had to put him in his seat and put his seat belt on. I knew this was impossible for him on a 7 hour flight. I became really anxious and conscious after this and scalded my poor son who was just struggling to stay seated. I found her behaviour ignorant and rude. 
As we came to land another crew member who had blonde hair I would guess was europeon. She was so lovely and kind.

1.91790390014648,3.64449739456177,"Emirates Covid Refunds",1,"What was supposed to be our first flight on Emirates is now our last! 

My wife and I met in Seychelles after being separated by the pandemic for roughly 2 years. We had planned to return to the Philippines where she is a citizen afterwards. Emirates was our first departing flight with two connecting flight after. 

Upon check-in at the desk, the Emirates supervisor on duty prohibited me from boarding the plane. She said I couldn't board because as a USA citizen I needed an existing visa. We attempted to explain that Philippines Bureau of Immigration allows a visa on arrival for foreign spouses traveling with their Filipino spouse under the Balikbayan program. We showed our original apostilled marriage certificate as proof. 

The supervisor stated their system indicated that I had to have a visa and that these provisions were not listed. We attempted to show multiple IATF resolutions that the Balikbayan program had resumed for several months, but she stated their system was updated daily with COVID restrictions/entry requirements. She added if I was allowed to board I'd likely be offloaded and deported in Dubai at our next flight. So, we agreed to follow up with the Philippines Bureau of Immigration. When asked for documentation regarding my offloading, the supervisor indicated she couldn't provide this and that I'd have to make an online complaint. 

We were able to confirm by phone and email from the Philippines Bureau of Immigration that I should be allowed entry under the Balikbayan program. We then showed this documentation to different Emirates supervisors at the airport who expressed confusion as to why I was prohibited to board in the first place. They agreed to independently confirm with Emirates airport staff in Philippines and the airport immigration officials. After they did, the airport supervisors confirmed we could rebook our flights and I would be able to board. 

HOWEVER, we incurred thousands of dollars of extra travel expenses while obtaining this confirmation. And other airlines refused to refund us our tickets without documentation as to why I was prohibited to board. When I requested this documentation from the online complaint system, I did not receive a clear response about the matter for 10 days. And that response added that the Balikbayan program didn't apply to me since I wasn't a Filipino even though I had already provided them emails from the Philippines BOI and the Emirates airport staff confirming I should be allowed to travel. 

I spent the next month continuing to email, resubmit documentation, and call anyone at Emirates who'd listen without any success. I did not receive any corrected documentation about the offloading, any financial compensation or flight credits, not even an apology acknowledging their initial mistake! Each time a Mr Ayman Nasser continued to cordially reiterate the following:

""""it is the passengers' responsibility to ensure that they have obtained all relevant exit and entry visas and other necessary travel documents for their journey, including any health requirements."""" 

And. . .

""""We respect your feelings and believe we have taken the matter seriously and sought all available information related to your claim. . . whilst I regret that you remain disappointed with our response and we regret that your expectations have not been met once again, we have nothing further to add other than to thank you for writing to us and for allowing me to restate our position."""" 

 International travelers, especially Filipinos, should beware flighting Emirates! They're playing the role of immigration without the knowledge or authority to do so. We had to extend our time in Seychelles for more than 3 weeks trying to resolve this matter. I have yet to receive refunds for other flights we had to cancel and travel insurance has indicated this is not likely to be covered. This was a huge financial hardship in our early marriage. 

The online complaint system for Emirates is a travesty of a mockery! You can only upload 2 documents at a time. And you can't make multiple submissions without waiting for Emirates to reply. A week or two later. There's no one you can talk to about matters like this by phone either! I asked to speak with supervisors and managers multiple times without any success. Each time they (the call center, the airport staff, the city office) referred me to the online complaint system.  It was so useless I don't even know why they brothered to send me delayed replies. They didn't address any concern or ever explain why the airport supervisors could approve me to rebook and board but the online customer service could make say something completely different.

I hope everyone separated by the pandemic makes better choices for airlines than Emirates.

I have to admit that I am lucky to have only flown in Business class or First class so this perhaps modifies my view slightly. The cabin crew have always been very good on all of the flights we have made; the food and drink quality has been very good.

Where Emirates disappoint is in relation to some of the simpler things that they should always get right.
For example, it does not help that everything is centered on Dubai; there should ideally be regional offices in some of their main destinations, so sometimes resolving a problem is more difficult than it should be. Everything seems a little impersonal but I guess you are just another number to them.

Call center staff although no doubt multi-lingual, do not appear to fully understand issues when described to them so it can be difficult explaining things to them.

Then again, Business Class is the dope. Well First Class really is, but I'm still trippin happy. Guess my only complaint would be that I couldn't select my seat for some reason through their app or website before my flight. As soon as I could check-in I could select the seat, but by then all the window seats were gone. I did get a bulkhead seat that is usually reserved for passengers with infants which had extra legroom. It was near a couple storage closets where flight attendants gathered to get things, so it was a bit busy around my seat but extremely eye pleasing nevertheless. Emirates Business Class!!! Pounded all kinds of great food, slammed some tasty champagne and gin, and enjoyed some friendly, professional service from those nice flight attendants.

And if it had been an evening flight, this is important, as the Qatar lounge has a restaurant, so you can have a full meal before take off, allowing longer to sleep. We had standard business seats in an A380. Very comfortable, but your feet go under a table in the row in front, and I found myself a little cramped for space. The Qatar A380 seat is better from this point of view, and the Qsuites are a further step up (although not available on the A380). Food and drink are excellent, and the bar at the back is ideal to while away a couple of hours between films, of which the selection was exceptional.

I stood up and asked him to stop and as he was sitting next to an adult I assumed this was his parent but it wasn't, nor was anyone in the section of the plane, even the steward didn't know who his parents was until much later and they were in the section behind us, fast asleep, whereas my husband and I got NO sleep.  The steward and even the Head steward did nothing to help me, apart from trying to reason with the unruly kid, which didn't work.  When I wrote to the Head Office to ask why children so young were not sitting near their parents and could I be compensated by having the ¬£200 extra that we paid returned, my question was never answered and I never got compensated.  It was a night flight and I got no sleep, neither did many in that section.  By the time I left the plane, apart from being very pleased to get off that plane, my back was killing me.  I have been a nurse for 42 years and have a `nurse's back' from all the lifting I have done', I could barely walk off the plane, and I was in tears.

Now they tell me.  When the boy and his younger sister weren't kicking the back of our seats, they were running around the plane, playing cowboys & Indians.

We decided to try Emirates for our last vacation to Maldives.

We tried both economy and business class, flew economy from Rome to Dubai, business from Dubai to Male and business all way back.

Overall was a good trip, now the service and the staff is much better on the flights between Rome and Dubai and not as good on the flights between Male and Dubai: cabin crew is much more polite on the first leg, the food is also much better. 

Now comparing to Qatar there were less complimentary offers in the business class, for example we didn‚Äôt have personal amenity kits with moisturizing creams and lip balms, but hand creams were available in the bathrooms, socks and eye mask were provided. 

We truly liked the complimentary driver offer on our way back, it was very nice to have someone waiting for you at arrivals, helping with the luggage at no additional cost. 

We also liked the airport of Dubai, found it much nicer than Doha and Abu Dhabi. It has much more choice for shopping, more food options and is more cosy for our taste. 

Also the lounge that one can purchase the access in the airport is much better than Oryx that I described here, it is much bigger and not as bright as Oryx so allows for the best rest:

Then, together with the weight payment receipt they gave me my boarding passes and informed me that unfortunately Emirates does not have a business class lounge in Jkt airport and they don‚Äôt have any agreement with those existing, so they ask you to arrive 3 hours before the flight and then, even if you fly business, you are not even entitled to use a biz class lounge‚Ä¶ absurd.

We all arrived at the airport at 8.00pm for our flight. We had all our paperwork in order - Covid PCR Tests, Covid Vaccinations, Tickets and Passports - we are all British Citizens. 

On checking our paperwork an Emirates Staff member Alvin (I do not know his surname) stated that we would not be allowed to fly as we were trying to evade quarantine in the UK by going to Switzerland first. He also stated that as the UK had left the EU we required visas to travel to Switzerland. 

I clearly stated to Alvin the following: 1. We were legally allowed to travel to Zurich as we were fully vaccinated and met all the Swiss Entry requirements. 2. British Citizens do not require visas to enter Switzerland 3. We were staying in Switzerland for 13 nights (14 days) 4. We could legally go to the UK from Switzerland - indeed where we went after Switzerland was not his or Emirates concern to be frank. 
We were pulled aside and outside the queue and our passports were taken away. 

We then repeated the facts above to the supervisor and asked them why we were not allowed to check in our bags. She stated that she had to get authorisation from Dubai despite me clearly stating the facts above to her also. We were left waiting until 11.15pm (over 3 hours) until we were finally checked in. 

This was a very unpleasant experience for my family and I and especially my children. We were made to feel like we were breaking the law. We were not offered any chairs to sit on or any water to drink. We simply had to stand and wait as our fate was decided. It was a very very unpleasant experience and caused us unnecessary stress and tension. Emirates is rated as an excellent airline and that is why we chose them and we also chose to fly in Business Class - the treatment we received was anything but premium. I hope no one else has to go through a similarly terrible experience."

I travelled to UAE on 10th with Emirates Airlines, and the following is my review;

CHECKING IN - 5 STARS. 
Was amazing thanks to the two lovely ladies I  found who even tried to remind me not to include perfumes in my hand luggage. Am a frequent traveller, I know this, but I really appreciated them for this, I just wished I would remember their name. But good job ladies. 
Some other two ladies also helped clear the traffic by sending the economy class passengers to check in at the business class checking in centre. This was really good. Helped clear the pathway and eased on the flow of passengers. Really really amazing.

BOARDING - 3 STARS
Their was a large number of passengers and the line was soar. Thumbs up to the 2 ladies handling the huge number because they were rushing to board passengers to the buses before the buses taking passengers to board the plane. (I wish I knew their names, I'll be keen on names next time) They really did well, but the only let down was that the buses took long to arrive to take the next passengers. I feel like Emirates should ask for terminal 1 for operations rather than terminal 2. Mainly because they get large number of passengers.  

For those who dont know, terminal 2 on JKIA works from the ground level and could be somewhat of a disadvantage if one is taking a big plane like Boeing 777-300 which Emirates uses. Transporting passengers to plane boarding becomes cumbersome because of the distance. In cold weather, people get angry. So do something about this. 

EMIRATES CREW ATTITUDE - 2 STARS
The crew never smiled at us. They only smiled when we entered the plane and we alighted from the plane. I see this as being very fake. I understand the job is not easy and is very tiresome especially when it comes to serving food to almost everyone on board. But a smile goes all the way. In fact a few Arabic hostesses were very rude, they were commanding rather than serving the passengers. 

FLIGHT LEAVING, 5 STARS
The flight left right in time there was no delay. Thumbs up. 

LEGROOM - 3 STARS
To people like me, I have long legs, I fel like we are always disadvantaged when it comes to legroom.  But it was fair in Emirates. The best so far for me. 

FOOD - 5 STARS. 
The food was amazing, right from the starter to main course and dessert.  Very delicious.  The drinks amazing. But the hostesses couldn't give me a proper refill on my drink. And they couldn't give me a whole 1.5 litre drinking water to myself. Do something about that. I would never like to disturb a crew by asking for water every time, so if you could give me a bottle to stay with, would be very amazing. 

All in all  a 3 STARS is okay. 

Thanks."

I had two tickets for this flight on 13 July. On 4 July, I was informed that Emirates had canceled the flight. I contacted Emirates customer services and asked about any alternative flight, and they answered that they could not do it. They proposed later flights on 16 July, but it was impossible for us because we had visas valid until 14 July. I told him about it. So, they suggested requesting a refund, I did it, but they refunded a small percentage of ticket costs. I had two two-way tickets that cost 800 USD each. They refunded  188 USD for one and 250 USD for another for one-way tickets. Then I knew that Emirates for such a canceled flight suggested Turkish airlines, but the customer service DID NOT suggest this option for me. I have screenshots of these text messages. I am very disappointed that Emirates canceled the flight and did not suggest how to fly from departure to the final destination. Besides, they refunded not the full amount of one-way ticket costs. I wrote feedback-complaint several times to Emirates, and they answered that the flights had been canceled according to the OAE government and could not help me.

First, we thought the crew members on board forgot clearing our trays and even a neighbor called thrice, no one showed up until way later the crew finally came.

The seats themselves were extremely comfortable, with the seat and ultimately the bed, fitting my broad shoulders so I was able to comfortably sleep (for a change) on a long-haul flight. The design, layout, lighting and airflow were unmatched by any other airline we have flown to date. The privacy door was a welcome bonus that allowed us to stay in our own little world for many uninterrupted hours. The pajamas and socks were soft, warm and comfortable though the temperature was left a bit high for me personally even with the vents fully on. Other amenities that were a lovey touch were the colognes and perfumes, lip balms, lotions, eye patches, and masks to name a few, in beautiful black cases with leather or gold accents according to gender. Slippers were also soft and comfortable though a small foot may have trouble walking around as they were a man‚Äôs size 10 or so. There were fresh roses and orchids in each suite. Just in front the tv was a beautifully designed collapsible vanity set with lighted mirror and off to our left, a collapsible mini-bar. The wood-grain polished d√©cor made for a truly elegant touch to the suite. The TV was the largest we have seen on any plane and the touchscreen, featured ipad and wired remote were all conveniences designed with the passengers comfort in mind. There was also a basket of goodies waiting for us in our suites with a bottle of hand sanitizer. Dom Perignon was offered as soon as we got on board and Arabian coffee with a fresh date.

We signed up for showers before take-off and we had 20 minute slots. We all choose times 1 to 2 hours before landing. Which gets me to the bathrooms. This was the biggest bathroom we have ever been on in a plane, with ample room to move around, no knees knocking into walls. D√©cor, cleanliness and convenience gets an A+. There were shaving kits, colognes, lotions, bath-caps and the shower itself was a 15-minute limit, hand held or not, surprisingly decent pressure for a plane and you could easily control the temperature.

While in the queue to the final checkin my documents which were all in an envelope fell and I could not find my residence permit from that point so I was not allowed to board the flight ; which I understood. 

I contacted the relevant airport authorities for assistance with no success. The next day I contacted the border authorities in Dublin and was told to inform  Emirates airline to contact the border authorities for further instructions. EMIRATES OFFICIALS IN ACCRA quickly dismissed that request insisting they are not able to do that even when I showed them the email from the border authorities in Dublin. TheY were completely dismissive and unsympathetic towards my plight. I asked for an official email address so I could forward the email I received to the relevant Emirates airline authorities for help but I was told by the Emirates authorities in Accra that EMIRATES AIRLINE HAD NO OFFICIAL EMAIL CUSTOMERS COULD REACH OUT TO FOR HELP. 

Out of frustration I called Emirates in Dubai and a travel consultant called PATRICIA was helpful on the phone. My issue was taken up and resolved but unfortunately I still needed the help of the EMIRATES AUTHORITIES IN KOTOKA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT for complete resolution and that was the climax of poor customer relations.

On the day of my travel EMIRATES ACCRA needed to alert Dubai and Dublin of my coming due to my missen permit. I reported to the authorities and surprisingly I was asked to pay for call credits being used by the officials to contact the relevant authorities of the various destination. In shock I asked if again EMIRATES HAD NO OFFICIAL TELEPHONES IN ACCRA. After a heated exchange I was allowed to check in.  In general I had a bitter experience with EMIRATES ACCRA and I think THE EMIRATES AIRLINE NEEDS to get an official email address that customers could contact in difficulties such as mine ."

Even if you don't use these services you have to eat and spending 15 hours you will also shop. This is just too much of greed on their part.

The drivers escorted us to the first class check-in and within 5 minutes we were heading to Security.  We were directed to the electronic gates and just like that we were through and into the terminal. We proceeded up the escalators to the Emirates First Class Lounge which was located next to Gate 17.  On the other end of the hallway was the Business Class Lounge.

As you enter the lounge we were greeted by the Purser, then a water fountain and then a row of bookshelves.  Past that were rows and rows of seats stretching what seems like the full length of the terminal on one side and then additional seating, restaurants, a spa, a quiet room and a private area for special VIPs.  There were multiple bars and coffee stations spread out throughout the lounge. You could even find a shoe shine stand opposite the spa.  The spa provided free 15min massages, but you have to book in advance.  My daughter and I got the back massage and my spouse received the foot massage. It was well worth it.  Special shout out to the awesome masseuses Rea and company.

After walking around a bit I encountered Rehab Ali Saleh (the Purser) and had a wonderful chat.  She offered to give us a tour of the Lounge and we quickly agreed.  She was professional and extremely courteous, answering all of our questions and making sure to point out every detail of the Lounge (much of which I missed during my own walk around). It was such a pleasure chatting with someone who understood the value of quality service and what it means to some Customers. 

After finishing the tour my Spouse and I decided to have breakfast in the restaurant.  The assortment of bread arrived quickly and was warm and fresh. We had fresh squeezed orange juice along with strong cappuccino, a warn prawn dish and a full omelet breakfast.  It did take a while to come, but once it arrived the food was warm and very tasty.

The only down side to the Lounge was that we did not hear any announcement for the flight and by the time we left the Business and First Class line was a bit longer than expected.  However, our friendly Purser found us again and chatted with us to the door of the plane.  She had mentioned us to the Flight Purser and we were greeted at the entrance to the aircraft by name and escorted to our seats.  This was the beginning of an extra special flight back to the United States.

Thank you Emirates for a most memorable flying experience."

Both lounges are next to each other and right above departure gate A7. We were flying on Emirates but The Emirates Lounge opens at 6:20pm and we were at the airport at 12noon. We decided the Maharajah was a much better option than staying in an airport seat for 6 hours. Air India‚Äôs Maharaja Lounge closed at 6:30pm and we moved next door.

The Maharaja was very small but comfortable enough (armchairs only no couches). There were snacks including wraps but no hot food and of course coffee and drinks (no alcohol). It was also very quiet with very few people, so that was a blessing.

The Emirates Lounge by sharp contrast was large and accommodating. Beautiful interior design, and exceptional food and service. There was a large variety of dishes both hot and cold and a great assortment of hard and soft drinks and dessert. The lamb, the ravioli and a shrimp and pasta dishes deserve special mention.

The only downsize to the lounge was by the time the announcement was made in the lounge and we arrived at the gate, they were already boarding economy so we had to weed through a large crowd to get to the only line boarding all 3 groups of First, business and priority. I almost lost the rest of my family! In any case we made it through quickly enough and the greeting at the entrance of the plane where we were addressed by name dispensed all stresses.

We booked as a family our annual leave to our home country on 1st July, and of course due to the demand they provided A380 aircraft where it was fully booked the boarding process took them long time leaving passengers in the middle of no where even families with small kids like our family we were suffering without any help from anyone of the airline. During airport procedures I was injured with a small finger cut so once we are in the air after switching off seat belts sign I pinched the attendant button, and for 40 min no one came (???!!! Emirates ????) to the limit I went to attendants place to request band aid. Adding more I have a boy and a girl where one got served with kids food and the other not for 30 min till I stood up again and requested for the food, and the answer I was provided that ‚Äúsorry the oven is broke‚Äù this was really shocking as a response from an attendant, they even don‚Äôt know the customer service basics. And you know why? 2 rows behind us another family who never served with kids food till before landing with 40 min. And the mother was very angry with Emirates.

I had to take the same airline traveling back to Dubai for some work and I hoped to have a different experience, once I approached the check in counter I was informed that the flight is delayed with 105 min, and imagine when the flight took off ?? Delayed more with 150 min. I lost all my next day work meetings and had to postpone everything due to their mistake. I was really angry and I wrote to customer service to compensate such loss who took them 2 days to reply my complain explaining how they are aiming for best customer service and trying to be number 1 and by the end they told me nothing and no compensation. 
I still have 2 flights already booked with them and really this will be the last time I will think flying with such bad attitude and service. With the money we paid we could go in business class for another airline with transit. I wish y booked flights with them will be safe as I don‚Äôt trust Emirates anymore."
5.42921781539917,10.4305381774902,"Emirates Air Travel",5,"I always wanted to travel via Emirates to complete my tally of """"ME3"""" airlines and finally got the chance to experience it. Although before the trip a lot of frustration and confusion prevailed primarily driven by UAE government's decisions but that is a separate topic and not for here.

The first leg was aboard A380. The checkin experience was quick and smooth. Within 2 minutes I had checked in my luggage and got the boarding cards. The boarding experience it was a bit confusing as there was no obvious instruction or person to guide if the business or 1st class PAX should proceed to the waiting area before the gate and all others should wait.

A380 was fantastic, very relaxed leg room for person of my height (5 ft 8 in). Unfortunately the seat I chose (despite carefully reading through seat charts) was at front tip of the wing and my downward view was blocked. The IFE (which I usually dont consider as important and dont count as a factor in reviews) was good, with large screen and good selection. However the feature which shows flight info on map was mediocre and not as good as I expected. Lunch was serve around 1h into the flight and two main course options were there. I took the chicken in creamy mushroom sauce with mashed potatoes and it was pretty good. The dessert was also amazing. Overall portion size was above average and taste good. The snacks served later though were 'meh' at best (dont think popcorn is a good option). The overhead bins at A380 are also large and spacious. I never was fascinated by A380 but this flight revealed to me the benefits it brings compared to other widebodies.

The transit at Dubai airport was quick and smooth. I was surprised not to see any crowd at hand carry scanners (probably mid night not much load). The airport itself is clean and good but does not give the same premium look as Doha.

The 2nd flight was aboard 777-300ER and this one was also pretty good. The boarding experience here was far better than at Vienna. The flight departure had been delayed by nearly 35 mins but we still manage to land at destination 15 mins ahead. The food on this flight was also good like before although it was not really """"breakfast food"""" (at least one of the options I took). Aboard 777, IFE seemed to have some limitations but was otherwise pretty fine.

Aboard both flights free masks and hand sanitizers were offered. Crew at both legs was really nice and polite. The cockpit crew sounded pretty energetic in their announcements. An interesting feature not found on many other airlines is the camera view from tail and nose of aircraft. That is an interesting feature despite the fact that stream is of poor resolution and of no use at night.

I really understood with this trip why Emirates is considered a top airline and why A380 is appreciated and loved. I would definitely fly more with Emirates if the fares in future are as competitive as this time around. Usually they happen to be the most expensive among ME3 (EK, EY, QR). When considered for value for money, I would still rate QR slightly ahead of EK because of fair differences but on absolute terms, totally recommended to fly Emirates."

I asked him where is floor manager from emirates ? he said hes not here and he cant do anything for you even if hes here, I asked him i want to speak to a manager, but he didnt reply and left his seat without coming back (check the airport cameras) then another team member referred a supervisor his name is ahmad, ahmad had the same attitude and he told me wait i will check with Dubai office, then after 2 hours of me standing at the window he said Dubai office refused it and you are not allowed on flight, I was really pissed and what made me more angry that one of emirates stuff came to ask me what's wrong and why i was so red, i told him the story he told me if you can pay 100 USD i will ask one of my friends to fake the report and get you on the flight, but i refused to do so and I had to go book another flight on Egypt Air for the same destination to Dubai at the same night for another 1,500 AED and I WAS ALLOWED TO ENTER TO DUBAI . the office you have in cairo is a disaster and this situation gave me an example how not to travel with Emirates again NEVER, I will trade the luxury of your flights with a better communication and humble stuff on other airlines.

Briefly, In JFK, the staff were so unprofessional that they placed my baby in dangerous conditions. I have a 17-month-old baby, and we were waiting in line for more than 90 min. Also, we asked several times for a faster procedure, but they refuse to help us while we have a tiny baby, and they placed my baby in a serious chance of getting COVD. The fly emirates keep us more than 90 min in line and had more than 380 passengers inflight regarding the CDC recommendations. 
In addition, before the flight, I called the fly Emirates to make sure that all the things were set and the bassinet for the baby is confirming. The fly Emirates customer service told me that the basinet is booked and the baby will have the basinet for sure (I mentioned the age, size, and weight of the baby). 15 min after the takeoff, we asked the bassinet, and the flight hostess refused the bassinet in terrible behavior due to the baby's size and asked us to keep the baby on the lap for more than 12 hours. This is ridiculous. Overall, for the bassinet baby that I bought from them and double-checked with them, I did not get anything except threatened me that they would call the police if I asked for a bassinet. Very unprofessional and rude (Video is available for your review). 
So, we kept the baby on our lap for more than 12 hours which emotionally and physically affect us. This is emotionally and physically torturing a passenger for the flight mistake. If they let us know, I will buy a chair or change my flight. In addition, we found that our baby stroller is broken. Oh my god!!!! They refuse to compensate. 
 After that flight, I got chronic foot pain, and my wife got wrist pain.  This is not acceptable at all.
The video of our horrible time during the flight is available, and you can see two empty seats next to me (never offer to us due to ?).
So, I am writing to warn you never fly with fly emirates if you have a baby or kid."

We reached out to Emirates to see if they could reimburse us for the covid tests, or possibly upgrade us to business class for the lost hotel room, but they refused.

Two of the four flights were OK legroom-wise.  I was on the front row so naturally the queues for the toilet spilled into the area in front of me but that was ok and to be expected.

The other two flights were a waste of money, with less legroom having spent money to get extra!  I was next to the kitchen, so naturally trolleys need to be wheeled in and out of that area.  What this means on an Emirates flight is you'll often have three trolleys and five crew members occupying that area at the same time, causing you to tuck your feet under your seat as far as possible for most of the journey.

It was even so bad at one point that a crew member was on tiptoes on one foot while his heel hovered above my foot for 5mins while he chatted to his coworker.

The employees said my test was not valid and it was expired! In very simple way they told me to book new ticket and forget about this ticket! i called my agency then i called Emirates to see what they can do for me, they said yes i have to pay for my ticket, then after i talked to their supervisor, they agreed to rebook me a ticket after 36 hours from my original flight, i had to book hotel in new york then i came back to airport, im still didnt checked in and i guess they will try to do something frustrating, one more thing, i suppose to land in Dubai at night and my next flight to my final destination will be after 22 hours, so, one more night to stay in Dubai, they were telling me i have to pay for my hotel too!

I was massively disappointed by the way everything was handled by Emirates. The gate was only opened at 2:50 am to let us in and there were no announcements made on the delays caused. Travellers were left to figure it out on their own, because bear in mind, we were supposed to start fasting with no lead time on what we were to expect. I was seated in the plane and dozed off because I was extremely tired with all the confusion. Woke up two hours later to see that the plane was still stationery at 5:00 am. No announcements were made to explain the delay to the travellers. All this in the midst of a pandemic where I had to sit 2 extra hours apart from the travel time (without a choice) in a confined space with no social distancing as I had two more passengers next to me. I had to fast and wasn‚Äôt even given a meal until suhoor time was over (which I obviously denied as I started my fast) which was due to the late take off. I understand that delays happen in an airline but passengers have the right to know so they can plan in advance and prepare for their fasting in Ramadan. 

I chose Emirates because other airlines are notorious about causing delays and their unprofessional operations. This experience was mentally and physically exhausting and I would like to raise this complain to the concerned department. I would appreciate if I can receive an explanation as I paid a decent amount of money to travel Emirates due to the trust I have in the brand. I would also like to request a refund or an alternative solution to resolve this issue."

My husband and I attempted to redeem a first class itinerary for our round trip. We were told on four different phone calls that no first class service was available for any returns to the US on 3-24. Because of this and our concerns over Covid we reluctantly booked seats on the new 2-2-2 configuration business class return. When we boarded the plane (with no prior notice) we were told that at the last minute the airline changed to a 777-300 and were shown to a middle and aisle seat immediately adjacent to the bathroom. This middle seat is next to a complete unknown passenger with a persistent cough. This could not be a worse seat for Covid safety or comfort. The seats are of horrible quality and the cabin is full. When we brought up our high level of concern about the unfairness of the airplane switch and our safety to the cabin crew we pointed out that the entire first class cabin was empty. They responded that the plane was being flown as a two class flight and that corporate always does this and makes people upset. He said our concern was totally justified and he has no idea why this should be allowed to be done. So now after paying a high redemption and searching many times with Emirates  staff to find a safe first class seat we are seated for the next 16 hours surrounded by unknown people in an extraordinarily high traffic area. 

In addition to that, none of our electronics worked and the the turbulence on both flights was worse than any we have experienced (both of us flying 50+ flights a year). 

Avoid Emirates until they can get their act together. COVID has hit everyone hard, but when you re-emerge to such poor quality and no concern for passengers it is even worse.

Phoned booking enquiries and was told I had been removed from the flight as I hadn‚Äôt shared my visa/quarantine documents with the airline, even though they had never asked to see them. Checked the website too and nowhere does it mention sharing this information. Double checked my inbox but had never received a communication from Emirates requesting this information.
At 09.45 I asked to speak with a supervisor and was told to stay by the phone as one would call back immediately - I waited until 15.30.

Ultimately I discovered that because Emirates hadn‚Äôt received the information that they had never requested from me (apparently you need to be a mind reader if you wish to fly with Emirates) they had cancelled my booking on March 8th, a full 9 days before departure. Again I did not receive any communication from Emirates regarding the cancellation, they were happy to just let me turn up at the airport with passport in hand to tell me I couldn‚Äôt board the plane.

We contacted them over 20 times through phone calls/emails requesting at least a deadline to know that our luggage is officially lost so we can re-purchase the lost items. On every occasion they promised that someone would get back to us directly, of course no one ever did! Thinking emails might work but we only got vague replies stating that its still under tracing and asked us to fill a form with the value of all items in our bag and someone will get back to us with either our luggage or to compensate us, but that never happened. 49 DAYS LATER, we finally decided to file an official complaint on their website to which they responded that our bag arrived Dubai airport.

The Emirates A380 is a nice aircraft and offers modern well maintained aircraft and the A380 is a quiet pleasant aircraft to fly on and their business suites with the onboard bar are excellent but this was an economy flight.

As I hold gold status with Qantas this entitles me to use the business lounges and dedicated business class check in service. Emirate offer one of the best business class lounges which I have only found to be beaten by Etihad and Qatar. The lines for checking in for Emirates flights in economy can be long and slow so having a higher status allows you access to business class check in counters and the lounge making the trip much more enjoyable and efficient. 

Now if you have the Emirates APP you can save time and even in economy check in online and get your boarding passes directly to your phone/tablet
The economy seats are 18"""" wide and with a 34 inch pitch, and the leg room is quite reasonable.  there is also an adjustable headrest on each seat which is handy for making yourself more comfortable.

In economy the plastic earphones are pretty ordinary and poor quality so if you have your own I would recommend bringing them. Emirates also provide a blanket and small pillow which is rather thin, but you also can get free toothbrush and toothpaste and the menus offer a reasonable selection of food and drinks.

Emirates economy is definitely an improvement on others premium airlines and leaves airlines like Malaysia Airlines, British Airways, Qantas well behind, but they are not as good in economy as Japan Airlines or Qatar.
The aircraft is large and has a quiet interior and overall I enjoyed my flight 

Emirates provide the ICE inflight entertainment which is excellent and probably the best available in the skies today. There is also a handy drink cup holder in the back of the seat in front of you and there are also outlets to charge your devices and the cabin is clean, with a pleasant ambience.

Dear Mr Groves,
I refer to your recent communication regarding your travel from Madrid to Dubai on 9th January 2021.
As you will be aware Madrid Airport was closed from 9th until 13th January due to heavy snowfall/ice which delayed your travel from 9th January to 13th January. I would like to say how sorry I am for the inconvenience this has caused you. I do appreciate how frustrating this must have been for all passengers booked to travel during this period. 
The flight cancellations during this time were beyond our control and classed as Force Majeure. Unfortunately, we are unable to consider reimbursement  of the 'out of pocket expenses' incurred, however, I would suggest that you refer this matter to your travel insurers who may be able to assist you.
Mr Groves, I would take this opportunity to thank you for your valued support. As a sign of our appreciation I have credited your Skywards account with 20,000 complimentary miles and hope that these will be accepted in the spirit in which they are most sincerely intended. Whilst these are difficult times, we look forward to the pleasure of your company onboard when it is convenient for you to travel again.
Thank you for allowing me to respond.
Yours sincerely

On the same day which is on Feb 3rd there is another flight of this same Emirates which has a short duration which is 6hours they did not reschedule us to that flight and rescheduled for 25 hours flight duration one. Since I have a small kid of 4 year with me the flight timings are inconvenient for me. The 6hours duration ones will be high cost and that will be open for new booking and for us they rescheduled to an inconvenient flight for their own cheap benifits I called Emirates several times and told my situation so they said we could change date and time as per our convenience without any additional amount. As I booked my tickets via an agency only they were able to change date n time of my flight and when they tried it said the tickets are unable to confirm. Now I am planning to cancel my tickets because I want to fly to native according to my convenience and not Emirates convenience.I had thought Emirates had got such a reputation but no it's wrong they cancel the flight whenever they want and they reschedule according to their wish and not for people. This is such a shame on Emirates. Anyways I need my refund for my tickets I even doubt will they give my full refund or will they cheat my money. I just have a bad image for Emirates. One side they will say we can change and reschedule as per our convenience and when we try to book accordingly they say it is unable to confirm so that we will cancel our booking and since it is a last minute ticket booking costs are really high and they know we would pay any amount and book an another ticket which is double the amount of previous booking this is their cheap business strategy. Emirates will be the last option to book tikets for, as there are many other better airlines which is reputed and more customer friendly and they take care of their customer. Emirates is the worst flight service providers in the world."

1.37375402450562,2.70050716400146,"Emirates Baggage Issues",1,"I had heard that Emirates provided amazing experience, so booked a return flight from Auckland to Glasgow to visit my fiance after being apart for nearly 12 months. I originally booked my flight for July 2020, but that was cancelled due to covid-19. So, I decided in good faith to keep my ticket and use it for December 2020 instead. 

At the check-in desk for my flight to Glasgow, I was served by a rude and curt customer services representative who refused to let me carry my laptop bag and a carryon suitcase (despite direct confirmation from an Emirates employee that my laptop bag would not be weighed). She charged me $280 for excess baggage and forced me to check-in my carryon suitcase, and I had no choice but to pay the fee. Apart from that, my journey to Glasgow was ok and the on flight experience was decent. 

The journey back to Auckland in January 2021, however was much more traumatic. I had booked a hotel room at Dubai International Hotel for 6 of my 8 hour transit far in advance, to keep myself safe and minimise the risk of catching covid-19 in the terminal. I arrived on the 18th of January at about 2am to check-in and was informed that my booking, which had been booked directly with Emirates was CANCELLED. This was the last thing that I wanted to hear after an exhausting 8 hour flight near a screaming toddler on the plane. After nearly 2 HOURS, I arrived at an Emirates desk where the employee was inconsiderate and extremely unhelpful. He said, """"What can I do about your booking? I am not the prebooking team, this is Emirates Connect. I can't help you. What can I do?"""" Terrible customer service. Only after I had insisted that my hotel booking had been confirmed, he investigated and discovered that my booking had been CANCELLED ON THE 15TH OF DECEMBER. What I cannot comprehend is how Emirates booked the hotel for me, confirmed the booking and took my money ($198) on the 14th of December. And now, over a MONTH later, they still have not refunded the money they stole from me. 

Because of their incompetence and because I was at the limits of my exhaustion, I gave up and booked a hotel room at the excessive price of $290 for only 3 hours. I was so frustrated, stressed and traumatised by Emirates' mistreatment of myself as a solo female traveller, that I was unable to rest before I had to catch my flight to Auckland. 

I was horrified when I got on the plane to discover that in the economy section, there was NO SOCIAL DISTANCING. There were only 1 seat gaps between people, maximising the risk for covid-19 to be transmitted. This was innappropriately done by Emirates and because I happened to be sitting near someone who tested positive for covid-19, I had to remain locked in my hotel room for 7 DAYS in New Zealand. Even now, 7 days after I've arrived, I am still suffering because of the traumatic and stressful experience that I had. Unless Emirates improves their customer service and treats people with more respect, I will not be booking with them again. I am hoping that I will receive compensation and a refund."

I had a flight to Cairo today, and i wasn‚Äôt accepted on the flight due to the lack of the EVisa, which I don‚Äôt require. Apparently in your system it is written that Montenegrin citizens need EVisa to enter Cairo, which is not the situation at all. I flew to Cairo in September for 7 days, and again in October for 10 days, I flew with Turkish airlines and I never experienced the same issue as with your staff. Your staff said that ur system updates regularly, but the last changes were made in July 2020, so obviously I flew after that period of time, and I was able to obtain the Entry Visa Fee, due to my Nationality doesn‚Äôt need the visa. So there are 2 options, option 1 to get the E Visa, option 2 to get it on the airport, as I used to do in the past 3 months. When I was waiting for the answer, am I gonna be accepted on the flight or no, I was suggested by ur employees to get the ticket from Cairo to Jeddah, cuz than they ‚Äòmight‚Äô let me in. note that I am a resident in Jeddah. I was just about to enter my OTP when one of the girls told me no, we can‚Äôt accept you. What if I‚Äôve gotten it, just in a second of time? Even one of the ladies whose name is Andrea ( refused to give me her last name) with her male colleague who‚Äôs name I didn‚Äôt get actually called ur staff in Cairo airport, the girl name they spoke to is Rehab( as Andrea didn‚Äôt know the name at first, and after my suggestion found it, but still didn‚Äôt know the right spelling even tho I told her I need it for the complaint) They said that I need an EVisa as well. On official site of Wikipedia, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Montenegro it is clearly stated that there r 2 options, that we can get it on entry, as I did 2 times already. I missed an important event in Cairo due to this mistake, and enormous amount of stress, as well as extra expenses for my extra stay in Dubai, and application for an EVisa, and additional PCR test. I am traumatized by this experience, and lack of knowledge, and understanding. One of the comments that I found truly unprofessional was that I should just wait cpl of days until my Visa gets approved, stating ‚Äò why don‚Äôt you just wait, and after cpl of days fly again‚Äô In which I answered Thank you very much for your suggestion, but if I didn‚Äôt have the need to be in Cairo in certain time, maybe I would accept her advice.

The flight from Cape Town to Dubai - was not what we remembered but at least it was ok.  They handed out a """"covid hygenic pack"""" and the staff was attentive.  From Dubai to Male it was a smaller plane - 100% full with no """"social distancing"""" & no sanitizing packs.  Apparently it was the only flight to Male that day.  We arrived at Male & were not allowed to disembark for about 1.5hours due to a """"full"""" airport.  After finally entering the airport we were delayed again by 3hours due to passport control.    

Had a wonderful holiday (will review that later), and then suprise suprise on our return we had another delay at a Packed Male airport of about 2 hours.  (This was apparently because they had to clean the plane for 2 hours‚Ä¶you would never say this once onboard)

We asked the lady checking us in to please try to ensure we had social distance seats to which she said she cannot change any seats as it was already allocated.  We finally board the Emirates plane to take us from Male to Dubai...flight wasnt full, yet the seat us next to other travellers.  I kindly ask the airhost if we could please just move one row back for space reasons...to which he said no, for safety reasons we need to stay in this cramped area & seats on the plane.  Livid...but ok.  Then after a 13 hour layover in Dubai, we go to connections desk & plead for the assistant to ensure that we do not sit next to anyone on this 10 hour flight.  She says that its a social distance flight & no one is next to us.  Happy days.  Until we get onto the plane only to see that once again the flight is not full yet they have seated a single passenger right next to us.  (ps.  no sanitizing packs since the first flight on day one) .  So we move seats to the back of the plane.  This plane was clearly an older one as you could see wear and tear on the inside cabins as well as my TV did not work.  They couldnt move us to another seat here either because of """"covid"""".   This last flight from Dubai to Cape Town was probably one of the worst experiences I have ever had on an international flight...the airhosts & hostesses literally came past twice with food only.  They sat chatting at the back of the plane for most of the flight.  Didnt come around offering any extra refreshments or coffees and when passengers went to the back it was almost like an effort for them to refill some waterbottles.  Out of the 8 toilets on the entire plan for economy & premium economy they """"locked"""" all three toilets at the back of the plane saying that was for crew use.  Even kindly put """"out of order"""" sticker on it so that passengers would move past...only we saw all of them using and flusing all three of those toilets.   Now that pissed me off that in a plane of a couple of hundred people the passengers get to use maybe 4 toilets, and the Cabin Crew of I think they said 14 in total...get to use 3 toilets.  Maybe it was because the 4 toilets left for passengers to use was so disgusting.  No one tidied, or even went in there to sanitize.  Honestly, I have seen cleaner public toilets in 3rd world countries.  (If they had given us sanitizing packs I would of at least cleaned it myself.  No soaps in toilet, no toilet sanitizers etc.)

We paid for an upgrade to business class yet were made to wait at the gate while economy class was boarding...which kind of defeated the objective of business class!

No apology given

At the check in desk the staff member has no idea what was wrong with our seats and proceeded to say we should call Emirates from our mobile phone to resolve while waiting at the desk...further to this he proceeded to use my mobile phone...which is certainly not appropriate in a Covid climate...upon being on hold for soo long he decided to hang up and ask us to ring again

While on hold a 2nd time he decided to leave us at the check in desk and go on his break with no handover whatsoever!!! And just said see my colleague at the next desk leaving us to explain what was going on and why we were on hold! Which we didn't know either! A total embarrassment to Emirates and ourselves 

We ended up resolving this ourselves!!! Before the palaver at the gate as aforementioned 

To clarify matters the flights attendants and manager on board made a special visit to say he was aware we had difficulties on the ground at the airport which confirms the staff were aware they had made a mess of things!

Your manager on the ground 'Kate needs to learn not to speak down to her colleague by saying 'you just stay there and deal with the economy lot' and maybe some training in manners and professionalism...more so if she dealing with business and first class!

We rang Emirates customer service on 03448002777 using an app called WEQ4U at 12:08pm and asked them for an advise. However the gentleman on the phone advised me that it was OK to travel but didn't ask for any flight details. He said something like only babies under 7 days old couldn't travel. The total call time was around 2 minutes. 

After getting confirmation from the Airlines, me and my family reached the airport around 16:30pm and checked in around 1800pm after waiting for our friends. Since the Dr advised not to come in contact with the pregnant lady, i thought i should tell the airline incase any pregnant ladies could be seating near by us. 
However, the lady at the counter went to check with her supervisor and who then contacted Duty officer Allison Webb. 
Allison Webb then came straight to us after talking to her supervisor and said we had not contacted Emirates at all and she could not find any note/transcript on our booking. I tried to explain that we made a call and followed as advised by the Emirates team who didn't ask for our details so there wouldn't be any notes on the booking but Alison kept on talking rather than listening to us. After sometime i showed her the call logs with the GP and Emirates. Despite explaining that i had spoken to customer service, Allison refused to check us in and she went to get an advise from the medical team.
She came back around 19:30pm just to be told that we cannot travel.

Allison made us feel like as if we lied about calling the customer services as she couldn't find the transcript and kept talking over us and didn't listen to us. She kept blaming the Doctor and tried to ignore the airlines fault. After showing the call log of GP and Customer Services, she changed her voice tone instantly and spoke to us nicely.
I told her we could have just not said anything and boarded on the flight but wanted to make sure no other pregnant passenger would be around to which she replied her crew would have picked it up. 
We would have cancelled or postponed our dates if we were advised by the customer services before it was too late. 
We would have not gone to the airport and saved the time and journey and also we wouldn't have  had to wait for the whole evening.
My husband and sister in law had taken the day off to come to drop us at the airport which we could have arranged for our next flight.
We travelled 86 miles round trip to be told we couldn't travel.
It cost me ¬£19 for the airport parking. 
All these could have been avoided only if their customer service team told us we couldn't travel when we called them. 
I later contacted the customer affairs team who said they couldn't refund anything as it wasn't their fault.

However due to some urgent business in Mauritius, we had no choice than to book our travel on one of those weekly flights, believing that our well-being and health would be safe as promised by Emirates booking website.
Arriving at Heathrow Airport Emirates Checking desk, most of the staff had no idea about who were allowed to travel to Mauritius during this period. They had no idea which hotels were participating in the scheme of quarantine on reaching Mauritius. We really felt that they would stopped us from travelling although we have booked our flight according to the protocols as set by the Government of Mauritius. They were very unprofessional, unhelpful and unfriendly. I did produce a list of the hotels participating in the scheme but to no avail. We were asked to wait until they can find out more about which hotels were receiving guests on our arrival in Mauritius although we informed them that we have booked our hotel accordingly. After more than one hour waiting, we were informed that our hotel was on the list receiving guests from that flight. The staff had to get in touch with their colleagues in Dubai to verify that our booking was done accordingly. Very stressful experience particularly during this period of pandemic. They did not show any empathy. We were disappointed with their attitude.

Flying from Dubai to Mauritius, the journey was simply the worst nightmare that you wish would never happen to you or others. First of all, the food was atrocious, not fit for human consumption.  BUT the nightmare began when a number of passengers in our vicinity was not wearing their face mask correctly. Theirs were being worn without covering their nose. Their excuse was that their glasses would steam up. Few of them did not wear their mask at all for sometime. One of them had his mask hanging on his ear for at least 4 hours with the pretext that he was drinking. This passenger was served wine on a regular basis by the staff without asking him at any time to wear his mask properly. On no occasion did other passengers was encouraged or asked to wear their as they should by any member of the staff and we were left at risk and our well-being and health compromised, Emirates breaking their promises of keeping their passengers while travelling with them.
During a heated discussion with a passenger not wearing his mask properly, a member of the crew was called and he was no assistance at all as he could not emphasised to the passenger that it was mandatory to wear their  mask properly. Once again, I was really disappointed with Emirates and their attitude of laissez faire and at the same time compromising  the well-being of every passenger and staff, blatantly flouting the protocols as set to minimise the spread of the virus. The plane was full. In our vicinity, all the seats were occupied. Sad, no one from the crew members did take charge to implement the protocols although they could see that some passengers were not wearing their mask properly.
I have written to Emirates about my nightmare experience and I do wish that they will take the appropriate steps to ensure that these important protocols are put into action."

Today, I thought I would share some of the lying emails that Emirates sent me on September 21 and 28 (see photos) to back up my descriptions of its delay tactics on refunds. The Emirates customer service blockade is really quite simple, they just delay and block all inquiries to any higher level. With only one email address and one phone number -- and no physical address -- it is impossible to personally make a case to anyone more than a """"customer service representative"""" aka receptionist.

When asked if someone from management or the refunds department would contact me, they tell me they are """"quite busy"""". Is this a joke of some kind? Even the most dubious American company has the ability to call back customers with a complaint! Dubai must be quite a mess not to have any phones or available personnel for 4 months now.

Keep in mind my issue is in regards to a fully paid vacation (paid in December 2019) for a family of 4, so we are not talking about a trivial amount of money here.

This has become almost a running joke for my family, as we view this as a variant of the Nigerian prince/princess email scam that plagues unsuspecting suckers worldwide. Instead of a Nigerian prince, we are helping to rescue an Emirati prince with our money held hostage by this airline!

Well, at least I have my credit card company running its own formal dispute now, and its representatives were quite open about the fact that Emirates is trying to do this to many customers so that people just give up or that the credit card company eats the cost of reimbursement as the months (soon to be 1 year) drag on. I wonder if Emirates has any idea of how much goodwill and future business it loses when it treats customers like this in a global economy. Does it not think I am going to tell every co-worker, contractor, consultant, etc. that I know?

Emirates is a third-world airline with a thin veneer of first-world advertising. Peel back the layer of a few business/first class lounge perks and all you have is a state-supported failing airline with an enviable route map. Its piss-poor customer service is a fine example of the real inner workings of this dishonest company.

I handed my passport and COVID test to the airline desk. He was looking at my COVID test and he said it wasn't a PCR which the airline requires. I immediately told him it was a PCR as stated on the certificate. He handed my passport back together with my boarding pass. Emirates has a partnership with Swissport lounge for first and business class passengers but unfortunately, it was closed they should have at least provided something. Boarding started and they begin with the last row in Economy class. Upon entering the first-class cabin I was stunned by how luxurious feel it is. The seat is in 1-2-1 configurations there was a total of 8 First class suites available and only 3 was filled. I was assisted immediately by an airline crew. He hangs my jacket and offered me a drink. He handed me my amenities and pajama. The suite was spacious and comfortable definitely there is enough legroom. You can recline your chair in whatever position you like. I put on my pajama and slipper. This is the older first-class suite the newer once doesn‚Äôt fly to Chicago unfortunately. Airbus 380 is even better because it has its own bar and spa inside the plane. The Suite is enclosed also for privacy. There is also a small bar for drinks. You can order a meal anytime you've liked. The airline crew is always very attentive to my needs. The food also individually wrapped to avoid contamination. Sanitizer, gloves, and masks were also provided.  For my dinner, I order caviar and smoked duck for my appetizer, steak for the main course, and seasonal fruits for dessert. The food was tasty. One of the airline crew was nice he told me we are passing through an aurora borealis I was able to enjoy it, it was an unforgettable experience. After dinner, I recline my seat and ask the crew to make my bed but due to pandemic, they can't do it at the moment. my bed was comfy I was able to take a good sleep. After waking up I press the button to call the airline crew and ready to order my breakfast. I had a basket of fresh bread and an omelet and a cup of coffee. The entertainment was great there was a lot of movies, shows, and music to choose from. You can close and open your door to provide more privacy. The amenity kit is from Bvlgari."

I have traveled with several airlines and never have I had difficulty like this regarding a refund. 700 + customers are waiting for refunds according to agent, so thats 700+ people that have invested $1000 plus dollars that Emirates is simply retaining to pay their staff and useless agents?

2.29414463043213,6.36613750457764,"Emirates Air Travel",3,"Emirates Flight EK404 Singapore to Melbourne

We had a short ‚Äòlong-haul‚Äô flight ahead mid-afternoon departure from Singapore for Melbourne with an ETA close to 01.00 the following day: 7+ h flight then. Check out the safety card ‚Äì we‚Äôre flying on a B777-300ER.
Emirates has a commercial fleet dominated by two widebody aircraft ‚Äì the A380 and the B777. From London through Dubai and on to Singapore we had enjoyed the sense of size and space (and the quietness) of the A380 - the larger of the two aircraft - and then switched to one of the more numerous B777 aircraft. No issue, with around 144 B777s flying and another 126 on order this aircraft is set to dominate Emirates services for years to come.
We‚Äôd booked (and paid the extra) for access to a couple of seats at the rear of the aircraft where there are four sets of two that follow the taper of the fuselage ‚Äì the cross-section is too narrow for the more conventional three seats configuration (there‚Äôd be no space for the aisle). This way we enjoyed the freedom of personal space (such as it is) for coming and going without that third person involved. We had seats 48A & 48B (second row from the last).
The slightly smaller seat profile ‚Äì where you sit and where your knees impact the seat in front of you ‚Äì on the B777 is noticeable when compared to the A380 (if only because earlier that same week we had enjoyed 17-18 h in a couple of A380s). Width and pitch are 25 mm smaller on the B777. Irrespective of how large/small you are, however, when you travel ‚Äòeconomy‚Äô you can‚Äôt really escape contact with your neighbours on either side. Sit at the rear of the cabin, and the sea of heads emphasises the small size of the cabin and the density of the people around you.
Fortunately, you can escape into the ICE screen on the back of the seat in front of you ‚Äì ‚Äòinformation, communication, entertainment‚Äô and learning capture your time if you don‚Äôt have access to a window seat (>1,800 channels, it says). This, however, is where the age/millions of miles flown by our B777 aircraft that day first cropped up ‚Äì in addition to the worn nature of the fabric around you, the hand-held pull-out electronic control was dead. Someone would have known this ‚Ä¶ these things get checked ‚Ä¶ but it had not been replaced. OK, you can use the touchscreen for controlling things ‚Ä¶ only it was insensitive, slow and typically ignored instructions (no matter how you ‚Äòtouched‚Äô it). (We‚Äôd just flown in the much newer A380 ‚Äì with highly sensitive screen touch facilities ‚Äì so the differences were clear.)
Then, because the hand-held unit wasn‚Äôt working, there was no overhead light ‚Ä¶ the unit contains the light switch. Referring this issue to that friendly, but hard-pressed, flight attendant rushing passed, she switched on the light next door (where there‚Äôs no seat) and swivelled it towards the seat. It would not quite cover the tray but was better than no light.
Lunch when it came between 17.00 & 18.00 was OK - we were ready for it (8-9 h since breakfast). The Malaysian-style beef, soy sauce, vegetable curry & rice/tomatoes choice was hot & tasty - the antipasta Asian chicken salad less so ‚Äì slab of stodgy plastic chicken; it remained untouched. The dolce ‚Äì mousse was OK. A sandwich snack was also served just before landing.
The flight was OK too - an impression of an older well-used aircraft and hard-working cabin crew that were carrying/servicing another 360+ passengers into the sky for however long it took. With kitchen and toilets behind us funnelling people and cabin crew, the cabin was busy ‚Äì narrow corridors for hanging around, talking, passing. The flight then was ‚Ä¶ OK.
It was not so much the flight, however, but pre-flight issues at the airport that dominated. The terminal flight board had us chasing around to check-in at counter #03, then back to #11 only to find it was at #13 ‚Äì close to where we had first started. Friendly, but ill-informed people then. Then we got pulled out-of-line for that statistical security/wand-waving check heading towards immigration (why us; what for?). Secondly, there was a hassle with thumb recognition at immigration ‚Äì the machine failed to recognise the thumb. The impatient desk wanted to separate us ‚Äì the one passing through the gate into the pre-flight lounge area - and the other (the one with that unfriendly thumb) in another direction. We complained and were threatened with causing a ruckus, blocking the queue, etc. before the ‚ÄòChief‚Äô at a second window became involved and, waved the pair of us though. Doesn‚Äôt this kind of incident get covered in ‚Äòtraining‚Äô?
Security including x-ray facilities are/is at the entrance to the departure gate/lounge. Limited space, two units and >200 people milling around, some passports still being discretely checked and confusion over whether a bottle of water was ‚Äòallowed‚Äô through. Initially ‚Äòyes‚Äô ended in definitively ‚Äòno‚Äô ‚Äì the bottle did not survive the x-ray machine.
Finally, there were rushed boarding procedures. Business, Club Card carriers and families with little kids took priority ‚Ä¶ except when zone C-F people (furthest towards the rear of the aircraft) were called too early and moved forward to overwhelm the remainder of the others still queueing ‚Äì the ‚Äòfree-for-all‚Äô that largely resulted could probably best be described as ‚Äòrobust loading‚Äô.
Conclusions? Just one more flight in a modern world that (pre-Covid-19) accommodated 100,000 commercial flights each day. Ho hum - and that‚Äôs w/o taking our CO2 and other GHG emissions into account. It had been a reasonably ‚Äògood‚Äô flight notwithstanding mixed services at the airport pre-flight that are best described as ‚Äòaverage‚Äô. Unfortunately, TripAdvisor doesn‚Äôt do ‚Äògood‚Äô.

I booked with Emirates as I had only heard good things about the airline and I thought I could cound on them should there be any problems with the flights. I was wrong.

I'm deeply disappointed by their customer service!

They suspended my flights from Auckland to Dubai, Dubai to Paris but didn't even notify me by email or sms. I only found out about the flight suspensions when I was checking their website. Even the cheapest low cost airlines have send their passengers a notification, even during the times of Covid-19.

When I tried to request a refund or compensation on their website, I couldn't as it was collapsed. So I had to call the customer service and the lady on the phone said I had no right for a refund (which was a lie), as they were obliged to cancel the flights and it was 'not their fault' - it was my fault even less and I shoudn0t have to pay for a service that was cancelled by the provider! Acoording to that lady I shouldn't go for the travel voucher as that would only compensate a small amount fo my money actually spent, due to the fact that I ordered an economy ticket and didn't have the right for a travel voucher of the full amount. Her recommendation was to keep my flights on hold with the right to change flights during 1 year. That was another lie as my reservation has now disappeared from their system when I enter my reservation number (HATPDB).

So I ended up with a cancelled flight from their side, no refund or compensation or what so ever. Stranded in New Zealand that was about to be confined due to Covid-19, so I had to pay additional accomodation costs for 2 more weeks and additional flight costs for my new return ticket within the German repatriation flights, as this was my only way to leave the South Island and get back to Europe during the confinement.

I do not recommend this airline to anybody, as they don't hold up to any expectations and their customer service is a desaster!"

So here is our story: We are a family of three repatriating from Europe to Australia. Navigating the current border restrictions and quarantine requirements from the Australian Government's side is mentally and financially challenging enough for a family with a toddler and one parent without an Australian passport, but Emirates sure did not make this stressful time any easier for us!

On 5 August we booked three Economy class tickets for a trip from 'London' to Sydney for 3 Oct 2020. On 16 August we received an email from Emirates informing us that our tickets had been cancelled. 

The same day, on the phone to the operator we were told that the flight had been cancelled and that due to Australian government regulations there were NO FLIGHTS OPERATING from Emirates to Sydney before the 8 November 2020. We were then booked on what he told us was 'the first flight' into Sydney operated by Emirates (on 8 Nov). 

That same evening, we saw that online Emirates was still selling tickets for 24, 26, 28, 30 and 31 October - but only First and Business Class. So they are actually operating flights in October, contrary to what the phone operator told us. We called Emirates again to ask for an explanation of the situation and a different operator told us that the first flights available for ECONOMY passengers were 8 November but that there are other flights going earlier.

So at least now we know: 
1) Emirates prioritizes First and Business class passengers that HAVE NOT YET booked tickets to Economy class customers who HAVE ALREADY purchased a flight. 
2) When you get bumped from your original flight you will NOT be automatically booked on the next AVAILABLE flight but on the next flight where Emirates is WILLING to reserve some seats for Economy class passengers.
3) Emirates will not tell you the true reasons for why they kick you off the flight you purchased or be transparent about their - in my view -  unethical COVID policies.

So what is already an extremely stressful situation for my family has now become even more stressful as we have no guarantee that Emirates will not bump us off this new flight too, in favour of passengers with more money."

This is a joint review for both Emirates and Opodo. Both companies are in my opinion as bar as each other and don't care about their customers once they have their money.
Myself and my husband both key workers, myself and staff nurse for nhs and my husband a supermarket supervisor were in Australia in March when we received an email from Emirates to say our return flight was cancelled sorry for any inconvenience. This inconvenience being stuck on the other side of the world with not suggestion of them giving is any support to get back to the UK. No contact number given, no email address and not one email from opodo about this cancellation. Our flight was Emirates airline but booked through opodo. Which I will never do again.
We then spent the next week on the phone to Emirates and opodo. To get through to anyone took hours. Sometimes 6+ hours, listening to the most irritating songs for this long certainly did no good for our mental well being.
When we eventually got through to both companies we would the be told by emirates it had nothing to do with Emirates or be told by opodo it had nothing to do with them to contact Emirates instead. The frustration of this was awful. We couldn't get anyone anywhere to help us. We continued to get passed from pillar to post.
By this point the British government had made an announcement that airlines were to allow passengers to transfer to other operating airlines for little to no fee. Again another day waiting for Emirates to answer their phone. Explained this to Emirates and how qatar were currently the only airline operating for us to get home. Emirates uselessly stated that they would allow us to transfer to any airline but for POLITICAL reasons would not allow us to transfer onto a qatar airline flight. This is absolutely ridiculous. They care no amount at all for their customers safety and well being. We were desperate to get home safely. And with every phone call and day passing we got more and more frustrated, upset and scared. Both opodo and emirates have proven to be absolutely useless and their customer service skills are terrible. Once they have your money they could not care less.
We eventually managed to get a flight home which we had to pay full for.
So on the 2nd April we phoned opodo again to start the refund process. At this stage we were informed by opodo that Emirates have stated 90 days will be the wait for any sort of refund. So then began the wait for 90 days.
We are now at day 133. We have since contacted Emirates who say again it's upto opodo. We have also contacted opodo on a couple of occasions, one of which we were told within 3 days we would receive an update of our refund. I was reassured this would definitely happen. SHOCK. No update within 3 days. So another phone call. Yet no further forward as they say they can't do anything until they hear from Emirates.
So currently myself and my husband and ¬£1500 out of pocket as we had to get our own flight home organised. If it had been upto opodo and emirates we would still be stuck in Australia with no accommodation, no money and no wages.
I would advise everyone to avoid both of these companies unless you want to be out of pocket and feel very unsafe on your holiday.
I dread to think how much longer we have to wait for any sort of contact or refund. But 90 days is now 133 days so let's see.
Absolutely useless terrible companies

I was on a flight from Dubai to Zurich in January 2020 (pre-COVID times) and as always had specified the vegetarian meal option during booking. When the time came for food, I was told there was no vegetarian option. I was surprised so I asked if they had a salad or something atleast or perhaps emergency instant noodles. The attendant didn't really seem to care that I had nothing to eat and made absolutely no effort to find something for me despite me asking. This was a connecting flight which was landing late at night after the stores are closed and I had a connecting train to catch so didn't have time to get food. My meal that day ended up being a desert cup and a dry chunk of bread (which I had to ask her to give me from the tray). 
The flight itself is fine but would not recommend at all simply for the quality of service and care and the complete disregard for non-meat eaters."

I originally booked it from London Gatwick however Emirates changed my flights from Gatwick to Heathrow and was communicated timely as well. Till here it was fine but on Monday (3-August) when I was trying to check the final flight status of my confirmed booking, I came to know that there were no flight details available on Emirates website for the same booking. Upon inquiry with my travel agent, I was told that Emirates has cancelled that flight. I was not notified by Emirates for this cancellation unlike previous changes. It was quite shocking and stressful for me and the family. I contacted Emirates London number immediately who also confirmed me that the flight has been cancelled due to operational reasons nothing more can be told. 
Whilst talking to my travel agent he mentioned that I cant book any Emirates flight the same day (17-Aug) although a later date in August could be looked for. Because of this confusing situation I asked the travel agent to either provide me a ticket within same price and a date earlier to 17th August or process the refund as I can't take the travel voucher since it is not feasible for my situation. He was initially reluctant to process the refund but then later agreed for it. Now the worst part of the story, when I checked the Emirates website the same EK002 flight at 14:30 from London is still operating as usual and is appearing as Sold Out. There are 2 questions now on Emirates integrity and reputation. Firstly why was I not informed by Emirates regarding flight cancellation and secondly how come the flight booking show Sold Out or even appearing in booking searches if it has been cancelled and finally if it was cancelled why was I not adjusted in any other +/- 1 day flight. Due to this painful situation I think me and my family are the most impacted people as we have now requested for the refund (which we will get in 8 weeks time). And of course, no one has got GBP 3K now at their disposal, to immediately book other available flights. I can see there are flights to Karachi operating on 12th and 13th as well which are way more than what I actually paid for. I can't even change the arrival dates as a lot of my work and my child's school depends on that. Unfortunately, I have had the worst experience of my life with this lack of communication from such a known organisation. Family is depressed and miserable but now we cant even do anything.

I choose this pretty airlines much exclusively if I can. The number +1-855-{948}-(3661) one reason is they are most often on time. However a close second is that they are a company with a big heart. The staff from check in to flight crew are some of the best! Have I had mediocre experiences, well yes but it's uncommon. Also they often come in with excellent pricing. Finally the two bags fly free can't be beat.

My most recent flight was delayed due to snow. The grounds crew was efficient and cleared the runway with a 15 plow convoy. If you've never seen this it's pretty cool. Also the deicing machine had us taken care of in around 20 minutes. Time was made up in the air and the flight was only delayed 10 minutes into Atlanta.

Airline does things differently and they pride themselves on being a unique caring airline. I think the extra attention provided by the desk agent is indicative of the overall customer oriented culture."

The middle seats of every row were not occupied, in order to maintain social distancing, which made us feel more comfortable and secure. We were also provided with nourishing food, and the veg/non veg options were also taken care of. The overall ambience of the aircraft was very clean and safe, and hence I would recommend all those who want to travel to use Emirates, as I've always had great experiences traveling with them.

We chose Emirates because of the brand and past experiences which was great, however after this experience I‚Äôm starting to doubt the brand itself. 
The first hiccup came up when the transfer booked through Emirates refused to come back to fetch my mom and I. Unfortunately we were delayed by Dubai airport because of coronavirus , our delay was about 5 hours. Which in this case we didn‚Äôt ask for the delay and it was unfortunate that we had to go through that but we understand because of the epidemic. After the horrible 5 hours we proceeded to the Emirates office for assistance, we explained what had happened and they were sympathetic and tried to assist by calling the transfer company as they explained it was a third party providing the service. The third party transfer company said they only wait 2 hours and then they leave due to other work , however we had let them known about the delay and tried further explaining the delay was because of the precautionary measures against the virus, so we asked due to it being prepaid what happens now , they said they will be able to pick us up in 2 hours. We made a big fuss however at this point it seemed pointless. At this point I was just in agony, so I then went to Valerie to try and book a new transfer however she said she only assists first and business class passengers making new transfers, I tried explain however she just cut me off and reminded me that she could only assist first and business class passengers. I was fumed at this point. We went on to chat to the very friendly staff (THANK YOU TO THE FRIENDLY STAFF AND FOR CHARGING MY PHONE;)) just talks about how frustrated we were and what we could do and the virus . After some chatting Valarie now stepped in and offered to assist , as she tried assisting us with a chauffeur drive , the third party company called back saying that they could come and fetch us. SO A BIG THANK YOU TO VALERIE at Emirates Dubai airport terminal 3:). 
I just feel even though it‚Äôs a third party company providing services, it‚Äôs still under the Emirates brand and can do damage. 
However it did not end there. 
On the flight back Home to Johannesburg , when collecting our luggage we found all our bags were broken into. Our luggage was searched and the valuables were stolen , a variety of things from perfume , sneakers , gold jewelry, AirPods, smart watch and many others. We proceeded to the Emirates desk in the Johannesburg Airport to find the staff sleeping at the desk , this guy did not even have his full uniform on and wow his willingness to assist was unenthusiastic . He was so rude and arrogant, I‚Äôm not sure if it was because it was early morning but when dealing with customers that is no excuse. He made us make open a case however when asking for a manager he would make all sorts of excuses, we asked to call the baggage claim to see if there was any cameras and he made another excuse about the phone he has at the desk cannot call baggage claim . His attitude didn‚Äôt not really help when we were so disgusted about what had happened , pure theft. The lady he called to come speak to us eventually didn‚Äôt even give us a chance to explain , all she said is it might have happened at the other airport. As a superior the way she handled the situation is absurd. Emirates should‚Äôve contacted us in a week of making the case however no one has.

We booked our flights in early Feb 2020 before the virus hit the world scene. Scheduled flight was September 18, 2020, the South African government have announced numerous times that international travel will not be allowed till first quarter of 2021. Their infection rate is out of control and they will impose a quarantine period of 21 days at a location of their choosing. 
So naturally we do not want to travel not even next year or even 2022, what do we do? Like everyone else we want a refund as we are not willing to travel not even at a later date.

First you try and find their phone number, that is a mission all by itself. The listed numbers have been disconnected. Eventually you find a working number then you wait online for at least an hour or longer.
When you are connected to an agent, you must deal with an agent that is riddled with PMS, anger issues cause they have to deal with dissatisfied customers all day long (you chose this line of work don‚Äôt take out your frustrations on us, the customer) and extremely rude. They are not even willing to try and assist. The bottom line is you get a BIG FAT F-You. So, trying to have a conversation with someone that will not let you speak you end up annoyed and screaming and they hang up.  The call center is in Toronto, Canada, very rude and un-cooperative.

Yes they gave us a free voucher return to Dubai so I thought I will continue on and have done despite never being wowed! No more.

I book all my trips online and my lates trip was a 7 week trip to Europe. Long haul with Emirates and short haul with easy jet. With covid obviously it has been hard for all airlines and that is understandable. The issue is Emirates no longer have any offices or numbers in Australia to call. So trying to find out the correct information, entitlements etc has been very hard. I have had 3 calls to call centres in India and 2 out of 3 times given incorrect information. Today the only way I found out what I wanted was to ask to speak to a supervisor as I knew what I was being told could not be correct.  I think it was lost in translation? On the other hand, my easy jet inter Europe flights no drama finding out and getting my full refund.  This is from a no frill airline......My daughter was joining us flying with Korean Air and she had a much easier time getting a refund and was offered hers straight up and way before Emirates even though her flight left 3 weeks after mine. Initially I was told I would pay a cancelation fee, then I still may pay a fee on the taxes and service charge though they could not tell me how much that would be until I cancelld. None of it true.

Until Emirates put offices back in Australia or provide staff who are trained correctly and can relay correct information I will no longer use them. My flights will be with Qantas, Singapore or even Korean Airlines in the future. Sad to watch a great airline go downhill.

In my experience, some have an off day and it could be a little unfair to judge them on one experience alone, also a company can only truly be judged when they are dealing with a customers problem, should one arise.
The first time I flew with this company I had heard how good they were, I wasn't impressed with the gadgetry, the cold bitter coffee or being neglected at meal time. 
The second time we booked our holiday with Emirates, we thought that a second chance is only fair, it could have been an off day. The flight was delayed to Dubai, which cost around 5 hours of our holiday, this delay meant that we missed the connecting flight that had left 3 hours before we eventually landed in Dubai, we eventually got to our destination late afternoon instead of the morning, losing a day of our holiday, I can't fault Emirates in how they dealt with us at Dubai, at Gatwick however, they were poor.
When I got back to the UK, as we loved the island so much I wanted to book again, I asked that they take our experience in to consideration and could we book again for this year at the same rate as 2019, not only did they point blank refuse, they offered some of, what I can only guess is their air miles equivalent, but if I didn't sign up and agree to that within 30 days, the offer was off. The nature of the reply was aloof and made clearer what my next move should be. I claimed my rightful compensation for the delay and loss of part of my holiday.

Emirates wrongfully denied boarding, arguing that I did not have the required transit visa in the United Kingdom. However it was Emirates' mistake and not true at all (transit visa was not required), subsequently I had to pay another ticket with another airline for the same route and the travel was smooth without any issue, and as expected, no transit visa was required in London. I requested a refund of the ticket from Emirates since they did not allow me to travel and I provided written proof I received straight from UK aviation authorities outlining the circumstances where airside transit is possible (= no immigration, no transit visa). Emirates Airlines refused to reimburse me and continued their previous position that transit was not possible, without providing any proof or supporting information, unlike what I did = provide proof. So bottom line they pretty much simply dismissed all information I provided and they hope the customer will go away empty-handed. I do not think they will pay anything unless threatened in court. This is a bad faith airline; I would not be surprised if some day they are hammered by a class action lawsuit for their behavior.

Emirates denied responsibility and said we had to work through Expedia; Expedia has so far taken 8 weeks to process our claim, saying they're waiting on Emirates for approval.

Pre-Boarding experience ‚Äì> Although it is understandable chauffeur services are not available due to COVID, however same queue at check-in for all passengers irrespective of class is not acceptable. Closing of lounge service due to COVID is fine, but no priority or separate area for boarding of First-class passenger is not. Being a First Class passenger, sure one would like to stand out from crowd especially during COIVD time if not for privacy.

In Flight service ‚Äì The inflight option in first class remains at same level as pre-covid time with minor exceptions which still is above par, however it was very disappointing to experience rude, impolite and zero courtesy service from some cabin crew which I have never experienced before especially in First class. Maybe disgruntled employees due to salary cuts, or I don‚Äôt know, can‚Äôt figure out the reason for it. Another very upsetting experience was no priority disembarking of passengers, while half the flight was empty and already heading to immigration queue, First-class passengers were informed later the door behind them was open disembarkation.

Stranded in New Zealand, 12000 miles from home with no flight back to the UK turned into a bit of a nightmare.  However we did get back some 3 weeks later than intended, no thanks to Emirates.  We paid ¬£3000 to Qatar Airways for our two economy one-way tickets and are still seeking reimbursement via our travel insurers.  Emirates were paid for our return journey which they never provided, they have not offered anything by way of a refund or compensation and have left it to others to pick up the pieces.  It's not a good way of encouraging future business in my view.  They still haven't re-instated flights from New Zealand almost 2 months later.    

As for the flights they did provide.  Our outbound ones - Glasgow to Dubai, Dubai to Melbourne and after a few days layover, Melbourne to Auckland were unsurprising if we discount the severe turbulence we experienced during the first leg of the journey.  There was definitely a need for seat belts to be fastened as we bounced along and had we been offered a stiff drink later it may have helped to calm the nerves - we weren't offered one of course.  When I checked the flight locator out of curiosity I was surprised to see that Kirkuk was mentioned.  I confess that it didn't ease my mind to discover we were flying over Iraqi airspace at the time of the incident!

We were fortunate to have been able to preselect a two seat row set-up for the first leg which was welcome however the seats in general provided good legroom and were fairly comfortable for both of the long haul flights. The third leg was operated by Qantas and not covered in this review. 

The entertainment system was good with plenty of movies and music to select which helped pass the time.

There was a choice of a couple of mains dishes at mealtimes (aside from those with dietary requirements) and by way of example this consisted of Chicken Biryani or Braised Beef on one of the flights.  We found them better than expected however our expectations of meals on flights are not high.  They also served an appetiser and a dessert neither of which was more than just """"edible"""".

Just got to know that I can so thought of sharing the experience. I have no doubt that the Air Line has first class services in all angle. But I am sure it's for long flights not for short flights. The weather was not good especially on the way back and the funny thing was the requested food was not available. As per the cabin manager (a Pakistani lady) food is subject to availability. Then we refused to eat so later she came and told that as a courtesy she will give us the cabin crew's food as they can survive without food. We still refused. I felt it offensive especially seeing that we were not feeling well due to the turbulence and weather. Furthermore, It was not expected from THE EMIRATES AIRLINES. If you are flying such a huge flight with so many passengers, the normal non-veg option should be available to accommodate all or max. It giving me and my wife a lecture of colleagues food was not required. Anyway I have heard lot of good things about the airline. But this was my first and probably the last experience.

Other customers had to rely on their governments' rescue flights two weeks later.
Due to my extra flight booking, additional hotel stays, visa fees etc., I incurred considerable costs that I would like to have reimbursed from Emirates. Emirates refuses to refund and claims that the return flight is not subject to EU law. Emirates didn't even think it necessary to express their regret to the thousands of stranded people. I will hire a lawyer and get money back through the courts.

0.394560724496841,4.47933387756348,"Emirates Flight Delays",1,"Let me start off by saying you‚Äôre the worst airline I have ever flown with in my entire life and
the fact I have flown with many different airlines across the world, you happen to be the one I
will never fly with again.
So where did it all go wrong.. Firstly I booked a last minute flight to Dubai with you which
was a very good price for the two of us, when I logged in I wanted to select my seats and
check in however it stated I had to do this on arrival at check in, I found this rather odd as I
personally work for an airline and that‚Äôs not how we go about doing things. I spoke to one of
your chat advisors online to try to understand why this was not possible, I did ask if the flight
was oversold as that could be why however my question was completely blanked and I was
told to turn up at the airport the next day so I did just that.
On the 17th August the next day I received an email from Emirates (included below) stating
that the flight was delayed to exactly 23:59 which was just about two hours more than usual,
loved how the sorry was in a smaller size print and not the same (bear that in mind as that‚Äôs
the only apology I ever got).
When we were picked up we drove to Terminal Three at London Heathrow, along the way I
was checking the flight time since it had changed a few hours ago, to my surprise the flight
now showed as delayed by 12 hours and 45 minutes which I just couldn‚Äôt believe so I called
your Headquarters on the way to Heathrow which took 13 minutes who told me the flight had
been cancelled and that there was nothing they could do over the phone‚Ä¶.. Helpful
customer service ‚Ä¶. I was told to proceed to the airport to speak to the Check In staff who
will be able to advise me of my options, this was not brilliant as my Father who was driving
us had to park up in short stay which has cost him ¬£12 to make sure my Mother and I were
going to get on a flight safely as after all you were doing nothing to help.
This is where it got worse, we arrived at Check In to find so many queues (obviously when
an Airbus A380 - 800 is cancelled you‚Äôd think you‚Äôd get more staff and pay overtime). We
waited in the line for 30 minutes until another member of staff said ‚ÄúAnyone on the delayed
Emirates flight EK006 please come to me‚Äù So we moved out of our place in the queue and
was answered by this rude staff member that said ‚Äúwould you like a hotel stay for tonight‚Äù
and we said we would rather get on a plane tonight but that wasn‚Äôt an option and he wasn‚Äôt
listening to anything we were saying to him so much so he decided to ignore us and told us
he can only help with booking a hotel for the night. We politely reminded him that he asked
anyone on that flight to come to him but he denied knowledge of that and told us to queue
again. Absolutely ridiculous and no apology either‚Ä¶.

We thought if we stood any chance getting on another plane (there was another Emirates
Flight at 20:50 which was showing as available online). So we proceeded to the Business
Class Check In who were sitting there doing nothing when there were lots of customers
upset, confused and angry. When we got to the man at Check in he said there‚Äôs nothing that
he can do and that there are no flights available to re - book us on and also told us the flight
was overbooked anyway, opps shouldn‚Äôt have said that... I showed the check in agent my
phone and the bookable flight, he came back and explained it may be possible but I need to
line up again with ticket changes, another hour passes and we finally get to the ticketing
desk who explain that wasn‚Äôt an option and I don‚Äôt know why you were told this and that the
hotel overnight was our only option, we really didn‚Äôt want to take this as we are only in Dubai
for 3 days so to shorten it to two days because of the arrival of the flight was really upsetting.
After speaking with the only manager on duty, she really didn‚Äôt know what was going on and
where the flight was or what was happening which just made everything more stressful.
Eventually we just decided to take the coach as no one at Emirates Headquarters,
management or ground staff were prepared to do what's right by the customer.
When we got to the Coach stand, there was only one coach at the time and they arrived
every 15 minutes so we were standing there for 45 minutes waiting to get to the hotel.
The next day on the 18th August was even worse, on the letter given by the Emirates ground
staff (no apology either and attached below) it said the coach will be there at 07:30 to pick us
up and take us to the airport, we got outside early at 07:20 to see a half full coach if that and
the driver saying there‚Äôs no more room for luggage and drove off leaving us stranded until
the next bus at around 07:45 - 07:50 and by then quite a few passengers affected were
waiting to board. All worried we wouldn‚Äôt make the flight, a few didn‚Äôt get on so I prayed that
they made that flight due to the neglect you‚Äôve shown.
When we arrived at Check in the queues were massive so much so there was a separate
line for Economy to check in which took 50 minutes to get through all while the Business and
first class staff could be assisting and getting people to check in rather than just sitting there.
We were so scared we would never make the flight because of this. Finally got through
security and monitored the boards constantly as we had about 5 minutes before the gate
would show‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ 15 minutes later the board never showed and we were getting worried, so
were other passengers that had no idea what was going on, we decided to turn up to the
Airline Service Desks inside the terminal and surprise surprise no one was at the Emirates
Desk, we all got so fed up we proceeded to the Emirates Business / First class lounge where
there was only one representative using her mobile phone in front of us all to find where
you‚Äôve decided to park the aircraft..

All legs were on the A380.  The first leg from BHX to Dubai was ok, the 6.5hrs went quite fast.  Nice meal and a pre landing snack were handed out.  The leg from Dubai to Melbourne was somewhat different.  Approximately 30 minutes after take off the cabin crew pulled the window  blinds down on each window seat.  These were not lifted until around 30 minutes prior to landing.  We were told that we could not open these blinds due to other passengers sleeping, despite each amenity pack consisting of eye shades.  We paid extra to select our seats and for my daughter to look out the window.  Unfortunately the dark cabin created a claustrophobic environment in some ways.  No natural light entering the cabin was like sitting in a box room with no windows.  Other passengers around us were discussing this issue too.  The return leg from Melbourne to Dubai was exactly the same, no window blinds could be opened.  A couple of the cabin crew were rude to a few passengers which raised a few eyebrows.  Emirates has a brilliant name amongst those who travel on their planes.  I can't dispute this on the shorter journeys, but when the seriously long hours are put in, i'd say different.  I guess their reputation is built on flying Business and first class.  We enquired at Flight centre Melbourne wether  blacking out the cabin was a common practice amongst airlines who carry out long haul journeys.  The response was 'she'd never known it happen'.

Underwhelmed by facilities, very limited soft drink selection and nothing special at all I do not know how much Emirates pay to use this lounge but it is not very good..

Thus, I‚Äôve decided to fly from Malaysia to London with Emirates with my travelling buddy. Besides, the plane tickets to London were cheaper ex Dubai in comparison to Malaysia Airlines‚Äô direct flight to London.

We sat beside each other. She had the window seat while I had the aisle. The leg room for Economy Class wasn‚Äôt really wide as advertised. However, whatever they lack in space, they made it up with the food portion on board & the long list of in-flight entertainment. 

My travelling buddy & I felt that we were being constantly fed. Frankly speaking, the menu looked good. Unfortunately, when it came to the acid test, I felt it was just average which came as a disappointment. The only thing best I liked was the dessert. They always serve the best desserts! Unfortunately not for the appetizers or mains. 

We transited in Dubai for 3 hours before our next flight. We both had the aisle seat then. Since I felt sleepy, I slept half way throughout the journey while my friend had a movie marathon in the air. I was awakened by her laughter & the bumpy ride from the beginning til the end.

We had also taken Emirates for our flight back to Malaysia. Transited in Dubai for the same number of hours before our next flight to Kuala Lumpur. The last carrier was bigger & you have to climb a few steps to go up the lavatory. That was something else! Unfortunately, it wasn‚Äôt as clean. There were no paper cups in the lavatory & the plane wasn‚Äôt as clean as the previous ones.   

Also, one crew member made a big boo-boo. He was careless while serving the passenger seated next to me in the middle. As a result, the glass juice had toppled over & she had wet her entire pants & seat. I was also not spared & had to wash my pants in the lavatory. We were only given some paper towels to clean ourselves. There were no spare blankets for our use. Thus, we had to sit on our damp seats.

With the above incident, I would probably ditch Emirates in future unless I have no choice. Asking for forgiveness is 1 matter, not having additional blankets for mishaps is another. There is no backup or contingencies for such incidents."

You have a private room with anything you could think of already there including a cooler with drinks.  The style is typical UAE with gold everywhere, not subdued at all.  The service in the air was phenomenal.  I also had a hot shower and visited the onboard lounge/bar.

The ground service was lacking.  After my Emirates driver dropped me off at the First Class check-in, I went to the large but nearly empty check-in and was not greeted or spoken to or smiled at - she just took my ticket from my hand and asked for my passport.  She handed it back and told me the gate number. and walked away.  I had no idea where to go but I deduced the general direction and found security, then on to the lounge where I got the same heartless welcome.  This zombie service continued in the lounge.  Perhaps everyone was in mourning?  Despite the personalities of the staff, the facilities were nice as was the food and drink.  Note that no one was rude or mean, just bland.

Went to airport after hearing rumours from other tourists, to find a notice pinned to a wall outside their office stating all Emirates flights would be grounded on 25th. Asked Emirates rep if any arrangements were made for our safe return home and were told that we would have to buy a ticket for a flight to Dubai immediately before they would discuss onward connections. Eventually she admitted that there would be no connection flight from Dubai. We made alternative arrangements with Malasian Airlines (excellent) based on this information. We only received an email from Emirates 12 hours before our scheduled flight officially cancelling the 28th flight.
They were still selling flights up to 31st on web sites.
They are now telling customers that paid them in advance that they will only issue vouchers for the unused segment of the cancelled flight, so we can have the """" pleasure"""" of their company and hospitality in future.
For a airline that is state owned by a country that will insist that you settle all debts before you leave their country or face incarnation I find this reprehensible.

Now this is the time and the opportunity to stand up and out as a company to show excellent customer service. That definitely did not happen with EMIRATES!
When applying for a refund of my ticket I was told, that my ticket didn‚Äôt allow a refund only a voucher! I was aware, that if I had decided to cancel my flight MYSELF I would not receive a refund.

I pay the full amount up front.
Then a few days before delivery I‚Äôm being made aware that the company has stopped the delivery of cars for an unknown period of time.
As I urgently need my car to get to work I want my money back to buy a new car at another company.
Then I‚Äôm told that due to ‚Äúcompany policy‚Äù I can‚Äôt get my money back. But they will give me a voucher to buy a car when they start delivering again.
DOES THAT GET ME TO WORK AS URGENTLY NEEDED? NO IT DOESN‚ÄôT!

This should teach other passengers that they should fly with Air lines who take responsibility for their passengers.,   The most disgusting and irresponsible way things  are done by Emirates ,stranding passengers in a country and absconding their responsibilities, only to look after their finances , is not the behaviour of a big Air Line.
Well Done Sri Lankan Air lines and Quatar , they  look after the welfare of their passengers as a priority. Now having paid money to Emirates we have to pay double to fly by Sri Lanka air lines. Emirates should learn to give priority of the passengers they fly ,not only in good times ,but  also in the event  of unexpected situations as well."

Since India imposed travel bans, one of my flight got cancelled. I received an email stating to call a number for refund and other updates. I am trying to call them for the past two days until my day of flight departure(23rd March) with no response from their customer care. I was clueless if I will get a refund or what should I do now? It had statement to visit local emirates office and listed Boston airport as one. Unsure what to do further, among this COVID panicking, I visited terminal E of Boston airport and visited customer service in person who were irresponsible and had no answers to my queries. Again, I called them and stayed in phone line for almost more than 1.5 hrs where call would itself get cancelled after waiting so long hours. They have not even cared to call back! So frustrating. Though I am not interested to raise request for a travel voucher and did not want to travel again with them, I have raised that request (only option that was available) as I was not sure how many refund will be given to me (despite the flight being cancelled). Everybody is held with some worse situations at this point and I understand if you do not answer prior to 48 hours of my departure. Amidst the travel plan within 10 hours or less, if you don't give a proper update, do you think this is reasonable? So upset and stressed since I had planned this trip with you. Charging extra at this situations or not being responsible for people loss even if there is no fault with individuals cannot be accepted. I think if you cancel the flight, you should take ownership and refund the amount to passengers without any further processes and questions. When I asked your customer service (in person at Boston airport on 22nd Mar around 8-9pm EST), the answers were shocking. The man literally told me to question to Indian Embassy for cancelling the flight and emirates is not responsible to refund unless we call their customer service to make such requests. Why do you make such statements if you will not attend the call? What do you think customers should do?"

First, there was an upgrade offered Dubai-Munich to Business Class (‚Ç¨490.-) what we've been trying to book. Then, the same as on the other flights on our trip before, this did not work at all. Not sure if this is a Service or just to entertain the passengers. We tried to book it at any station (Telefone, Checkin-/Transit-Desk) with a very unprofessional service staff. Last we've been told: """"I know it's not working but now, you can book for $1000 if you really want"""". I've told the Lady at the Transfer Desk that this all is unacceptable.

Second of three flights before arriving in Melbourne later in the week ‚Äì we‚Äôd completed the first ex-LGW covering the 5,500 km to Dubai overnight; leaving the UK at 22.10 h and arriving Dubai 09.00 (UK time 05.00 h) ‚Ä¶ tired, of course, given the lack of sleep. We figured to ‚Äòstretch out‚Äô (a cautious term in Economy) during the seven hours or thereabouts for the 5,480 km flight to Singapore ‚Äì with the city state 4 h ahead of Dubai. Things tended to work out as planned too.
First, we had to make that flight; we had 90 minutes in hand, which is OK when things are in your favour, notwithstanding the long travel distances required of the terminal. Dubai International Airport is ‚ÄòBig Country‚Äô if you‚Äôre not familiar with the place. Dubai‚Äôs Terminal 3 is the second largest building in the world (so we subsequently found out) at 1.7Mm3, with floor space containing three concourses: A, B & C. We‚Äôd arrived at a gate in C and had to make our way to gate A13 ‚Ä¶ the information board said ‚Ä¶ meaning long walks (on/off moving walkways), escalators and lifts. Fortunately, the place was well signposted, but you had to keep moving and remain aware.
We had 15 minutes seated outside the gate before being channelled in through the security screen that separates you from inside seating. This is you and your 500+ fellow travellers queued and shuffling through the security people/equipment ‚Ä¶ which is where the first hurdle cropped up. I‚Äôd arrived with loss of hearing ‚Äì air pressure changes and ear deposits (you‚Äôll know the issue) ‚Äì and couldn‚Äôt easily follow the instructions that were being shouted to the shuffling masses.
Not that this is rocket science ‚Äì it‚Äôs pretty familiar territory; hand luggage on moving x-ray feed, pockets empty, belt removed and still the detector gate buzzed me (much to the annoyance of the security guard ‚Äì who had let his training slip after what may have been a long shift ‚Äì here‚Äôs one more insignificant/dumb/tired traveller slowing things down). My fault, of course, there was a pair of glasses in a top pocket ‚Ä¶ I was made to return and put my glasses on the x-ray feed. Power issues.
After that ‚Ä¶ the flight was pretty ‚Äòmuch of a muchness‚Äô (as they say). The A380-800 is a great aircraft (ours was registered A6-EUF) ‚Äì this thing about space, quietness, comfort, service/facilities. We‚Äôve said all this before, but you can‚Äôt compare the sense of isolation/separation that comes from flying in an airframe this large ‚Äì as if you‚Äôre not flying at all but sleeping, escaped into a movie, eating a meal or simply lazing (notwithstanding the relatively small space in which you‚Äôre doing these things). All those people around you, but. you can easily get up and move around ‚Äì to stand at the back or walk circuits if the mood takes you.
It helps to be small/medium in statue ‚Äì stretching out, curled up, entering/leaving the seat. Better still, it helps to have an empty seat next to you ‚Ä¶ we did ‚Äì place in which to dump all that extraneous ‚Äòstuff‚Äô (us and the man in the seat on the other side next to the aisle); four seats across the centre of the rear cabin ‚Äì row #85. Oh, and the adjustment mechanism on 85F was really stiff (should, of course, be fixed by now).
And then they feed you. There was a sandwich just after take-off; choice of chicken pastrami/chutney or gruyere/chilli/tomato; breakfast time for our travel schedule, but the panini was challenging/unattractive - hard bread, stodgy filling; it remained uneaten; coffee was welcome. Two-thirds of the way into the flight lunch was served; choice of roast chicken or fish. Chose the chicken/vegetables (and then wished had chosen the fish/noodles). Vegetables were fine; slab of chicken looked plastic-like/tasted bland and, again, remained largely uneaten. Selection of wines, beer, soft drinks, juices gratis. Menu suggested glass/200ml of Brut for US$20 (as a ‚Äòlittle extra‚Äô). Dolce offered apple/mousse/crumble - OK.
Services during mealtimes were good, efficient, distant - all those mouths to be fed/watered quickly. What can you expect/what more do you need from a seven-hour flight?
For all that it was a sleep flight ‚Äì daylight, sure, but you can wear your eye-patches and cover your head with the blanket ‚Äì but then there‚Äôs the challenge of the classic Emirates ICE entertainment system a finger touch away on the rear of the seat in front of you ‚Äì all those channels/movies/features; mine were an insipid ‚ÄòTokien‚Äô movie followed by a more entertaining/thoughtful ‚ÄòRed Joan‚Äô, but then the latter had been anchored by Judi Dench.
Summary? Smooth ‚Äòpar for the course‚Äô flight with the security of well-known systems around you. No turbulence. Quiet cabin with the muffled drone of the engines in the background. Mixed quality foods. Good value AtoB transport. Single word findings ‚ÄòGood‚Äô ‚Ä¶ except that TripAdvisor doesn‚Äôt do ‚Äògood‚Äô. Then we‚Äôll stretch things a bit to ‚ÄòVery Good‚Äô (it was better than ‚Äòaverage‚Äô)

6.26236867904663,10.107572555542,"Airplane Flight Services",4,"Italy and the UK behind us for the summer and we were due into Melbourne in 10 days time ‚Äì scheduling flights and a week in Singapore to enjoy this most hospitable of East Asian destinations. We had an Airbus A380 waiting for us at the end of the airbridge with all the space, comfort, quietness and familiarity that comes from targeting this particular aircraft when the opportunity arises.
There are no two-seat combinations in Economy, so we‚Äôd chosen a couple of seats at the rear of the end cabin #87F & #87G; aisle and one insider in the centre. Given the opportunity we‚Äôd normally take a seat/window, but not if it meant having to request the third passenger in the line of seats for access to the aisle. A window typically provides escape into the sky around you and, occasionally, something to see below but when there‚Äôs Emirate‚Äôs back-of-the-seat ICE entertainment system available it‚Äôs easy to escape those flying hours in the movies, documentaries, sports, news reports and more available. ICE is, in reality, quite spectacular as an example of how in-flight entertainment has shifted from the book/magazines that you once carried, to the cabin pull-down movie screen, to those personal ‚Äòyou choose‚Äô options. Look back over the years and smile in amazement.
It‚Äôs about 5,500 km flying distance from London to Dubai. Flight EK010 left 22.10 h around 25 minutes late and landed 6-7 hours later sometime before 5.00 h UK time. Dubai is typically four hours ahead of London. Flying time in which to get your head down? Sure, in theory, but we‚Äôd dinner available once airborne and, crucially, a second flight pending Dubai to Singapore with short connecting time. It was more practical to sleep on the second flight (if this worked out).
Sit at the back of the A380 cabin and there‚Äôs this feel of spaciousness in front of you. Sit on the other side of the aircraft and you‚Äôve the stairs to the upper deck to provide that additional sense of space. Behind us on this side were the toilets. When you‚Äôre in the back row there‚Äôs no one behind you ‚Äì no one using your seat headrest to pull themselves up. Seats were comfortable if small ‚Äì goodness knows how heavier/larger travellers handle things. This flight too, we had the advantage of an empty adjacent seat. This is where you pile all those additional items ‚Äì pillows, blanket, clothes, papers, books, etc; you and the passenger on the other aisle seat both. You can also stretch your legs/feet into the empty seat space.
So, things had gone well with the flight ‚Ä¶ well, sort of ‚Ä¶ We‚Äôd had a couple hiccups at LGW‚Äôs North Terminal. Large and empty that time of night - spacious with lots of lights. There was nowhere to weigh luggage/checking things w/o feeding coins into a machine; people were using the out-of-use Virgin Upper Class check-in counters - we did the same. The woman at Check-in provided a gate number but said to wait for overhead screen confirmation. Once through security we sat/stood around reading/waiting the ‚Äògate available at 20.45‚Äô to change. We‚Äôd been told earlier that this was the boarding time. Then lots of long-distance walking once the gate number appeared ‚Äì us and several hundred others.
Boarding was smooth ‚Äì by seat/loading zones; first of the Economy passengers in zone C. The cabin was COLD (and remained so well into the flight) ‚Ä¶ but got better with more clothes and blankets. Dinner was served ‚Äì choice of beef/roast potatoes or chicken/rice/veggies ‚Äì both good; the dolce - apple & blackberry compote with topping - looked tired/tacky by comparison. We dabbled, tasted and left it. The drinks trolly preceded dinner and then came around a second time ‚Äì but missed our row. Coffee/tea was not served. Did we miss that too?
Cabin staff were attentive, if distant. The cabin and toilets were clean. Interesting to see how small the toilet has become on modern aircraft ‚Äì difficult to turn round, and this one had a miniscule wash basin - one where it was impossible to get your face close to the bowl/tap to cup water and splash your face. Imagine. And the sink in this particular toilet didn‚Äôt drain.
How to remember this flight? It has to be from watching John Huston‚Äôs movie based upon the Rudyard Kipling story: ‚ÄòThe man who would be king‚Äô. It featured Michael Caine and Sean Connery - swashbuckling adventure set in Central Asia ‚Äì with the lead actors working well one-to-the-other. It was made ‚Ä¶ wait for it ‚Ä¶ 45 years ago but remains timeless in the sense that entertaining stories of this kind will always be a pleasure. Two key actors in their prime ‚Äì imaginative escapism for couple hours overflying Eastern Europe and the Black Sea at night.

On arrival luggage was quickly available and car waiting for transfer to hotel. On the way back took advantage of a stopover in Dubai with free car to and fom hotel - which was very good. Emirates does not accept luggage transfer from all other airlines so be carefull if you have a connecting flight.

The timings of the flights are ideal (outbound, leaving PER around 10:30 pm and arriving in MUC at roughly 1 pm, with a roughly 3 hour stopover in Dubai).
At the moment, all flights are on an Airbus A380, which has two benefits as compared to the Boing 777: for Economy rather generous legroom (I am 188 cm tall, and don't struggle to stretch my legs under the seat in front), and the aircraft is really quiet - especially if you get a seat in front of or over the wings.

Food is usually quite tasty, though nothing to rave about. Service varies from adequate to good, depending on the crew. It's never bad, though."

So when I had to cut costs on a recent cruise holiday I decided to fly economy home from Dubai and just fly business on the longer, outward leg to Singapore.  The difference was beyond belief, the Emirates economy service is dreadful.  No drinks service before dinner.  You get wine OR another drink WITH dinner and that‚Äôs your lot. My husband had the temerity to go and ask for two G&T‚Äôs later in the flight.  They were practically thrown at us!  How dare we disturb resting cabin crew!  I hadn‚Äôt realised that economy meant that cabin crew were economical with their working time,  
The seats are cramped and if you sit next to someone who believes the tiny amount of space can be improved by encroaching on yours then you end up playing a battle of Innes throughout the flight. I had this experience and it‚Äôs not bad enough to complain but it‚Äôs a total pain.  Irritating is the best description.  
Nothing was what I‚Äôd expected from Emirates.  Not the cabin crew, not the food, not the drinks, not the seat, not the add ons like headsets etc.  It did actually make Ryanair cabins look quite luxurious.  
The moral of the story is if you‚Äôre flying Emirates go business or first but the airline appear to really believe that anything lower is for cattle.  Emirates provide the epitome of ‚Äúcattle class‚Äù."

We arrived at Dehli more than two hours before boarding. Luggage checked in, we were directed to the wheelchair assistance waiting area.  No help came.  We found a telephone number on the wall of an empty office .  We called and it was answered in Dubai.  Almost out of time to get to the boarding gate, one wheelchair arrived. My complaint is that the chronic delay in Emirates‚Äô wheelchair assistance arriving and no chair for me, then being made to rush to the plane which caused heat stroke.   If the airline staff had waited just a few minutes I would have fully recovered.   I should never have been ordered off the plane.  I should never have been put through all this nonsense of having to go to the hospital with all my luggage.   The final insult was to be told that a travel agent could book seats on the Sunday 1035 flight which I would have to pay, but Emirates could not. No alternative flights were mentioned.  We were left to do all this ourselves.  Having to pay for my flight twice is really quite objectionable. We had to find overnight accommodation ourselves which added to our costs along with taxi fares and hospital fees and calls to the UK.  Our out of pocket expenses amount to ¬£1670.33. A complaint was lodged with Emirates on March 3 but so far has been ignored.  Looking on various websites it appears their 'complaints' procedure is an un-manned email address aka a 'black hole'."

Yes, we could pay for premium seats, something new in the Emirates portfolio of charges but customer service used to be excellent on Emirates whereas now it looks as if they're trying to emulate the budget airlines. Whilst the ICE entertainment package is still excellent, in January we flew 6 sectors with Emirates and the film choice never changed once! The food was pretty ordinary too - where were those top quality serves we used to enjoy - and the chocolates have disappeared too! Once you factor in that the Skywards loyalty programme is no longer as rewarding as it used to be then choosing Emirates is no longer a given. Too few miles offered and far too many needed to get any rewards. I'd have to fly something like 40 sectors to get one upgrade - it never used to be like this.

The agent at the airport said we‚Äôll write a damage report and you can get replacement luggage at Evex Mississauga, since I am frequent traveller I asked for replacement. When we went to Evex the general Manager there said the value written by the airport agent for the suitcases was 25% of the actual price. We were told that since we did not have a receipt, only50% of the value will be given. Now, the value of the luggage was $400 each the 50% would is $200 each as per Evex. He told us to get this corrected by emirates and come back as he had a new suitcase of same value on sale for $160 each, which we are happy to get. Now emirates refuses to update the information, their is no manager ever that takes our call. Different people keep calling us and telling us to email them all kinds of paperwork but at the end they said they will give us $90 for both suitcases. One person emailed us from us hotmail account and then called us and asked for a copy of passport too ‚Äúwhy from a hotmail account‚Äù. So we are still waiting for a manger they have if they have to call us back and update the value or send me 2 large suitcases as I checked in 2 large suitcases at the Delhi airport but got 2 damaged never to be used again suitcases in Toronto with no one willing to take responsibility for their actions.

I am writing this review to give some good feedback in regards our flight. Me and my partner flew out on our holidays on the 26th February 2020, flight Gatwick to Dubai. We were very excited as it was our first time travelling to Thailand and first time flying with Emirates so we were looking forward for the on plane experience! Let me tell you, it did not disappoint! Was the best experiance ever on a plane! On that particular day we were lucky Jessica Oliveira was one of the flight attendants on board, she went above and beyond for us, making sure our experiance would be the best! She was very attentive with our needs, gave us good tips for our trip, allowed my partner to take a picture with the iconic Emirates hat (which was really nice!) and she even went as far as getting a card signed by all crew members on the plane, in therir native language, wishing us a good trip! Amazing... she truly made the start of our holidays! 
Jessica is the perfect example of outstanding customer service, and we will definitely fly again with Emirates!
The plane facilities are good, seats comfortable, entertainment is good, all in all top quality airline, but what makes the difference between choosing Emirates and other top quality airlines, for us, will definitely be the human touch and the amazing experiance we had!

Kindest regards!"

Adelaide Dubai:
Travelling as a family we had four seats together in the economy section. Unfortunately, as we were one of the last on the plane somebody had mistakenly sat in my children's seat. When my kids asked the stewardess to move them, she was rude and unhelpful causing my kids a fair degree of angst (She wanted my kids to move rather than the people sitting in their seats). My entertainment system did not work, which sucks for a 13+ hour flight. There was a row of empty seats behind ours and I asked if I could move one back, the same bursar that was rude to my kids said that the row had to be kept free because of weight balancing in the aircraft (I fly a lot and I understand that on some small planes sometimes you need to adjust passenger layout for balancing, but never in the middle row of a full plane of this size). During the flight however this row was given to parents with children that could not be calmed in their seats. I feel for the parents of screaming kids on long haul flights and I have experienced the same with my own kids when younger, but this meant that there were now at least two areas in the plane with screaming kids and obviously the balancing of the plane was not that important. The food was ordinary and despite being relatively close to the front of the plane, they were already out of choices for meals.

This flight was awesome. The personnel were helpful and friendly, the equipment modern and the food and beverages plentiful. This is the type of service that I come to expect from an airline on long haul flights."

Seats were fine as expected for economy, food menus going out and coming back were the same, the beef dish was fine the curry dish was awful, rest of it was ok! It took them over 1 and a half hours before they came with food and there was NO drinks service before that, we were offered an alcoholic drink with the meal. Tea and coffee was served after that, my husband requested wine, the response was not serving alcohol on this service!! He had to ask another twice before they reluctantly gave him another!! Likewise on our return trip we just got one alcoholic drink in almost 8 hours. The entertainment package was good.

The only downside of this trip was that we had to leave out of Dublin instead of Shannon Airport which is literally 12 miles down the road from us instead 3 hours to the other side of the country.  With that said we arrived into Dublin to check in and from that point forward it was an incredible experience.   We had purchased two seats instead of being stuck in a 3 seat row or 4 seat row and it made a huge difference at least for me.  A bit more legroom and no one climbing over you to get out. I am 5'10 and while that's not overly tall the legroom was pretty darn good.   I highly recommend it.   Overall the trip over and back was incredible.   The food...holy smokes...the food was amazing.  Airplane food is generally pretty horrific at the best of times and United is absolutely the worst but the food on Emirates was awesome and you get real silverware.  The service is fantastic and this is in Economy and you get some very good choices in menu selection.     Yes, you are on a plane for 16 hours (not including layover in Dubai) but you still come off the plane feeling pretty darn good.  On our return home to Ireland we splurged and we upgraded to Business Class.  Oh Yea...this is whole new world and if I could fly this way everytime I would. The service, the food, the comfort is out of this world.   It is the only way to go!   The attention to detail is world class and the plane (Boeing 777-300ER) is fantastic.   

If you are going to travel internationally then this should be your airline of choice if at all possible.   I know, I know..a plane is a plane is a plane but, what you do inside the plane makes all the difference in the world and Emirates have definitely found the secret recipe.   It is an amazing airline.  I want to give a big shout out to the crew on the Dubai to Dublin flight that looked after us on the way home.  Thank you!!!!!   You turned a great trip into a wonderful trip.

The seat is comfortable with a bed mode that comfortably accommodates taller travelers with no problem. It isn't as wide or comfortable as the fold down bed in the Singapore Air A380 suites, but the number of routes available have shrunken dramatically. The video screen is very large and HD with many entertainment options on the ICE system.  And there is still the shower, which is wonderful after a 16hr flight, leaving you refreshed on arrival.  The service is excellent and the food and wine list (unless you are flying to Saudi in which case there is no Alcohol on board) is up to the expectations.  The cabin was not full so the staff set up a vacant suite as a bed so I could sleep without having to wait or put away my stuff to convert the seat.

I had planned it so my elderly parents and Aunt who were flying out of Chicago, would arrive in Dubai around the same time as my flight.

Business class prices are ridiculous and often only partly full. They are really going to struggle in the coming few months I think.

The running of the aircraft by the crew was good. The worst flight of 16 hours from Dubai to Auckland was on a modern aircraft again but the service was the worst we have experienced for many years with a lack of meals and lots of mistakes.

We were only able to get economy seats. We chose to pay to pick our seats so we could be together. It seemed a bit expensive, I think about ¬£75 each one way. There were cheaper seat options. We were flying on an A380-800 Airbus Jet. My son said that was cool and must be some sort of compensation for having our cruise cut short!  Once we boarded and found our seats upstairs, in a small sectioned off compartment, I was happy. Plenty of leg room, a cupboard underneath the window for any extras to be stored. Nice screen on the back of the seat in front which I was able to easily navigate.Toilet area bigger than most others.

Admittedly this is an unusual event, but some people with young children and lots of luggage struggled to march the few hundred yards to the hotel.
I‚Äôve always thought the A380 a wonderful aircraft, but have obviously not experienced it full before. As you might imagine the alternative flight was full to the gunnels and was a little claustrophobic down the back end.

The terminal also had some not so nice busy toilets but also some very nice and modern empty toilets which were nice. I have never been to Dubai or the airport so I did not know what to expect, but every single restaurant, cafe and shop was extremely extremely expensive. When boarding, we had to get taken to the stand on a very long bus ride. The flight however was very good. Boarding the plane, this one was an older type compared to the one I had taken from Brussels to Dubai. It was the same aircraft type (Boeing 777-300ER), but the interior was different. The in-flight entertainment was the same as the first leg from Brussels but there was so much to choose from on the excellent IFE that it didn't matter. The food on this flight was also excellent like the last flight. The service however, was not as good. Compared to the excellent service on the first leg, it was a bit of a disappointment. At one point during the dinner service, they woke my sister up by tapping on her shoulder multiple times and asking her """"Madam, you want to eat?"""". They had also not given the amenity kits to everyone, but that didn't matter so much as we didn't need one and it was great anyway to get one in the first place as other airlines didn't do that. Once landed in Bali, the baggage claim was very a very tiring 30 mins especially at 11 pm. We were scared they wouldn't turn up but it seemed like everyone had been waiting for a very long time anyway. The rest was a tedious experience but that had nothing to do with the airline. Overall, the flight was a great flight but not as good as our last one and a bit let down by the service."

The check-in staff were also pretty friendly. After that and sitting around the airport, we got to the boarding gate. The boarding was pretty good without any complaints. Getting on the plane, I was impressed. I have only been on a few long-haul flights in the past, but this one was my first on Emirates. Sitting down, the seat was comfortable and accommodated with an impressively sized in-flight entertainment system (IFE). The cabin crew were being great for the moment. During the flight, I had not done much, but the entertainment system was incredible. With an amazing selection of different TV shows, films, and games, there was barely any boredom to be had. There was also some free Wi-Fi even for the economy passengers. You got 10 MB for free which is enough to maybe send a few messages, which is pretty generous when compared to other airlines. The service was pretty great during this flight. The seat was comfortable and the cabin was nice, with some very nice mood lighting and little stars on the ceiling. This flight was pretty flawless. There was also live TV channels and news on this IFE  + live cameras. This flight also had some great food compared to other flights in the past. Top notch. Landing in Dubai to then connect. The flight was pretty great. The rest was mostly the airport's fault, with an extremely long bus ride in the hottest temperatures to get to the Terminal. This was my best economy flight I have ever had, with a comfortable seat, a nice cabin, a fantastic IFE, and great service. This flight was completely flawless and top notch."

She hesitantly took the bottle from my hand and held it at the tip so she won‚Äôt get an infection from me‚Äôhahaaa!!!
I still thanked her for her bitter kindness and she looked at me with something that looks like hatred.
Anyway I didn‚Äôt care so I proceeded to my seat.
Fortunately or unfortunately this same girl was on the meal cart and there was no smile at all on her face,she talked rudely to others seated ahead of me who were elderly.

I didn‚Äôt enjoy my flight and I didn‚Äôt feel like ordering  even a single glass of extra drink besides the meal service.

6.57691192626953,2.40566611289978,"Airline Cabin Service",2,"This flight was onboard the large, double decked airbus. Thanks to a very under staffed Manchester Airport security suite we didn‚Äôt have to wait long in the gate before boarding.

Boarding commenced with our section of the plane so we were amongst the first to enter the boarding tunnel to the plane, where we ended up waiting a long time. Not many can have boarded before we came to a complete halt in the tunnel and were kept waiting. Not great as it was hot and a confined space.

The plane was clean and the flight itself was smooth. However the cabin crew seemed wholly disorganised. Nobody seemed to be coordinating or managing the teams. If was a 9pm flight and therefore we expected drinks and the main meal to be served quickly. Drinks never happened. Specially ordered meals were handed out quickly and the drink trolley was parked in the aisle from the galley within half an hour of taking off. The stewards never brought the drinks trolley around and drinks were not offered. By 11pm (2 hours or so into the flight) passengers were calling the steward for drinks. Our steward was then running up and down the aisle with 1 or 2 drinks at a time instead of completing a coordinated trolley service so everybody was served. By midnight she was telling passengers in response to drinks requests she needed to come to with the service, but then proceeded to take and deliver the order! Eventually meals were brought round, presumably passengers elsewhere on the plane had already been served as there was no choice on meals for our section of the plane. 1 passenger nearby was furious as he had an allergy and couldn‚Äôt eat the only option. He asked for crisps instead but they never materialised. To be fair to the crew, 2 stewards spoke with him and remained very pleasant and tried to assist him. 

What was particularly irritating is that stewards from other parts of the plane had kept coming down to our section requesting the meal option for their section in the plane (for the upper deck mainly in our case). That meant by the time our steward finally got round to serving our meals she had already given away our allocation of 1 of the meal choices. Where was the common sense or consideration for her section of the plane?

The food we did receive however was pleasant and a reasonable portion size.

The stewards handing out the children‚Äôs packs on both the out and inbound flights walked past my daughter without offering her one. I had to ask them for the packs and she was also never offered the children‚Äôs meal. I appreciate they might have not wanted to offer if they thought she might be older, but don‚Äôt they have passenger lists for their section of the plane and don‚Äôt they check them? 

The entertainment system was working though the Dubai Expo video you couldn‚Äôt avoid became really, really trying by the time we had competed several Emirates flights. Choice of films was pretty good and we all found something to watch for the duration.

The toilets were clean, although being around 7 rows away we did keep getting a very strong and rather unpleasant detergent smell.

Overall the fiasco in providing a drinks/meal service really marred the flight for us. I appreciate it was probably worse for us as it took over an hour to get through Manchester Airport security and the plan we had to eat at the airport pre-flight went out of the window, so we were already hungry when we got on board. That said, the airline was providing its main meal first and when departure was 9.15pm, it‚Äôs not acceptable to not serve that meal until after midnight. 

It was my first experience of flying with Emirates and I had expected much better. Of all the long haul providers I have flown with I have never seen such lack of management,  organisation and coordination."

On the flight back, via Dubia, we paid for extra legroom, and uite honestly, it's not worth the ¬£74 each. There's nowhere to put your bag, the movie screens are nearly as good, and the tray is an absolute so-and-so to get to if your neighbour hogs the arm rest, as the trays are hidden within.

On this flight however, the meal option I wanted on both the first flight and second flight ran out before food service came to my seat. I wasn't even that far back. It's a slight annoyance, as when one option runs out that fast, that means the other one is pretty unappealing to the masses. So yeah, got """"stuck"""" with the secondary option on two flights straight which honestly was pretty bad, but it's not the end of the world! First world problems.

As part of the package I was picked up at my home by a driver in a spotless vehicle, went speedilly through the check in  and security to the Emirates lounge where I indulged in a fabulous champagne breakfast. The in Flight experience was so good that, although I was in Australia for over a week, I immediately started looking forward to my return trip home. The only downside was when coming back through Dubai an airport worker gave me the wrong information as to where the departure gate was and I only made my connection by four minutes. With frayed nerves I took my seat only to be comforted by a lovely flight attendant with a glass of champagne before take off.
Food and drink were all excellent and one of the features of the plane is that it has a bar where you can mix with other passengers and enjoy free drinks. All in all a very pleasurable experience."

We could have gone to Heathrow (90min drive) and flown direct on BA or Air Mauritius, but with Stansted just 15mins from our house it was just so easy. Check in was a pleasure with staff who actually looked like they wanted to please you. Emirates fly from the west satellite (via the train) so much more civilised than the east satellite usually used by the likes of Ryanair. Here of course you get 30mins notice for your gate and then its a cavalry charge to actually get there. Over an hours notice with Emirates, very casual and easy.
The plane wasnt full so we could all spread out. At Dubai we were transferred to our onwards gate by coach and then onto a double-deck A380 to Mauritius. That flight was full but everything still worked well. The inflight system is amazing with a huge choice. Food was pretty good for an aircraft and the staff actually looked like they were enjoying their jobs. Take note other airlines....

The airport experience was good but I miss the Emirates lounge which they used to have before at Mumbai Airport as the current lounge is very much crowded and hardly have place to sit nor the current lounge had more options in their menu or in buffet. The flight was comfortable no doubt as it was A380. The flight attendants were prompt and were doing their work with full dedication. Also the inflight lounge had nice varieties of snacks. But the breakfast served in flight was not upto the mark as the omelette was very hard and other option had a lot of spice and I didn‚Äôt want to eat spicy stuff in the morning. Would recommend if you could have some more options. The take off and landing were very smooth and rest things were very good.

Yes, the delays were due to flooding, but to witness 1000's of people waiting in Dubai airport for 10+ hours without any information was unbelievable and totally chaotic.  At no point did any member of staff speak to stranded passengers in the queues to at least advise on what was happening either in person or via the PA.  Connections desks with only 1 or 2 members of staff to man them.  Passengers with very small children, elderly passengers and pregnant passengers not prioritised. Truly shocking experience.    Our situation was only resolved when we phoned family back in England who managed to re book our flights.  However, if we hadn't have had the Emirates app on our phones, we would never had been able to get the revised boarding passes from the Connections desk as that was the queue we had been in for 8 hours......

This meant more than 3 hours (we were herded into another waiting area prior to boarding) since we were last able to access any food or drink.

Booking online is quick and easy.

Boarding was smooth although a little disjointed. (Although this time flying economy, I'm not sure why the staff didn't allow the rewards members to board before economy class.).

Food on the plane was bland. There is a general decline in food quality and choice. Avoid the pastry snack and chocolate cake blocks they serve. 

Poor drink selection. All very sugary. No healthy drinks alternatives.

The plane seats are old, stained and uncomfortable. On the surface, the plane is clean, but when you look closer, (between seats, under the seats, on the floor, food tray, storage) is generally quite dirty (But this does seems to be a common problem with all flights)

Although having never flown it's major rival Qatar I have yet to make that comparison. The size of an A380 may feel roomier in economy no matter what airline you fly however I have always felt just that little bit more comfortable on an Emirates plane. Their secitioning off of parts of economy with curtains helps as does the softer lighting, the interior colour palette and toilets that are just that little bit bigger. Staff were available but not pushy. I had some broader issues with noisy children on my flight which can be very challenging (especially with sleeping) but that's not something that can be solved per se as the experience is likely just as tough for the parents. Kids on a flight is simply a matter of luck. My only criticim of Emirates remains it's tendnecy to under-serve alcohol. This may be to do with the UAE's obvious alcohol restrictions but I wised that the cabin crew did not remove alcohol from the 2nd drinks service. They literally took it off the trolley. I may not want 3 but I might like 2 drinks on board. A small thing on an otherwsie easy flight."

5.84463596343994,5.35352039337158,"Emirates Airline Hospitality",1,"I was of the perception that Qantas was a terrible airline when I flew with them about two years ago only to discover that Emirates is even a worse airline that should be given a negative rating.

I experienced the worst service all the way from the reservation staff (both in Melbourne and Dubai) to check in staff to ground staff to crew staff.

When I purchased the ticket, I had spoken to staff to add my membership number and meal preference of Vegetarian Jain Meal, both of which were entered into the system and received a written confirmation for the same.

One week prior to flying, I called the office in Australia to amend my dietary requirements to gluten free in addition to the vegetarian jain meal (VJML). After a lengthy discussion with the staff and explaining the importance of a gluten free diet due to a medical condition, I was advised that a special meal can be requested for a medical condition and a medical certificate to be produced during check in.

As I got to the airport and proceeded to the counter for check in, I was inquiring about my meal preference for which I was advised that there was no special meal on the system and that emirates attempted to contact the travel agent to advice the meal preference was not processed. I believe this is terrible for Emirates to use this as an excuse when in fact they had my contact details when I had made the initial contact to add the meal preference for which I was provided written confirmation. As the check in process continued, I was advised to speak with ground staff prior to boarding and also advised that I could purchase a meal and take it with me. The check in staff were fully aware that there were no cafes open at 4am in the morning for me to purchase something and yet they advised me to take something with me. I had also provided my medical certificate upon check-in as advised previously. If Emirates believed in providing excellent service, there would not have been inconsistencies. 

As I got to the gate when boarding had commenced, I spoke to the supervisor/team leader of ground staff as advised by check in staff. I was advised that a meal was on board for me which was not communicated to cabin staff. I was also advised that Emirates had stopped offering VJML for over a year. If this was the case why did I receive a written confirmation to say that my special meal VJML was what I was to receive. It feels like the staff do not know what they are doing.  I accepted the advise that a meal was on board for me and proceeded to board.

During the flight when meals were being served, the air hostess was like """"what meal would you like"""". I had replied saying that I had ordered a special meal and was advised by the ground staff that there was a meal for me. The head air hostess approached me to check whether I had changed seats or anything as there was someone with a VJML and we have distributed all the special meals so are you sure that you have not changed seats. There was no apology at all from the staff as they were too arrogant to acknowledge that there was a mistake. I was given a raw vegetarian meal for the entire duration of the flight of 14 hours where all meals that followed were raw salad. What frustrated me was all the lies that I had been told. If Emirates are providing a raw vegetarian meal when it has not been the meal choice for the entire duration of the flight, they may as well have their license to operate cancelled as they are money grabbing robbers that do not care about the customer service. The head air hostess had advised that they can continue giving fruit platters for the remainder of the service in addition to the raw meal which was not the case as only received fruit platters once for the meal. I was also advised by the head air hostess that I was given gluten free crackers which was obtained from business class and is not allowed. As if crackers is going to suffice for a full meal, obvious money grabbing thieves. If Emirates valued their customers, they would have apologized at the first instance and offered to upgrade to business class for the entire trips with Emirates inclusive of return flights. This is a clear example of how Emirates are money grabbing thieves that do not value their customers. The air hostess had approached me asking what meal can be requested for the onward flight to Nairobi where I suggested that a vegetarian jain meal that is gluten free is what I would like. I was advised that one is a religious diet and one is because of a medical condition so cannot have both. To me that suggested as an example if a customer requested a halal diet, Emirates response is like sorry we cannot provide a halal diet! Another example of how Emirates staff have no clue in what they are doing and absolutely do not value their customers.

As I got to Dubai, I spoke to reservation staff advising that if a special meal can be added for the return flights which was vegetarian jain meal that was gluten free. I was advised that I had to pay for a special meal. How much can the standards of Emirates stoop when they want to grab more money and take no responsibility at all!  Day light robbery at its highest! It is disappointing to have flown an airline where there standards are pathetic!"

The plus points are the bar on the A380 - it is good to stand or sit and chat to other passengers. The seats are comfortable but the ‚Äúsweetheart‚Äù seats ( 2 middle seats close together) don‚Äôt give you much elbow room and the divider doesn‚Äôt go all the way down which is annoying.

The bar on the plane is great, a lot of high class spirits, wines and cocktails. The stuff was very friendly everywhere. Will go again with them this year."

Good comfortable flat beds with additional mattress. International  range of quality food. Friendly service with a smile. Spacious business class lounges world wide. Luxurious complimentary car services. Good value"
4.60440397262573,7.83720302581787,"Emirates Air Travel",5,"My name is Robert and I live in Thailand. My mother lives in northern Italy and I fly there often to see her and my two sisters who also live near her. I have had experiences travelling this route on many airlines, and have come to the conclusion that this airline (Emirates) and this flight is the best for almost any price. The reasons are the departure time, the price, the great in-flight experience, and the availability of many different connection options.
However, it all starts with the aircraft, the Airbus 380, the most comfortable ride available today. I flew economy, and that was perfect, but the luxury afforded those upstairs in Business and First is unparalleled. The flight crew is very attentive to each passenger, no matter what the class of service. The food is great, and the seats give comfort to all sizes of people on this long trip.
The departure time is so cool because number 1, it's at 3:30 am...a time when Bangkok airport is almost empty. Anyone who knows this airport knows that big crowds mean long lines and poor service at all counters- especially Passport Control!  Number 2, the late departure time means you don't need to be at the airport until well after midnight, which gives you enough time for one more night in the big city! The taxi ride, if that's how you go, is much faster and cheaper because the traffic is so much better. I took the last train at midnight for only 40 baht and it was delightfully fast and uncrowded.
The other thing is the many connections to everywhere make it easy to accommodate all travel plans. You want to spend a  day/night in Dubai? no problem, the price doesn't change...want extra time for duty free? Great! For myself, I want just enough time to have a bite to eat, pick up a few things in the shops, and get to my gate...that goes like clockwork.
The last thing I can mention is that the atmosphere of travel is fantastic. It harkens back to the days when air travel was actually special. the whole trip is busy, but there is an air of excitement to the whole thing...the exotic destination of Dubai, the luxury of Emirates airlines and its excellent airplane, and the feeling you get when you get good value for whatever you pay."

There are however a lot of airlines vying for the top spots. One thing I was disappointed in was the service. On our aisle the attendant was slow and didnt return to ask whether we wanted a drink - I had to go and ask. Also when the button was pressed to summon an attendant one did not appear.
One appreciates that if there is a possibility of turbulence that you have to remain in your seat. However the sign was on for fully half an hour without any sign o turbulence. This meant that the toilets were locked, which proved a discomfort. There was in the end quite a queue for people waiting, which was dispersed."

On board luggage is a 7kg pack with a personal item as well. For some reason, This personal item is not allowed on the return flight from Accra (Africa).
Complaints fall on death ears because it is the policy. 
On coming back from Accra, I had bought an extra 5kg of luggage. I packed a second bag to for me, 2 bags total 36.. kg for me. Emirates employees checking me in at the counter wouldn't allow me despite me showing my receipt for the extra kilos. Apparently every one is allowed only one bag from Africa, and you cannot pack a bag over 34kg. So why did they (Emirates) charge me the extra $190 to buy the extra 5kg if they don't allow more than 1 bag per person in the luggage compartment under the plane?
I ended up throwing away some items in Accra, including my extra bag before making the weight to get a boarding pass. I wasted money on extra luggage and lost money on items I had to throw away at kotoka airport."

I have been on zillions of intercontinental flights it doesn't take 2 1/2 hours to heat up the meals.  She said, it will be done in 5 minutes.  It was done in 45 minutes.  Meanwhile, there were no refreshments served as we waited for these elaborate meal preparations.  Similarly, the flight from Dubai to Bangkok did not serve anything to passengers for about 2 1/2 hours.  I do not understand this because passengers will refrain from eating at the airport when they know they will have a meal on the plane.  They are waiting for this meal.  And at least, if they have to wait so long, they should get a refreshment beforehand.  Plus all the flight attendants were all standing around in the kitchen laughing and talking for these 2 hours.  It made a terrible impression.  To be fair, EK 372 was not quite so blatant in this respect as EK 92.

Interestingly, on the way back, both flights (to Dubai and then to Milan) served meals on time.

Though this is also common, and we did get our baggage delivered to our home, what was shocking to notice is a valuable bracelet of my wife (apart from the monetary value it also had sentimental value as it was a gift to her) was missing from her luggage. And it was clearly visible from the condition of the bag that someone had intentionally opened the bag to find and steal some valuables, and they had managed to do so.

While we understand that the airline clearly states that they are not liable for any lost valuables from checked-in luggage, one does not expect something like this to happen when they are flying Emirates.

Was a little disappointed that they didnt notice the fact my son was wearing a sunflower lanyard due to being autistic. We did phone Emirates to let them know we were travelling with them and that my son has autism and would need special assistants for boarding and getting off. Unfortunately this was not put on to our details but once we spoke to them we were within the first group to board after first class and business. We were sat in the centre with 4 seats together which we picked free of charge 48 hours before we took off. 

Our children were super excited to be on a plane only the second time of going aboard for them. It wasn't long before the stewards were handing out the kids gifts my son received his first he was over the moon to receive a wash bag containing bits and piece his favour item tho was the emirates socks. Unfortunately tho they only gave my son his gift and my daughter was waiting ages for her's. My son is 11 and my daughter is 9 my daughter recieved a colouring book and crayons you can imagine she was a little disappointed after seeing what her brother recieved but we guessed maybe he had something different due to having the lanyard on. Then they started serving the food they served my son his first then my husband recieved his a couple of minutes later. My daughter and myself didnt get ours until a good 10 minutes later, I feel they should serve either side of the plane at the same time so if you are all sat together you can all eat together. The fight went really well after this and the children were well entertained with the games movies and music on board. When landing it was a free for all to get off which normally happens which is a shame as those with disabilities were left to just wait. We were fine waiting as our son does not like lots of people pushing and queuing ect but those that need wheelchair assistance were just left to wait around. I personally feel they should of got them off first.

The flight home was pretty much the same as going out with regards to them not noticing that my son would need help again we had to ask all the time, fine for us but some people dont like asking and it does get a little tiresome having to do starts to take a bit of fun out of it for all of us. The only difference on the flight home my son got the same style gift but a different colour and my daughter recieved a baby blanket and wrist rattle !!! Thankfully she likes soft blankets but I think they really need to look at the children and there ages with regards to giving gifts out.

After chauffeur service was dropped off by the check-in, a few seconds wait and a helpful check-in agent, fast track was dream no wait at all and made my way through endless duty free to the lounge.
Not an Emirates lounge after a few minutes wait, I was warmly welcomed and escorted to the far end of a very busy lounge to the section reserved for Emirates customers and offered Champagne
Food in the lounge was good and whilst the lounge itself was noisy and busy the Emirates section was much more relaxed. When it was time to board a short but very busy train shuttle ride to the gate  
Was escorted to my suite which whilst familiar was much more private, self contained and spacious than the 380.
The service on board was both fantastic and personal
So to compare 380 versus 777,  Gatwick and Heathrow lounges are larger and of course Emirates, the ability to board from the lounge a real advantage 
The 777 suite is much better when travelling solo but with a partner would choose the middle in the 380
To work in Dubai the ability to shower before landing and go straight to work is an advantage 
Both are great and so as not to forget it, the second leg in the """"old"""" First is still great

I called them to buy a ticket on Business Class, and when this was donne, the lady at the other side of the line, asked me for the name of my hotel in Sao Paulo. With curiosity, I asked why. She said, that Emirates had included, free of cost, a service of pick up at the airport, with a driver and a Mercedes Benz. This service was also available when I came back. I could not beleive it untill I drop of at Sao Paulo airport and saw the driver, very elegant, waitting for me and driving a Mercedes Benz C180.
The plane they use is a Boeing 777 300ER, and when you step on imediatelly you see the difference, starting with the hostess with that elegant and exotic dressing.
As soon as I took my seat, one of these hostess came and offered a cup of champagne, which was real french champagne, Veuve Clicquot. A cupple of minutes after the menu on board was offered to me, and again was pleasantly surprised. I only travel in business class and had never seen what I am going to tell.
Cocktails were 18. Gin was London One, Vodka, Ciroc, Whiskey only 15 or 18 years available, and so on. The meal was incredible and the wine list as well. You could choice from a French Cabernet Sauvignon, an Argentinian Malbec, or my choice which was Concha y Toro flagship wine, Don Melchor. An incredible wine that according to Decanter or Wine Spectator has all ways been ranked with 95 points and up. The seat were very comfortable, and in front had a 19 or 21 inch LCD where I saw a musical video relaxing back with more cups of Don Melchor wine. What is the best part of this story, is that the price of the air ticket of Emirates is the same one of Latam, which does,nt give a free pick up at the airport or this incomparable service aboard. Congratulations to Emirates."

It was an enjoyable experience, the food and wine list with Thai  or Emirates is much better though, as is the customer service in general. From other experiences I have had with Emirates it seems some flights (particularly those before  stopovers)  enjoy a better service and food options.

My partner and I booked Emirates specifically for the way home from what was a fantastic, accident free and smooth sailing European Christmas holiday. We had always heard great reviews and service and booked it as a treat for the long way home from Germany to Sydney. 

Over the course of 2 days Dubai received the most rainfall they usually do in a total year, unfortunately we landed right in the middle of it. Specifically choosing the 16 hour layover so we could see the city as opposed to the 4 hour was our biggest mistake as we got caught up in the disorganised mess which was to unfold over the next 48 hours. 

What was supposed to be a 22:00 flight on the 11th of January ended up being delayed 6 TIMES!! Until the 13th 10:00 AM! Luckily on the first night we were offered a hotel which was communicated was across the road from the airport - after nervously sitting on a coach bus with 30 other passengers driving for 45 minutes south of Dubai, ending up in a oil refinery having to do U turns because the bus drivers had no GPS no clue where they were going and spoke zero English. It didn‚Äôt stop there, when arriving at the hotel the lobby was packed with 100s of people, families, disabled, parents with newborns and no priority given to those that needed it most, it was every man for himself. Disgusting. Especially at 1 am after you‚Äôve been up all day searching for understanding of what to do from here. 

The following day we queued up about 9 hours at the transfers desk with no PA announcements, no communication from staff as to what to do or where to go, there was no food or water available in the terminal and we got hardly any sleep. 

I understand that this was a national emergency and it was a sticky situation but the handling by staff, team members walking off shift with no replacement and leaving 1 person behind the counter to serve 1000s that had come off flights that had no connection out, attitude of supervisors hiding in the managers office and not helping passengers is the worst I have ever seen in my many years of travel. 

After 2 days stuck in Dubai, and a total of 36 hours in the airport with nowhere to stay we made it onto a flight home. The calamity didn‚Äôt stop there. Flight attendant attitude was appalling. We were seated next to the galley and could hear the bickering and arguing over breakfast serving, one was chewing gum with her mouth open the entire trip, and to top it all off our special meal requests were not transferred onto this flight to which this attendant said ‚Äúsorry it isn‚Äôt on my list‚Äù and walked off without offering an option of what we could eat to make it through the 14 hours that lie ahead. 

My partner and I are savvy travellers, we seek to understand at the best of times and frequent other parts of the globe at least once a year. What was going to be a peaceful journey home ended up being
a nightmare from hell that I don‚Äôt wish upon anyone. Do yourself a favour and travel Qantas or Virgin where staff are well trained and supervisors take responsibility and genuinely wish to help you have a pleasant if not surviving journey. 

Emirates you have a lot of work to do. Since coming home it has taken me weeks to recover from the stress, anguish and anxiety that I felt over that 48 hours we were stuck in what felt like limbo. Staff need training and customer service upskilling, consider planning ahead with weather forecasts and emergencies and for gods sake use the airport PA in terminal 3!!! It‚Äôs there for a reason. I have never felt so relieved to touch down on Aussie soil in my life. Paying more doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean better service, never ever flying with Emirates again."

In the end They finally get my two kids for their kids meal and the cabin crew said to me ‚Äúsorry coz the oven broke down‚Äù 
I was not pleased coz they could have informed me in advance so I said to them ‚Äúwhy haven‚Äôt you guys informed us at all in advance and maybe ask if my kids would like to have some biscuits or something?‚Äù

Our outbound flight was a fantastic experience however it was rather different on our inbound flight. We had not one but two small children in Business Class who cried and screamed through the whole journey. We got no sleep whatsoever and rather than feeling fresh from our journey, we landed back in Heathrow both completely exhausted.

The onboard crew did nothing to help the situation and we both could not wait to get off the flight. It was horrendous!

On return home, we wrote to Emirates about our experience only to receive an apology and a some points to the value of about ¬£30 if that.

Not great customer service and we're unlikely to fly with them again.

I was driven to the airport and after checking in at a special counter whisked to the first class lounge where I indulged in a free 15 minute massage, shower, and relaxing light lunch and the lovely dining room.

When boarding time came the luxury continued. I entered the Magnificent 380 plane onto the upper deck and greeted by warm and friendly crew. As soon as I was escorted to my seat On the upper deck of the  380, I was offered a glass of the world‚Äôs finest champagne. With champagne flute in hand I began to explore every nook and cranny of my private closed door suite. 

Once we had reach cruising altitude I was asked what time I would like to have my meal and at what time I should have the shower room ready for me. Yes I could eat whenever I wanted and bath at a time convenient to me. I was indeed the master for the next several hours.

Once I decided to have my meal I realized that this was going to be a unlike any meal I‚Äôve had on a plane before. The dinner service tray with larger than I have ever seen and set up with an eye toward perfection. The selections were varied And culturally intriguing. I began with a small canopy of confit duck and a delicious sauce to be washed down with champagne. This was followed by a culinary delight ‚Äì a caviar presentation and cold vodka. I continued with the appetizers and took an Arab mezze appetizer platter consisting of six individual delicacies. Under normal circumstances I would‚Äôve ended my meal here but continued on with a main course of an Indian style chicken recipe with the fluffiest rice I have ever had. A carafe of Bordeaux wine accompanied the meal and then onto a cheese presentation and dessert. If this weren‚Äôt enough chocolate and cognac ended this culinary experience.

For me to take a flight for 14 or 15 hours, required a lot of pre-thought. I decided to take Emirates, because I'd flown them before, and was very pleased with the treatment I received. And, I want everyone to know that I highly recommend Emirates for long flights. The seats, in Business Class, turn into small single beds, which, are certainly comfortable enough, for  a 6 ft tall person like myself. The service on the flight is excellent, and the crew does whatever it can to make you  comfortable. There are an amazing number of films, both pretty new and classic, TV series to watch, a bar in the back where you can have a drink of high quality alcohol, have a snack, or simply sit and talk with other passengers. And very important for someone like me, there are several bathrooms, and I never had to wait to use one. For those who wish a mattress-like cover for your seat, they are brought shortly after takeoff. Overall, I would highly recommend Emirates Business Class, especially on their  Airbus 380 flights. Sadly, airplane food is airplane food, and no matter how many choices you get, and you get quite a few on Emirates, airplane food is never great. However, the food on Emirates is as good as it gets in the air. The snacks in the back at the bar are very good. If you can, Emirates Business Class is as good as any airline flying today."

This was my first long-haul flight and chose to go with the middle ranged priced airline, Emirates based on recommendation. I am an anxious flyer and came prepared with all medical documentation required and also called the main Emirates customer service line to ensure they were aware. Upon arriving at Gatwick to Dubai staff were very attentive and helpful and the flight was great. Happy and attentive staff - same for the return flight. However, one awful experience of customer service made me feel extremely uneasy and enough to put me off travelling altogether for a while and enough to ensure I will never use Emirates again. The long-haul flight from Dubai - Sydney, 14 hours the Cabin Crew where barely seen other than when it was meal times. I was happily seated on my paid for window seat at the back, which I paid for in order to help with my anxiety. My anxiety was at ease, especially from the experience I had on the previous flight, and my next set of anxiety medication was due so I hit the buzzer for an attendant as my partner next to me and another traveller on the aisle seat where sleeping. After 20mins of waiting i then caught a member of crew walking past and asked if i could just have some water for my medication. They said yes they would ask a colleague to bring some over. Another 10mins passed, my anxiety was rising and also my medication was now becoming more overdue. I ended up waking my partner and I became very anxious and a panic attack was trying to come out, my partner pushed the buzzer again and we were still ignored. After an hour from initially pushing the buzzer, we gave up, my anxiety was through the roof, I woke up the traveller in the aisle seat and went to get my own drink so I could take my medication. This then left me very uneasy that the cabin crew completely ignored this situation and left me feeling very uneasy that they would be able to cope with an emergency situation. My inflight entertainment screen did not work, and whilst I understand this is not the end of the world, it would have been helpful to then put at ease the heightened anxiety I was experiencing due to the lack of care from the onboard cabin crew. My partner also asked if it was possible to have a fizzy or alcoholic drink half way through the flight and the attendant told him no, he'd need to get his own water from by the toilet!
The return flights, I will admit I had a completely different experience with one cabin crew member walking through checking that we were all happy and comfortable and extremely attentive staff. It made such a difference, but after the first experience, I was very anxious that I was going to receive the same sort of service. I also was able to access snacks etc on the return flights which were NOT available to access on the flight out, the staff where mainly chatting at the very back of the plane which I believe was not for travellers access.

3.If you are flying Solo please avoid middles seats of 4 in a row as there are very mixed kind of passengers whom you won't be comfortable with to travel in long flights.

5.They serve a good range on alcoholic drink , especially good for whiskey lovers but restrict yourself to a maximum 3 if you are in the economy.

B777 again to Bangkok, welcomed by attendants and decided to get the heads down as soon as possible. Got 5 hours sleep and was woken by flight attendant for breakfast service. Early into Bangkok and 2 hours before our final flight to Koh Samui. This flight was a codeshare by Bangkok Airways and was operated on an Airbus A319 with no business seating available only took 40 minutes and even got a meal onboard. Return flights were also very good even got to use the Bangkok Airways lounge at Koh samui as well as the Emirates Business class lounge in Bangkok. Slightly late back into Glasgow because of the very strong headwinds from the numerous storms that were battering Europe at that time. Will definitely use Emirates again as service is second to none in my opinion."

Checked bags in at airport, spoke to Customer Services and were told they had no authority to change seats as flight was over-booked (not my problem). Was then told to speak to Customer Services at connecting destination who have more authority - spoke to them who passed responsibility back to original check-in desk. Was then told to speak to Customer Services at the Gate - to which no surprise to us - was told they had no authority and passed responsibility back to check-in at original departure location. On each occasion we told it is Emirates Policy NOT to split families however no one was willing to take responsibility and no one was willing to resolve the issue. Very distressing and upsetting for my wife and children to sit separate from their father for the duration of a 9hr flight.

The flight from Stockholm to Dubai was fine, the service was what we expected, however on the flight from Dubai to Bali the plane was very cold (the only time I have ever had to sue a blanket on a plane) and the service average - this might have been as it was a night flight 2am - 3.15pm?

The return flights were much the same but as we had booked the same seats on all flights we noticed that it was almost as if we were forgotten when it came to food and drinks. The air crew were more stressed it seemed than those on the outward trip.

The seats were much the same as all aircraft, the was a good amount of leg room, however with longer flights airlines should have more foam padding in the seat as they become uncomfortable after about 3 hours."

The Steward came back a few minutes later to say that the flight was full so there were no other seats to move to, felt my seat, handed me four blankets to sit on and said that the Cabin Manager had said that """"no-one would have spilt on my seat, it gets wet because of it's position to the galley"""".
On my return home I submitted a complaint to Emirates, my point being that if the seat is known to get wet, why do Emirates make the seat available. I was credited with Emirates miles, apologised to and told there were no logged defects, so my wet seat must be down to condensation. I have sent several responses, including requesting that they contact the Cabin Manager for clarification of their comments. However Emirates have refused to do this and said that is their final position.
Emirates are no longer a member of an ADR so I cannot take my complaint any further, so I feel the only thing I can now do is never fly with Emirates again, write this review and have told all my family and friends of what I had to endure on the flight and the appalling customer service I have subsequently received."

Whilst everyone else seems to put more and more seats with less and less legroom in their economy cabins, Emirates was a wonderful surprise.  Spacious seats, lots of legroom and the inflight entertainments was fabulous.  I caught up on the movies I'd missed this year and my husband was the most content I have ever seen him browsing the sports channels. Food was very reasonable.  A better offering than most economy meals and the bar service was excellent.  Cabin crew were helpful courteous and always available.

Inbound and outbound I had to address 2 sets of parents as their unruly children were either kicking the back of the seat or playing with the tray by flipping it up and down. I asked for assistance from the air hostess who did speak to both sets of parents of these children and in the end I was moved to another seat away from my family.
The food was adequate,the range of drinks available was adequate and the seat was comfortable enough in Economy.  I did liase with the customer servivces team for Emirates prior to our departure to ask whether they would give my dad a glass of champagne as we were travelling in for his 80th. However, all we received back was a price list for $95 for a bottle of champagne (750ml) and birthday cake priced at $30. Other airlines such as Virgin Atlantic and BA may not be as highly ranked as Emirates but they do cater for their travellers with certain requests at no extra charge if within reason.
Emirates is a multi billion pound firm and I am sure 1 glass would not have broken them or put them out of pocket-Disappointing"

In fact when we flew Heathrow to Dubai, the on board crew were warm, friendly and welcoming, making the flight with two young children a lot easier and comfortable. This professional and customer focused attitude is something we have previously associated with Emirates airlines.
The crew on this flight however, were a disappointment to all their other colleagues and the company itself. 
They were unfriendly and not accommodating to customers needs- I noticed someone ask for some water only to be told ‚Äònot now!‚Äô And my wife had the same venomous response when she asked an empty-handed member of staff to clear our 3 year old daughters meal tray.
I could go on about how other customers were also left waiting for their drinks to the point where they informed individuals that these could not be brought out now as the plane was descending.
The distinct lack of professionalism by this crew was shocking to say the least, something which management need to look into as a matter of urgency; sending them for further customer service training.
