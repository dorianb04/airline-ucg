10.3865346908569,9.13848876953125,"Asiana Flight Review",4,"We actually had a good experience flying from Busan, S Korea to Osaka, Japan!  First, we were blessed with an angel customer service agent at Busan Airport.  The security lines at Busan are disorganized and inefficient.  I was in a wheelchair, and this angel took it upon herself to find us and escort us to the handicapped security entrance. (Which was not well marked.). Instead of waiting a very long time, and possibly missing our flight, we breezed through.  Thank you!  (Advice - Arrive WAY more than 2 hours in advance of your flight.) The flight itself was comfortable, although no frills.  They did not even serve water.  I believe the flight was actually Air Busan, in a partnership with Asiana.  They DID provide a snack.  No wifi.   No movies.  Still it was a fairly short flight, and there were no issues."

From my perspective, the large rip was caused by something sharp that ran through my suitcase.  I considered it was resulted from rough baggage handling by Asiana.  I filed a compliant with them.  They have denied my claim twice based on their policy that they won't replace or repair the damage because they expect this kind of damage with normal luggage handling.   I disagree their assessment and decision.  
Asiana is putting the full burden on its customers when Asiana is at fault.  I was a new customer of Asiana and I will not fly Asiana again."
10.3085041046143,11.77796459198,"Asian Airline Comparison",1,"Asiana is a primitive airline that does not take any accountability or priority for customer service. We booked a return flight from Tokyo to San Francisco in advance and there was a connection in Seoul, South Korea.

Admittedly, we assumed the connecting flight was at the same airport but Asiana sold us a flight from Haneda to Gimpo, with our transfer to San Francisco being at Incheon.

This is an illogical travel itinerary that no one would willingly book because this requires you to claim your luggage, leave customs, travel to another airport at least one hour away, and reenter security again. Asiana should not be offering such a flight on their booking system. I have never experienced this with any other airline or country.

The Asiana staff at Haneda guaranteed that despite the airport transfer inconvenience, there is at least free shuttle from Gimpo to Incheon that takes 1.5 hours.

Upon our arrival at Gimpo, we learned there was no such shuttle and the Asiana staff at Gimpo advised us to either take the city bus or a taxi. They offered no reimbursements or complimentary vouchers of any sort and suggested we complain on their website.

Since we had to pick up 4 checked-in luggage to leave Gimpo, a city bus was not feasible for us because of our baggage so we paid for a $100 taxi to Incheon.

Upon arrival at Incheon, we were told one of our boarding passes was missing information so we had to go to a special desk to get our boarding pass. We had no issue getting our boarding pass from Haneda to Gimpo so this surprised us.

When we expressed our frustration to Asiana at Incheon, the staff said it’s not them, “it’s America.” I’m not sure what that means.

Additionally, when we booked our tickets, we had assigned seats next to each other but the clerk said seats were sold out and had us separated. The ticket that was “missing information” was also flagged for a required additional security interview.

We are waiting in line at security as we are writing this. This whole fiasco cost us way more time and energy than traveling should require. We will not be flying with Asiana again."
10.3048133850098,11.7905578613281,"Asian Airline Comparison",1,"I could understand that the current snow situation at South Korea is unexpected but if Asiana flew my family from Singapore to Incheon, then they should know that there is a connecting flight from Incheon to Fukuoka since both flights are from the same airline and they should plan for it and not allow them stranded at Incheon airport without any lodging and food and ask them to find their ways to fly out of Incheon themselves. Where is their responsibility? You seriously allowing your reputation going down the drain. For info, the tickets are booked directly from Asiana App and not through a third party. No more Asiana."

8.46486759185791,7.82245874404907,"Airline Seating Review",2,"We flew on Asiana's Airbus A380-800 on the upper deck economy class to and from Incheon Airport.  The seats were very, very hard on both flights.  We had to put a pillow on top of our seats to make them more comfortable to sit on.  Still didn't help.  The seats on their 777-200ERs are much more thicker and much more comfortable. 

We have flown the same route several times but it appears that they have cut down on their meal service.  The gap between meals was about 10 hours and nothing was served in between.  No mid-flight snacks given.  In addition, on our previous flights with Asiana, flight attendants walked around the cabin for water and coffee service throughout the flight.  They were working nonstop to keep passengers comfortable. 
This time, we only saw them do that a few times.  It seems that Asiana Airlines have also cut down on coffee service and drinking water service as well.  Now, you have to request to get water on the flight. 

Their A380-800 is aging and needs some upgrades, especially the seats.  Flight attendants now are not as friendly as before.  Seats on the A380 are worn out and dirty. 

The boarding process both from LAX and ICN are very chaotic.  After Business Class passengers boarded, they let everyone in Economy Class board all at the same time. It would be more organized if they board the people in the back first and work towards the front of the plane.  As a result, boarding was very stressful because a lot of people ahead of us were blocking the aisle to store their luggages on the bins so it took longer to get to our seats.  Asiana has to find a better way to board passengers.

I hope Asiana reads this review.   I don't believe we will fly Asiana again in the near future because of our """"not so pleasant"""" flight experience."

The food was ordinary and not what should be expected in business class.  The flight crew was gracious and attentive, but again, not exceptional.

The Asiana lounge had limited and I highlight """"limited"""" selection of food and beverages.   The lounge was a disappointment.

The only great part was the flat bed for a long haul flight."

The food was excellent and flight attendants were the hardest working people I have ever seen. The seats layed down flat and everything worked, which was refreshing.

Drinks choice was fruit juice, water or coke, no alcohol or hot drinks"
9.80377578735352,9.76155567169189,"Asiana Flight Review",5,"The trip from Seoul to New York was long, but I'd read your reviews and decided the business class product was worth the fare, which was more than competitive. I'd been looking forward to the Korean """"lunch"""" (at 10:30 am local time) for nearly a year. When the FA came back to tell me they had run out of that choice, I shared my considerable disappointment. She recommended another choice, which she brought, that was composed of food that had been set aside for the crew. It was the best meal I have ever had on any airline. I am nearly a Million Miler on United and am grateful that I chose to fly on Asiana. I would highly recommend Asiana to anyone flying a long-haul from the far east to the USA."

Even though Asiana is currently owned by a korean company, it was like night and day.  First the plane was full.. of korean and chinese passenger and they were up all night and day talking, singing and walking around with raised voices.  I couldnt understand any of the announcement made over the PA system if anything was happening.  The passengers were out of control and rude.  The seat was very hard and very little leg room. After two hours i couldnt sit in my seat anymore.   The food was medicre and it was a mix of korean and american.  I will never fly this airline again. I would gladly pay extra and fly Korean Airlines."

I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with a recent flight experience and to seek appropriate remediation. My travel involved seats 12J and 12K, which unfortunately were located directly in front of passengers in 13J and 13K who were visibly and severely ill, including a child who was incessantly coughing and playing with the seat table. I want to be clear, this is not on the child but the parent and your associates who failed to enforce, what I believe, are basic health guidelines.

Despite the expectation that individuals in such poor health would not be allowed to fly, it was evident that this was not the case. The constant noise and illness from behind made the flight highly uncomfortable, despite using headphones to block out the sound. The only relief was when this person was sound asleep.

It was so bad that my spouse alerted a stewardess. That stewardess let us know that they already offered a mask. This signifies to us that they were well aware this person was very sick and allowed them to fly regardless.

Here are my concerns and suggestions for improvement:

1. **Online Check-In**: I would appreciate it if online check-in were available for international passengers with passports. This would streamline the process, especially for those traveling from abroad.

2. **Seat Assignments**: When passengers pay extra for seats together, it should be standard practice to ensure those seats are assigned together. It would greatly enhance the passenger experience.

3. **Health Declarations**: I believe the health declaration process needs to be enforced more rigorously. If passengers appear to be significantly ill, appropriate actions should be taken to maintain the health and safety of all travelers. If there is no current health declaration policy, implementing one would be beneficial.

4. **Health and Safety Protocols**: Clear and enforced health protocols are essential. Knowing that the airline prioritizes health and safety would allow passengers to travel with greater confidence.

The discomfort and potential health risks I experienced due to the poorly managed situation are unacceptable. I trust you will take this feedback seriously and make the necessary changes to improve the travel experience for future passengers. 

I think, with all the many health concerns going on, this airline would do better

Sincerely,

We end up paying extra legroom fee for nothing and need to waste a lot of time tring to request for refund, which at this point still can not contact airline at all.

we booked for a extra legroom with additional fee. However, during our online check in process, the system forced me to normal seat and unable to select extra legroom as those seats are fully occupied.

At check-in counter, i raised the my problem to the staff. At first they just refuse the fact that we paid for extra fee. But after we showed some proof of documents, they paid more attention to their system and confirmed that we booked and paid for extra legroom, however they can not arrange the seat for us as the plane model has been change from Airbus to Boeing and no seat is available. The staff told that they can not do anything and will need us to contract customer service ourself.

we tried to call customer service USA and the system kept us waiting for more than 15 mins where we can not further effor the wait and decide to contact the customer service again in Thailand. We called to Thailand customer service also no reply. We tried to contact the airline via email, no email avaialble but only chatbot. however, chatbot basically can't support our case. Even when we tried to select the refund option in system, the system required us to input departure date which is in past month but force us to select only current month or future so basically we can not contact the airline no matter how hard I try.

The fact that the airline can not honour the prebooked extra legroom without any timely notification is bad enough but now I have to feel upset wasting a lot of time trying to contact airline for such amount of fee. very questionable way of doing businesss."

The hosties may call it """"beef with rice"""" and its great. Website is tricky to manage your bookings.

While I, as a customer, could complain about a variety of issues I had, I would like to speak for the elderly woman beside me who could not speak for herself. During our 11 hour flight from Incheon to San Francisco she tried for several hours to sleep. However, when she would slump forward the touch screens would be activated and the light would shine in her face. When I asked a stewardess to help her, the stewardess laughed. I asked if the screen could be disconnected, or if the woman could be moved to a more comfortable seat. The stewardess and her co-worker laughed at this. Is it common practice for Asiana Airlines to mock their customers? Is it typical of Korean people to find the pain of others amusing? I admit i don't know very many, and this interaction made a poor impression. Needless to say, the poor woman was tortured for the rest of the flight, and no doubt, exhausted from lack of sleep. I didn't speak her language, but I understood her pain, and did my best to accommodate her.

Needless to say I will not be flying with Asiana Airlines again, and I would encourage other travelers to find alternative accommodations."

They terribly damaged my baby’s stroller at gate check. It was placed in a padded stroller bag. The bag was ripped on one side, stroller seat connector broken indicating very rough handling — it literally says on the bag “stroller handle with care”.. This is an uppababy stroller so also very solid and sturdy. My baby was 15 months old then, so having a broken stroller the moment we landed in a foreign country for our vacation was not easy to deal with.

We immediately notified the staff when we received the stroller at our gate. They took a lot of pictures, reported everything and then I never got any resolution.

They have good amenities for every seat (slippers, toothbrush, comfortable seat in “newer” planes). They were on the more affordable side - which makes sense because of all the cons I had. 

I read all the previous reviews before booking and thought people were exaggerating but boy I was wrong.
1: These planes are ANCIENT! Not much air conditioning, flight entertainment was basically nonexistent, and no wifi on board (at least our prehistoric plane didn’t have any). I flew four flights in total with all the layovers and one of our screens looked like I was in the 1950s watching a Godzilla movie. The quality and font was so outdated.
2: Meals… We had a lactose intolerant person on our group so we noted that on our booking. They accommodated the request, but it was probably one of the worst smelling, blandest foods we’ve ever seen. It was salmon and bland potatoes for every. single. course. We had four flights so do the math on that. What’s interesting was the regular food had no lactose included in the meals other than the yogurt so they could’ve just taken that out and served it like other airlines would. Also, the food just was unappetizing in general, so our party just ended up skipping the meals at the end. 
3: Service. The service alone made me never want to book with them again. The flight attendants were a bunch of snooty Korean girls that were so ingenuine. There was a language barrier sometimes which is fine. We went to Vietnam and Japan and there was a language barrier at some points but NO ONE got mad like these Korean flight attendants did. The check in desk lady in Japan was explaining that we were to stop in Korea as a layover but the language barrier made it seem like she was saying something completely different. We were a bit confused and she got pissed off that we weren’t understanding and was snarky about it. All that was done with their fake smile which creeped us out. Also during our flight I got up behind a flight attendant to use the restroom (I’m a woman btw) I had to go really bad but they were still serving food so there was a line to reach the restroom which is fine… no worries about a wait. However, we accidentally bumped into each other at one point and she turned around and SCROWLED at me. It was a genuine accident but it’s like I unleashed her inner fake attitude or something."

The bathrooms were clean which I really appreciated it. I think its cleaned after few uses.

My sister's luggage was 19kgs and mine was 26kgs. We asked Miss Oh Ji Yeon 오지연 to check in our luggage together as a family (total: 45kgs). She refused and said we can only check in 1 by 1. For my own luggage, since it was over the 23kgs limit, I was told to pay 60,000 won for the additional weight. I felt it was unreasonable because the combined luggage weight is less than 46kgs for the bag limit for 2 people.

We decided to repack our luggage, re-weight repeatedly to ensure that both luggage were within the individual limit. I was very upset with this inflexibility and honestly, it is just transferring and balancing the weight of the luggages. While we were packing, she came over and told us to hurry up when we were trying our best to repack the luggage.

When we went back to the counter and placed the luggages onto the conveyor, she rolled her eyes at us and gave a snickering smile to her colleague. It was very disrespectful and I felt very offended. However, I was looking forward to going home and I did not want to pursue any further.

We always love South Korea and met many nice people during our travels. It was absolutely distasteful to end this wonderful trip with the worst customer service at the airport with Asiana Airlines."
10.3972997665405,5.4575138092041,"Asian Airline Comparison",1,"I recently had the worst travel experience of my life with Asiana Airlines, and I strongly advise others to avoid flying with them. My journey from Jinan to New Delhi,via seoul  through them, turned into a nightmare due to the airline's incompetence and poor customer service.
Upon arrival at Jinan Airport, the airline staff refused to issue boarding passes for both legs of my journey, citing the short layover time in Seoul. They said they can only provide the boarding pass for the Jinan to Seoul flight and instructed me to obtain the Seoul to Delhi boarding pass upon arrival in Seoul. Additionally, they mentioned that a minimum layover time of 3 hours is required in Seoul while their connecting flight layover time was 1.5 hr, and any delay could result in my deportation back to China. 
This is completely unacceptable, and it raises the question of why the airline would even accept a booking with such a short layover if it is not allowed.
The situation was further exacerbated by the rude and uncooperative behavior of the ground staff. They refused to document our complaint or provide any written confirmation, and they wouldn't share the contact details of senior personnel for escalation. We managed to capture a photo of one of the staff members involved, Ms. Weng Peng, but this did little to alleviate the situation.
This entire ordeal has been incredibly disappointing and frustrating. Asiana Airlines failed to provide even basic customer service, and their handling of the situation was completely unacceptable.
In summary, Asiana Airlines is a company to avoid. Their poor planning, lack of communication, and rude staff make for an utterly terrible travel experience. Save yourself the trouble and choose another airline.

They lost our bags, falsely claimed the airline that completed the first leg of our trip had the bags when the bags were in their possession, then took the entire week to get the bags to us, and then did not have a courier approved once the bags did finally arrive at the local airport to deliver them to our local address as is always customary with any upstanding airline in these types of situations."

However, once the line started moving, it went like a factory. There was numerous staff working and they sent people on the flight with the speed of light. It was probably the fastest we’ve ever boarded a plane before.

The staff on board was abrupt, quick, and short. The greeting was delivered matter of factly. Service was very quick with only two words spoken at a time.

The food choices were not explained. They only stated chicken or beef. I ended up with Korean food that I did not understand nor liked. I tried but didn’t eat anything except the rice and beef. I asked for water and received a half full small cup of about 2 oz. 

Movies were very limited. There were very few new releases of between 5-6 months old. They also had a few old movies. We did not received a water bottle for an 11 hour flight. The snacks were very good. I knew from Qatar that if you wanted snacks, you should go and ask for them. They gave me a tender and tasty cake and a thick and soft chocolate chip cookie. Lunch before landing again was announced as chicken or seafood. I should have asked more questions because the seafood was actually shrimp. I ended up with chicken with some fatty parts that I didn’t enjoy a lot.

But unfortunately I have to say that either water or food ran out during the flights (non-stop), for example. The crew members often had to apologize to us. Then, on non-stop flights, for example, the headset holders or the slippers/flip-flops were only handed out on request. In the meantime, such things are a matter of course on long non-stop flights. The food is mediocre. Very little fresh fruit on board. Snacks are also not offered. The selection of movies is okay. I must also say that the furnishings show their age (torn upholstery, old blankets). Everything is a bit run-down."

I’m on the smaller side so space and leg room was not a problem. The inflight entertainment was fine with lots of variety.  

The not so good: if you have dietary requirements you have no choice or notice in what you get. I had let the airline know beforehand and thought it to be a simple switch to ensure I didn’t have the meat options. While everyone else got a choice from two meals of a nicely presented platter of meat & vegetables, rice, soup, and cake, I had a pot of fruit with either a bland curry or the saddest looking tomato and cucumber bread roll wrapped in cling film.

The service from the flight attendants is poor, the food on board is not tasty - the meat was so tough that we returned the food back. Mold was found on the buns given to eat? The board itself is very worn, the blankets are dirty, most likely they have not been washed for a long time.

I honestly don’t think my experience on the plane could’ve been any better—it was all just perfect. And my first ever experience on a 747, if I might add!

The views were spectacular throughout the journey, and I absolutely loved watching the thick, massive 747 wing buffet through the choppy winds on final approach into KIX. Well, or should I say TWO final approaches!? The pilots aborted the first landing attempt presumably due to windshear, so I basically got two 747 approaches for the price of one. 

And of course as far as the actual service experience on board, I savored every minute. The flight attendants were very friendly and exhibited that classic Korean hospitality I’ve seen in vlogs on YouTube. Even in economy, I was offered a cup of water right as I sat down. The FAs were always around in the aisles and able to assist with any needs, and they didn’t mind that I walked up and down the cabin a few times to snap some photos of the 74 interior and out the back windows. The seats and IFE (in-flight entertainment) are dated, but I wasn’t here for the IFE…at least in screen form. My version of IFE was gluing my eyes out the window!!

Despite the go-around on final into Osaka, the flight arrived on-time, and my electric wheelchair was handled very efficiently. This flight, OZ114, is probably my very favorite of 2023, if not of all my life. Kudos to Asiana for keeping their 747-400 healthy for so long! Next up, I’ll have to try out their A380s."

It all started when I received an email saying my JFK - ICN leg was delayed by 4 hrs so I’d miss my connection to Hanoi. With a good 12 hrs before the flight, I wanted to use the time to ensure I had new connecting flight scheduled before I left JFK. 

The 800 number is NOT open 24/7. Their hours of operation are 07:00 - 22:00 pm PST and the system literally hangs up on you if their volume is too high. In fact my friend and I both called at the same time to try and get through. The system would even hang up on you after waiting 30 mins. When I finally reached a staff member she told me, they couldn’t do anything over the phone, I had to speak with someone at the desk at JFK and I may just have to figure out the connection to Hanoi when I arrived in Seoul. 

I arrived at JFK only to find out the rescheduled time on the email was wrong so I missed my flight. Their desk was literally a ghost town when I arrived and the monitor showed the flight was gone. As it turns out, the desk at JFK opens 2 hrs before the flight and closes 1 hr before the flight. Essentially there is a one hour window where you can talk to a human being or check in. 

I talked to the Delta ladies next door who were excellent. They told me that the Asiana staff had left for the day but they  helped track down  the line remaining Asiana rep. While I was happy to speak with a representative in the flesh, Deborah Kim, told me there was nothing she could do. She followed up by scolding me for being late. When I asked who could help me, she said she don’t know. When I started pushing back as I couldn’t get a soul to help me, she told me she had to go home and walked away. If I hadn’t have had the email with the proof of the wrong time, they were going to make me pay for another full fair business class ticket.  As you can imagine, getting rebooked felt like an act of God as their customer service was non existent.

In terms of the inflight experience, the chairs were comfortable and the crew kept the bathrooms very clean on all flights. Otherwise it was very mediocre. The in flight entertainment was extremely limited and the food was fair.  Not surprisingly, the Korean menu was definitely better than the US menu.  When I asked for help getting a bag down from the overhead on the JFK - ICN leg as they had repositioned it so I couldn’t reach it, the stewardess said I’d have to wait 3 hrs till we landed. The guy across the aisle thought it was ridiculous too and helped me out. The crew on the ICN - JFK leg was the best. They allowed me to sleep before having my first meal and generally tried to accommodate the passenger.  I slept both ways on the HAN - ICN leg but the head steward was really friendly and offered to feed me towards the tail end of the ICN - HAN leg."

The only thing I didn't like was when they did drink service, if we asked for a soft drink (soda) they would pout half the can into a cup and keep the other half for the next guest instead of giving the whole can. It worked out to be half a cup of liquid so we were always thirsty. (If you asked for beer you got the whole can).

Overall I'd say the flights were mediocre at best.  Business class seats were comfortable though a bit cramped for a western sized person.  Food ranged from bad to very good, depending on the plate being served.  Service was friendly and professional.   Website and associated customer service were awful.  

The biggest complaint I had with the flights were the stinginess with serving water.  For a long haul flight, the flight attendants should serve water every 1-2 hours to keep up with the dehydrating effects of flying.  I don't think I saw a flight attendant in the aisles between the meals.  When water was served, it was in tiny glasses.  Came away very dehydrated despite my best efforts.

A380 review:  Nothing special.  They are very quiet and there's a feeling of lumbering through the air that's different than smaller planes.  That's about it.  No bar, no lounge.   The other downside of an A380 is since it is double decked, being in business class does not offer the advantage of deplaning first to get a jump on immigration.  The lower deck starts emptying at the same time and you're fighting for position with the unwashed masses."

I will give a bit of back story. I was coming from the southern part of Jeju after a wonderful week in Jeju. It’s a definite must do if you are visiting South Korea. 
My airport transfer was delayed from the south (which takes about 1hr 20minutes to the airport).

I got the airport at 8:31am and boarding was at 8:35am. 
Self check in was closed at this point. 
I ran to the counter where the lovely lady checked me in, then I had to drop off my luggage at another counter which I ran too as well. A second amazing lady who checked in my luggage, literally walked to the belt to ensure my bag made it to be boarded. I then had to race to get to the foreigner passport check area which had the longest line. I thank God the line was actually moving. 

By the time I got to security I had 9 minutes before the flight departure time. I was certain at this point I wouldn’t be allowed to board the flight.. :(

This is when I saw the lady who had secured my luggage earlier, she was my truly an angel sent. It may seem like she was doing her job, but no! I also work in the tourism industry so I would know..
She didn’t have to, as it wasn’t her fault I hadn’t boarded.  She rushed me through security and “raced” with me to the boarding gate. I’m sorry for all the inconvenience, and that I didn’t get their names to thank them but I hope this review of gratitude is shared with them. Air Asiana should be soooo proud to have such amazing staff. Their service was truly the icing on the already amazing Jeju trip. Thank you once again."

Food reasonable no real complaints there though it would be nice if they let you know at the start of the flight what the refreshment schedule would be. In times past there used to be a card in the seat pocket explaining all that but this might be a modern day change everywhere TBF. On the plus side they keep you well hydrated with water and juice, but only OJ which can stick in your throat a bit if you're dehydrated. 

 If you plan an overnight stop at Incheon , don't get too complacent about """"not having to check in again"""". It still takes a good hour to get airside again the next day (not including time to walk to gate) because of their  very manual passport checking system and long queues for security.

The food offered some nice choices, but on my return flight, I found the entree to be very rich and salty. The flight attendants were great. The attendants at checkin were a bit rushed. In fact at Incheon, they did not even question the content of my luggage ( like do you have any flammables or batteries?) --as they did on my SFO start).

Most airlines we've flown with have arrangements to board those requiring assistance or families with young children first or by sections of the aircraft so that it is orderly.  Not so OZ at LHR,  where no announcements were made. It was managed poorly in our experience meaning customers were held up trying to get to their seats in the plane and took longer than necessary putting hand luggage away.  Gate staff did not show initiative to guide passengers that may need assistance to board first.

- Plane itself was clean and comfortable and toilets were kept clean thoughout the flight.  
- Food was Asian, as you would expect from an Asian airline and of good quality  We even got a hot rice dish for the short one hour flight between INC to DLC (both ways) which was a pleasant surprise. 
- Seats were comfortable and there was plenty of legroom.  My knees didn't kiss the seatback in front of me and I'm 1.85m tall. 
- Amenity kit containing single use slippers and a toothbrush/ toothpaste provided.  Combs and moisturiser available in the toilets.

- IFE was a bit poor though, with limited choice and the earphones were rubbish; couldnt hear the film track despite the volume being at full (on both outbound and inbound legs) and there was no choice for English subtitles on an English movie; so download some good movies/ programmes to your phone/ laptop to keep everyone amused as the flight is long, especially INC to LHR (14 hours).
- The inflight staff provided courteous, professional service but level of English we experienced can only be described as basic.  Bear in mind our flight was from and to an English speaking country so this could be improved upon.

The most disappointing contact that ruined our travel experience with OZ was at Incheon Airport at the check in desk on our way home.  Be aware that  the airline is VERY strict with their check-in baggage policy at INC and problems may arise when you use the self bag drop and then get sent to a ground agent at a counter.  We ended up being presented with a bill for excess baggage after the GA did not communicate to us that we would be charged after she just weighed our bags, labelled them, sent them on their way and attached a bill to our boarding card stubs.  No mention of whether we could repack, or what carry-on we were taking with us (to make more use of our carry-on allowance). It seemed she was more interested in seeing how much she could charge us for our 'excess' baggage.  Although appearing very apologetic at having sent our bags without giving us a choice to decide what to do with the excess, she kept telling us to pay at the excess counter.  

We were told to wait for an hour for the bags to be returned so we could repack/ dispose of items.  Deciding this was not acceptable, we spoke with a more senior staff member, who after various protestations from us, agreed to waive the charges and arrange for the bags to be sent on for loading.  This experience has left a rather sour end to our travel experience with OZ.

So fellow travellers please be reminded to check the exact weight of your bags before check-in at Asiana Incheon, as the ground agents have a totally inflexible common sense approach."

1) The """"random"""" security screening at the boarding gate (at Incheon airport) is crazily thorough (which is completely redundant to the security screening before we went through the security checkpoint before getting into the gate area), and the water was acquired inside of the gate area (from a lounge operated by the Incheon airport).  We were asked to take out *EVERY* single items from the carry-on luggage and open up every containers / bags / packages to inspect. To add to it, there were two inspection workers there (one seemed to be a trainee and the other seemed to be a trainer), and the trainer worker held a very unfriendly / arrogant attitude towards us. As the youngest member (a minor) of my family was being """"screened"""", the rest of my family wanted to make sure that no inappropriate actions would happen to her.  That trainer worker yelled at us and attempted to use rude body language (waving her hands) and facial expression to ask us to stay away.

2) The luggage handling at the destination was *REALLY* disappointing. Among my 25+ years of travel experiences, I'm going to have to say that this was the worst luggage experience where we didn't lose our luggage (yes, we lost our luggage once with another airline years ago, and that was THE worst travel experience).  Our flight was scheduled to land 12:45pm, and landed around 1pm. 15mins delay in landing is absolutely normal. Deplane process took a bit longer than usual flight (we waited for around 20mins, after arriving at the gate, before people were able to actually leave the plane). However, the luggage took another *2 HOURS* to arrive at the baggage claim carousel.  Most passengers didn't get their luggage until around 3pm local Seattle time. This is insane. What's worse is, due to the delay in luggage, the flurry of passengers from our flight collided with 3 other incoming flights. The US border / custom line was like the longest Disneyland attraction line winding through the entire arrival hall and around all the baggage claim carousels (like at least a thousand people). I've never seen anything like that at SeaTec airport (US border control), period. 

The luggage claim experience really tanked our trust and overall impression for Asiana Airline's Seattle airport ground operational effectiveness and efficiency. This has to change in order for them to remain relevant / in-business with increased competitions from Korean Air and other Asia-based airlines."

Two flights with Asiana were scheduled for the end of the trip via Korea. I did a PCR test in Adelaide to get into China, but the Asiana staff lady at check-in in Singapore initially even refused to weigh my bag, before she minutely scanned my $140 PCR test, only to say that it was a few hours out, and denied my boarding! This was because I had manually checked my luggage in Singapore from Malaysia Airlines, so this was considered to be a second flight and not the initial China bound flight the test required. She therefore considered it to be invalid as the test was done 48 hours before the first flight, not the last two flights (where I was regarded as leaving the airport to bring my luggage through to Asiana in T3). There was no remorse, help, or suggestions to re-book the flight or the possibly re-doing a test,  just a cruel callous statement, that I would not be able to fly, and I was left at the airport at my wits end at midnight with no flights or hotel!  I had to rebook the flight myself at my own expense, for a direct flight back to Beijing. The situation was so horrendous, that I don’t even know if I want to travel or fly again. I demanded to talk to the very young inexperienced manager. He was as helpful as he could’ve been, but ultimately of no help as all the staff went home by midnight. As I was in a predicament, and word got around, information desk staff came to assist me in the end and helped me to rebook the flight with Singapore Airlines.

You will not be able to make any changes to your flight, including something as simple as a luggage capacity increase.

If you call Asiana for any changes, they are also unable to increase the luggage capacity and divert any responsibility to the other airline, even though the luggage is passed directly to them during transit.

We realized the hotel our parents used to stay at is closed and reached out to the airlines for assistance. The response was it was our fault and we had to find out that hotel is no longer operating prior to buying tickets.

During this ordeal I was so flustered I also didn't realize she never applied the star alliance gold tags on my check in bag when she was finally processing me. If it wasn't out of malice, then it was out of incompetence. So not only was she rude, she was incompetent. Really Asiana? This is not a great way for customers to start their journey.

Flight was fine, flight attendant service was fantastic, food was pretty decent. If it wasn't for such abyssmal ground staff service I would not be writing this, and I'd continue to fly with Asiana. I feel so bad for the rest of the crew with exemplary service only to dragged down by garbage experience at the airport. This needs to be fixed."

We are a part of 4, 2 over 70, 1 80 years old and myself. Both the 80 year old and a 70 year old have back issues. We arranged for 1 wheelchair to assist the 80 year old. The fight attendants made no effort to help the 80 year old with her luggage (I was sitting at the other side of the plane with 2 passengers in between us so it was not possible tor me to always cross over to help). Luckily there was a nice gentleman in front of my aunt. I was carrying luggage for 4 people n they didn’t bother to assist either (plane was only 20% full when we bothered so it’s not like they were busy.) when the plane disembarked, they just took the person on the wheelchair away without letting us know, and when we finally found them we were not allowed to pass through immigration together. As you know, Korea is not really an English speaking party and it can be difficult for elderly to manage on their own yet our party was not allowed to cross together. Asiana fares are a little cheaper than other airlines but I guess you could say you pay for what you get: transport between countries and nothing else as they don’t bother to help you.

I bought tickets through the United Airlines website from Saipan to Sydney, and back. This involved a flight on Asiana Airlines from Saipan to Seoul, and Seoul to Taipei. About 4 hours before departure from Saipan, I received a call from Asiana Airlines saying that I will not be allowed to board because the flight involved a short transit in Taipei and Asiana Airlines said that is not allowed. They suggested that I call United Airlines to sort this out. It didn’t get sorted. 

The issue I have with Asiana Airlines is that as a matter of professionalism, courtesy and good customer service, it should have given me more notice. I purchased the ticket on May 11 but was informed only 4 hours before departure. I complained and they said “It is a courtesy and not the responsibility of Asiana Airlines to advise passengers upon checking in at the counter on any irregularities that might arise in their travel.”

That is troublesome. I wrote that they do not have an obligation but if they decide to give advise, they relinquish their obligation and need to ensure that the advise they give is reasonable and practical. Either they should have told me just before boarding that I cannot board or inform me well in advance. Four hours is not sufficient. They failed. Either give adequate advice, or don’t give advice. There is no half way mark. 

It seems another issue is the ground staff. When I spoke with the United customer service staff in Saipan, she said she knew about this issue because apparently the United Airlines and Asiana Airlines ground staff work for the same company. My guess is that certain functions are not carried out by Asiana Airlines staff but rather it is outsourced. I know of another Northern Pacific Island that has a similar arrangement. In that instance the airline acknowledged that not having their own staff on the ground did affect customer service. Perhaps this is the case with Asiana Airlines, a 5-star airline. As a customer, I am utterly disappointed. I will be flying soon again with Asiana due to limited choices."

About a dozen EN-language movies. That's it. Mostly unheard or unknown movies as well. Virtually no TV shows - inexcusable for a 13 hour flight. The boredom is beyond belief.

I had urgent medication in my suitcase and had to go to the international hospital in Seoul to get a new prescription - Asiana did not cover these medical costs.
The financial compensation is only 100USD for the delay in receiving the suitcase, and since they actually lost it, only 20 USD per kilo (which amounts to about 400USD, a lot less than the content of the suitcase was worth). Even these meager compensations I still haven’t received a month later.

This information WAS NOT volunteered by them and had I not specifically asked in advance, I would have used the convenience of the T3 test facilities and not been able to travel.

First, Asiana is using all Airbus equipment.  For the long haul from Seattle to Seoul,
not nearly as nice as flying a Boeing Dreamliner.  Much noiser aircraft, no matter where you are in the cabin.  The English entertainment choices are highly limited and seem focused on small children -not good.  The crew hide inside the galleys and make zero effort to assist passengers outside of the scheduled service times.
I stood up to stretch my legs after 12 hrs and they had a fit.

For the leg from Incheon to BKK, the Airbus 330 has miserable seats that are hard as rocks.  A normal sized passenger will not be comfortable.

9.00919342041016,7.40521717071533,"Airline Seating Review",1,"I was really dissapointed with this airline. The flight was indirect and I had to transfer in Incheon, Seoul. From Frankfurt to Seoul, almost all passengers were Korean, so maybe that's why the attendants didn't speak English when they served food/drinks or gave some live instructions during the flight, which I found very uncomfortable because I don't speak any Korean and thus didn't understand what they were saying. THAT WAS AN INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT, not a domestic one! Until one attendant came and asked what I wanted for my dinner in Korean (I guess), I asked her to speak English to me, she started to communicate with me in English. But then some other attendants came and spoke Korean until I asked them to speak English to me. The food served was ok, in-flight service was not too bad. Each passenger will be given a pair of cloth slippers which are very pleasant for your feet in a long flight.

However the drama began when they suddenly changed my return flight from Vietnam to Germany halfway. I said """"halfway"""" because they shifted the flight from Nha Trang to Seoul one day back while keeping the date unchanged for the flight from Seoul to Frankfurt, which means if I followed the schedule, I would miss the flight back to Germany. It was completely their fault. When I called the reservation center in Korea and required them to put both flights from Nha Trang to Seoul and from Seoul to Frankfurt on the same date, they agreed. Yet when I checked my email for the new ticket, the flight from Seoul to Frankfurt was set on a different date than what had been discussed on the phone. I had to call the center again and asked them to change and check carefully before they send me the ticket. That was very uncomfortable and time-consuming. Regarding the reservation center, even though I did as guided to get through to English-speaking assistants, I still had to speak with two Korean-speaking only operators until I could talk to an English-speaking assistant, which made me extremely confused and annoyed.

Last but not least, Incheon International Airport barely gives new instructions or notice (spoken and written) in English, but in Korean (of course) and in Chinese, as if they only considered Chinese passengers their international guests. This made my experience with Asiana Airlines even worse.

I will never fly with Asiana Airlines again."

I am writing this letter today, after having spent my first 2 months in Sydney and settled enough to take the time to do this properly:
 I travelled from Seoul to Sydney on the 30th of December 2019, and I was lucky enough to have my first flight with Asiana airlines! My journey had started the day before; I went from Paris to Frankfurt on the 29th, and from Frankfurt to Seoul. I still had an 8hours layover in Incheon before the last flight that would take me to my destination: Sydney. I was exhausted during my South Korean layover; I was carrying quite a few pieces of luggage with me, and I fell asleep on a couch in the airport.   When the time came to board into my OZ 0601 flight, I grabbed my stuff (or so I thought..) and boarded. About a second before the airplane’s doors were closed, I realised I had forgotten some of my stuff under the seat I had fallen asleep on, inside the airport. And crazily enough, that precise stuff was actually the most precious to me: my laptop and external hard drives. Although I need the laptop to work on a daily basis, my external hard drives contained my whole personal AND professional life of the past 10 years, and I was absolutely hopeless. The crew told me that there was no way I could go get my belongings back because the plane had to take off very soon. I saw those airplane doors closing right in front of me, and I felt completely lost, angry at myself, and helpless.. Very soon after that and a bit before taking off, a very nice flight attendant (H.E Jeon) came to me and told me that they would do their very best to help me. A very kind man (whom I think was the cabine crew manager), C.W.Sung came to speak to me shortly after to ask me more details about my belongings and their whereabouts, and assured me they were doing everything they could. He came back to me a couple of times to ask for more details and follow up on what was going on: if I understood well, one of their staff at Incheon airport (Ms. Ham) went to the place I had forgotten my belongings and retrieved it before handing it to her boss, Mr.Shin. C.W Sung explained me that one of their team members would take it with them on the next flight from Seoul to Sydney, and that I should get everything back within 48hours.Obviously, while feeling truly relieved that my stuff was found by Asiana Airlines employees, I was still pretty shaken up and I knew I wouldn’t feel absolutely serene until I could physically retrieve it, in Sydney. Mr. Sung and his team were very, very kind at all stages though, and as a matter of fact, within 48 hours, after a few phone calls and an extra round trip to Sydney airport, I did retrieve everything at Asiana Airlines’ offices at Sydney’s airport.  It is the first time I go live somewhere that far away from home, and it was also the first time I lost something that I held so close to my heart. So I guess the reason I am writing today is to let you know that your Asiana Airlines team did an amazing job in terms of client services that day, and I will not forget it. I truly wanted to thank them again for everything they did, for their professionalism and kindness, and also for having been top notch human beings!

Thanks again Asiana Airlines, can’t wait to fly with you again!

Kindest regards,

I didn't know much about them, but maybe due to bad marketing, for some reason had the impression they were an inferior airline.  Boy, I was WRONG.  Their customer service was great, I was able to do seat selections online (which I usually can't do with other Asian airlines - usually I have to call and request or get to the airport super early). The planes were exceptionally clean and what I think surprised me even more was that the food was amazing. They actually served bibimbap and it tasted awesome. Unlike China Easter or Southern, the air hostesses were very friendly.  I would definitely put this on par with ANA airlines if not even better.

By the way, Asiana has amazing business lounges at Incheon Airport in Korea.  Highly recommend!

The only thing i would say is this and the airline should take much better action in the future:  on my flight from Seoul to Cebu City, some dumb, loud-mouthed American guy started screaming and cursing at the top of his lungs. The cabin lights were on while the plane was taking off.  Suddenly, about three rows behind me, this American guy starts screaming at the top of his lungs """"TURN THE F'N LIGHTS OFF!!!!!!  WHY ARE THE LIGHTS ON?!?!  I'M TRYING TO SLEEP!!! FFFFF"""" - He kept doing this for about twenty minutes. People on the plane were scared out of their mind and started moving to the front part of the plane since they were scared of this passenger and his violent screaming and cursing.  If this were a flight in the USA, the plane would have landed and he would have been removed from the flight and put in jail."

I prefer everybody in business getting there food service at the same time unlike the big players were it’s dine anytime. There is always somebody clinking glasses and cutlery. The seat was comfy although a mattress would have been good. The thing letting this airline down for me is the entertainment. When you have a long flight each segment has the same videos and on the return it was again the same videos. Staff were accommodating and best of all they served Drambuie my tipple. Had a stop over in Incheon and I wish I could say it was good but the premier best western was cold and the food poor."
8.17884254455566,8.97160339355469,"Asiana Flight Review",5,"We flew a return flight in business class from London Heathrow to Sydney, Australia via Seoul on Asiana airlines.  We flew on an A350 aircraft from London to Seoul that had 28 seats in business class in a 1-2-1 configuration with all seats having aisle access.  Check in was efficient and we were invited to use the United Airlines lounge in Terminal 2 prior to departure.  The lounge provided comfortable seating and a good range of food & beverages, but was about 20 minutes walk after passing through airport security,  but close to our flight departure gate.  The service and comfort of the plane was excellent.  There was a good choice of tasty food (both Western and Korean) and a selection of fine wines and champagne, as well as soft drinks and tea/coffee.  We had a 4 hour stopover in Seoul on the outward trip and went to the Asiana lounge. The lounge had plenty of seats and offered a limited selection of food and beverages. All of our flights ran to schedule and in fact typically landed early with luggage promptly deivered at final destinations. The second leg of our outward journey was on an A380 with 64 seats on the upper deck in business class in a 1-2-1 configuration with all seats having direct aisle access.  There was a reasonable choice of movies and TV channels to watch on each sector of our return journey.  Food & beverages throughout the journey were good, with reasonable choice and excellent service. On the return journey from Sydney, we had a 19 hour connection time in Seoul. We could check our luggage in at Stdney all the way back to UK so you needed an overnight bag.  As part of our ticket, we were provided with transfers to/from an airport hotel and also provided with vouchers for the room, dinner and breakfast before being taken back to the airport at noon the next day for our onward flight to Heathrow.  The cost of two return business class tickets with Asiana airline was the same as ONE return ticket with Emirates airline.  Asiana is rated as a 5 star airline and we would cetainly recommend them and fly with them again.  They are a member of Star Alliance so you can get your air miles awards either with Asiana or another member of Star Alliance."

Since having lived in Korea for several years, we always flew Asiana Airlines after trying Korean Air and a few other American carriers. The American carriers were a nowhere near the level of service that most Asian carriers provide. Korean Air was a very good airline. But Asiana somehow just felt a lot better.

Food and drink service surpassed my expectations. Large variety and quick athletic stewards and stewardess help.
3 flight segments over with United and 3 flight segments back supposedly were seat assigned.

The first United segment was late leaving San Diego and created a time problem for the next Asiana segment to Korea. We don’t recommend San Diego to LAX Flight; better to drive than wait for delayed departures.
We ran thru LAX trying to find and then catch our Asiana flight. A map of LAX and Inchon,

Asiana airlines 24 hour Confirmation was impeded by the lack of a correct browser on our iPhone After 4 hours attempting to confirm our next day flight Using a Safari browser, I asked my frequent flyer friend in PI to help. Google Crome is the only browser that works with Asiana Airlines she found out for us. Then we had to regurgitate the birthdates, full names and Passport information already provided to ASAP tickets before we could ALMOST complete the confirmation. My brother Mark was  NOT confirmed beyond S Korea. Upon arrival there he was interrogated and triple checked for whatever then finally processed confirmed.
Returning 3 segments were much less hurried and better seats were given after my wife complained about the hassles to the Asiana rep in Manila.
SUMMARIZATIONS and RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Recommend NO to Air travel from San Diego to Los Angeles. 
2.Take terminal maps.
3. TELL your Asiana airline customers GOOGLE CROME is the ONLY BROWSER
     that works on their Confirmation system.
4. Asiana Airlines needs to coordinate better with ticketing agents IRT seat assignments 
     taken by ASAP TICKETS and NOT require regurgitation of Passenger names,

Asiana airlines has very beautiful, accommodating and friendly staff. They’re new or airplanes such as the A380-800 are very comfortable, very spacious and very quiet for the long flight. Asiana also operates the 747 which is not as luxurious as the A380.

I flew economy on a Asiana and business class.

What I like most is that easy Asiana is less expensive than some of the direct, non-stop flights that you might take on Singapore airlines or Philippine Airlines to go to Singapore or the Philippines. Unfortunately this means that you will have to stop in South Korea which will add at least two hours to your journey.

Asiana should change their color scheme because their interiors look drab and boring despite the cleanliness. They need brighter, more welcoming colors."

Selection of movies was actually pretty good! There was Hollywood, family, Korean and Asian movies and TV shows. 
The food was average. Definitely choose the western option and it's always beef (from what I've ate). They do have snacks (rice crackers, whipped cream sandwich, cookies) but you have to ask or go find them in the back.

It was a night flight, that took off with a 45min delay, at 02:30 am. The flight time is about 6 hours. The ticket was relatively expensive at around US$1000 for an economy seat. 
I was hoping to get some sleep, as I was supposed to arrive early Monday morning. The service was limited. I was offered a drink only once, perhaps because the cabin crew expected everyone to sleep anyway. 
The most disappointing of all was the legroom of the seats. I am 182cm tall, and there was no way I could sit, without having my knees press against the seat in front of me. After takeoff, the chair in front of me reclined. After that, it became impossible to sit, sleep, or do some work. The flight became an endurance test. 
I still have to fly back to Singapore later today and, I am not looking forward to that. Let's hope it is not too bad. Otherwise, it will be my last time with Asiana."

This clearly showed that they had options of givings us seats together but they wanted to MAKE MONEY by giving us seats together. Its shocking that we had one TICKET and they wanted to make money out just issuing boarding passes together. 

In the airline, their service was equally bad, per my request for a Hindu meal, the quality of the meal was EXTREMELY POOR. In snacks round they gave just a BUN and when I said, its not a eatable snack, they mentioned """"I can return it to them"""".

Asiana offers a free hotel stay in Seoul if you buy a return ticket from Sydney to Europe with them. But be warned, the process can be a nightmare. I forgot to ask in sydney about the process so perhaps I missed an information sheet. Ground staff at Incheon were not especially helpful and kept sending me to various location around the airport. I managed to rack up 2.5kms of walking!

If you have a hotel as part of your ticket, do NOT go through the transfers section of the airport. Instead go through immigration, writing ‘Asiana hotel transit’ in the address field. 
Your bag should be checked through to your final destination (check your luggage tag) so proceed with your hand luggage through customs.
Once through customs, walk left to the very far end of the terminal. You will eventually arrive at an Asiana service desk where they will hand you a voucher for a hotel.
A shuttle bus will transfer you to the hotel. I stayed at the howard johnson hotel (15minutes drive) which was very comfortable. They do give you a dinner and breakfast voucher however with all the frigging around at the airport we arrived just as the hotel dinner service was closing. We were served a big plate of fried chicken and rice when all I really felt like was a salad.
Fortunately the shower was great and the big bed was a pleasure to stretch out in.
Breakfast was a hearty affair. And the airport shuttle the next morning departed on time. (Unlike my connecting flight to Istanbul...).

I might fly Asiana again and will do the stopover now that I’ve worked out the process. Hopefully this post might prevent some weary travellers from my exhausting experience when transitting through Incheon. Asiana could have made the whole process a lot easier by having an information sheet readily available however I’m starting to think that they want people to give up and just crash out in the airport..."

I am Asiana Diamond member; I do love flying with Asiana and I fly almost 100,000 miles with Asiana and Star alliance this year. But there is one problem that Asiana has never tried to fix it. It’s about passenger’s security and privacy.

I always book business class with Asiana but I found out that my bookings have been changed several times without my permission via online and Asiana Region Office. 

The latest time I took a flight from Japan to Korea late October 2019, someone was changing my seat assignment and another passenger in the same booking as me. They changed it twice within 4 hours so I called Asiana Call Center. But unfortunately, the period that I made a call is LUNCH TIME so they cannot do anything and said that I have to call them again after lunch break. This is ridiculous as other 5 stars Airlines I have flew with never have this excuse to customer. I called them back as they had advised but the answer was the same saying they don’t know. So, I asked the operator that who made a change on my booking then they said it was Asiana Region Office. I just landed in Japan that morning and I didn’t make a call so it was very weird that Asiana Region Office changed it by themselves. My seat wasn’t priority seating and there were some seats available so why my seats were changed? At the end call center said they will check what happened and call us back but I never get the call. I decided to ask check-in counter at the Airport on departure date instead of calling call center again because if I make a call they won’t do anything.  

On departure date I was at check-in counter when the check-in counter is opened. I was asking is it possible to get my seat back? But the staff said they can do nothing. They were talking in Japanese among their staff and mentioned that I’m neither Korean nor Japanese so they didn’t even try to help but asking us to accept the situation and write complaints letter to Head Office in Korea. They kept saying that they don’t know anything but actually they’d already checked the system and they knew that my booking was changed by Haneda Center in the evening of the day before departure date. During the time I asked for explanation Asiana Staff at the Airport also said that my booking was changed by another passenger but they cannot do anything. He even told other staff to not telling any information and keep saying they don’t know. Isn’t ridiculous? Why anyone can do whatever they want with my booking easily but Asiana themselves cannot do anything? 

I am really disappointed the way they were working and handling the situation. Is this Asiana service standard? The staff treated me like I’m stupid. I talked to them in English doesn’t mean I don’t understand their language. Why they were hiding the truth? It’s not only me but all the passenger shouldn’t get any treat like this.      

Many people saying that Asiana will never react or have any feedback to any issues that passenger had complained. Now I believe it may be true because none of their staff are trying to solve the problem. Even I sent complaints letter to Asiana I still don’t get any feedback. Is this really 5-star airline? Are you always ignore passenger’s security and privacy like this? 

I hope my experience is useful for you who are reading this."
9.40800094604492,11.1677846908569,"Asiana Flight Review",2,"Firstly, English is not the first language of the flight crew or ground staff in Incheon, which made the experience worse. The inflight entertainment was poor as well, with only a few movies. Seating was cramped and pre-assigned seats for me and my travel partner for our flight back to Singapore were not together but far apart. I’ve only experienced this when booking with budget airlines, because they want you to pay to reserve a seat. Upon reaching the bag drop counter, we requested to change seats only to learn we needed to top up 50,000 won to do so. Overall a subpar experience and will not fly with asiana again."

The women at the ticket counters on both sides could not have been more accommodating.  The service on the plane was pretty uninterested both ways.  They have a tough job and there are lots of people they are serving.  But the stewardesses don't seem to care about you at all.  On the flight over, my wife was so thirsty at one point she was upset, as she could not get any of their attention.  hen she pressed the service button, she was told they would do a drink service within an hour.  We made sure to bring water on the plane on the way back, which was a less crowded and more pleasant flight.  They serve 3 meals, but the food is just ok. They have a pretty good movie selection, though the majority are poor commercial films.  Their audio can only be accessed with the old school two prong airline plug.  I'm sure it is much better in business and first class.  We were on a tour and could not upgrade our seats.  Could not pay for extra leg room or early boarding. I would only fly on this line again if I was going business class or above."

Neutral:

I caught a business class between Seoul and SF. This was the last of a string of flights, during which I flew from SF to Seoul to Delhi to Bangkok to Seoul back to SF. So, please pardon me if some details are fuzzy.

Anyhow, when I read online reviews for Asiana business class, the near total agreement is that the cabin is dab and the food is merely OK (as opposed to China Airlines, who supposedly had beautiful cabin and awesome food and service). My experience was the reverse, for both airlines cited.

First, about the cabin, I found Asiana cabin to be quite bright and nice. I don't know, maybe lack of sleep for 3 days dim my expectation?, but the color tone felt bright and happy.

The seat was excellent! I was in 6A, which was one of the window seat on the window. There was no door, but I had a giant table separating me from the aisle. Privacy was never an issue. The seat was completely lie-flat, and was very *very* comfy. I slept for about 5h straight and woke up quite rested. I can't fault the hard product in anyway.

The onboard food, again contrary to online reviews, was very good. I chose Korean for dinner and western (beef stew) for lunch. The ssambap was an interesting style of the well-trodded bimbimbap. The rolling was fun (I bet I would have had more fun if I had not been so tired), and the fermented beans gave quite a delicious edge to the food. The dessert was interesting. The beef stew was soft and flavorful, although I would have appreciated more sauces.

Drinks were good. They served me (at my request, of course) one delicious champagne, one disgusting aperitif (to be fair, all aperitif suck; I just forgot that), one strangely average scotch (they said it's Lasanta from Glenmorangie, but it tasted different from my regularly favorite scotch; maybe they had a 2nd choice that I didn't notice), one delicious rice wine, and one out-of-this-world icewine. Yes, I overdrank a bit to catch some eyeshut. Either way, as you can see, the menu was quite extensive with some good choices. After nappy (as pointed out, 5h of bliss), I asked for a cappuccino, but apparently the milk froster was out. Instead, I got an Americano instead, which was OK (not the best espresso).

I quite love the amenity kit, which was from L'Occitan, my favorite brand for hand cream. They covered all the basics: handcream, lotion, lip balm, etc. They also provided the slippers, which were sturdy and usable.

The service was lovely. The cabin manager, Kim, took her time greeting everyone. Everyone was super friendly and attentive. Lovely service, really.

The only thing I disliked was the food at the lounge. Now, the lounge was not bad. They have some nice lie-back seats, and their showers were quite good. They even provided hair gel and shaving kits there. However, the food at the lounge was really meh. This is especially glaring in ICN, whose Priority Pass lounges give excellent food.

Conclusion? One of the best flights in my life."

Maybe we just had the older planes but the seats were narrow and very unfriendly to the back. Legroom was fine. For a long haul, we found these seats to be very uncomfortable. 

Service in economy was a little strange. On the Seattle - Korea flight we were offered a small cup of water only four times, no water bottles available for purchase either. Food was okay. Staff was fine, at certain points service seemed very chaotic and rushed. Perhaps flight attendants are understaffed and overworked but they seemed to show very little interest in being helpful. First flight, there were small shrimps in multiple dishes. I’m allergic but have never encountered this issue on a flight, food options are not printed so I did not make a special request. Beware if you have a shrimp allergy. There were also some instances where we were completely skipped over during beverage service as the attendants didn’t even stop to ask us. When given meal options on one flight, I asked what the Ssambap was and received the curt reply of, “It’s Korean food.” When i asked what was in it, the attendant said “It’s made with rice” ...all unhelpful and I didn’t pursue a further exchange because it was apparent she did not care about answering my simple questions.

I flew roundtrip JFK to ICN and on both flights the crew were very courteous and attentive (response time to crew call button was about a minute). The suites with flat bed seats were spacious and I specifically like the compartments between the seat and the window as it allowed me to declutter my suite. For my in-flight meals, I chose the Korean dishes which I thought  were decent although it was my first time to eat Bibimbap and Ssambap so no point of comparison for me. I did enjoy the Shin Ramyun (ramen) snack in between meals. The wine selection was good although it was interesting when they didn’t offer champagne as pre-departure drink at JFK but did in ICN. I read somewhere that Asiana didn’t want to pay for the NYC alcohol tax. As for the inflight entertainment, the selection was limited although I rarely watch movies when flying so it didn’t matter much for me. Restrooms were clean and well stocked. The biggest surprise was being told I was only limited to one bottle of water the entire flight...the flight attendant did offer to refill my bottle.

1. I’m a star alliance member and whenever I can, I try to fly a partner. I find it just helps if there are problems along the way. 
2. I always shop for a deal on a business class flight. I find I’m way more functional after arrival going that way.
3. Never ever make a connection through China. Especially if the connection is either a code share or between alliance partners. The success rate is poor at best of making it to your destination. 
So, that brings me to Asiana. It’s one of a few routes I take regularly. Of course, you’re going to fly through Inchon no matter what. Asiana has a good selection of connections in Asia to make it a good choice. 
Business class is nice. Seats are quite comfortable, service is good, food and drinks are what you’d expect. Relatively, it’s still nicer than the new Polaris class from UA most flights. 
The airport itself is new, fresh, modern. One of the nicer terminals in Asia. The lounge is quite nice. I usually spend time taking a shower ( ask when you enter the lounge) and eating.  The only problems are.... if there’s a problem, getting to who can fix it can be a task. There are a couple of ticket desks up stairs you’ll need to find to get things fixed. Lounge level. Asking anyone in say the lounge is a waste of time, 
An issue you’ll run into depending on which connection you’re taking is a long long layover. For that, find the transit hotel. It can be hard to find online. If I’m there for more than 5-6 hours, I’ll try to book a room to sleep a bit. The transit hotel is quite nice. And you don’t have to exit the terminal. 
Asiana.... newer planes are nice. I find A380, A350, or 787 are a huge improvement in comfort and jet lag reduction. Has to do with the cabin pressurization being like 5000 ft and cabin humidity of 30%. 
This particular flight.... went off without any glitches. Boarded early, carry on luggage, nice seated and entertainment selection. Arrived a bit early. 
Overall, it’s not a bad alternative for flying Asia. Always less expensive than SingaporeAir or United. Excellent connections to smaller cities in China ( to avoid PEK or PDG). I prefer Asiana or ANA."

The aircraft was a Boeing 777-200 - a little old, with old style seat back entertainment screens. The entertainment was limited so load up your phone or take a book.
The configuration was 3 + 3 + 3.
Why it was civilized was that almost no-one pushed their seats back - My theory is that the pilot did not say ‘sit back and enjoy the flight. It made for a very pleasant flight.
Meals were served punctually - we took off at 9:30am, lunch was at 11:00, the lights were dimmed after lunch, there was a ham and cheese roll snack at 2:30 pm, and dinner at 6:00 pm.

Everything was smooth, from the orderly boarding, through the timely distribution of food, drinks, and immigration forms, to the carefully choreographed de-planing. Efficient, thoughtful, well-executed.

In-flight entertainment was limited but enjoyable. Food was far better than most airlines I've travelled in the last few years. Flight crew were available and efficient. There are better carriers across the Pacific, who manage to add a certain star quality to every step of the journey, but for the price we paid, this is as good as it gets."

The quality of attention to customer service is as bad as a low cost carrier.

Traveling in Business class I would expect an offer of at least water perhaps juice or a cocktail upon boarding, like most other air carriers around the world. NOTHING  was offered. Even the US carriers, who are no noted for poor service do a better job than this.

My years of travel and experience tell me this is a corporate culture problem. 

As I said, the staff was friendly and appeared professional so I can only deduce that the middle and upper management do not value customer service or the “first impression” on gets when flying on Asiana.

There’s a reason they number 2 and United  Airline should potentially reconsider their affiliation."

The planes were neat and clean, granted it was a new Airbus 350.  The crew was very friendly.  They all greeted the passengers in unison just right after the doors were closed.  The food was excellent.  The portion size and the flavors were fantastic.  It may not be for all as the food was Korean, but I took a chance with a new type of food and was not disappointed.  Even the greens and lettuce were actually nice and crunchy and not soggy as in many airlines.  If that airlines flew out of Houston, I will definitely consider it over United for long distance flights."

This is a bit counter-intuitive as it is exactly the wrong direction, but this was the least expensive ticket on offer, though certainly not the lowest quality of service. Kind and friendly aircrew made the experience more or less pleasant.

Check-in was noisy, sticky and pretty much chaotic. Whoever thought that electronic check in machines made life simpler for anybody. The staff looked confused, frustrated and overwhelmed. Lack of a clear queuing system meant that we, the passengers, were literally falling over each other in what felt like the survival of the fittest as we jostled for face time with a machine.

Finally getting boarding passes and handing over our suitcases (to a human being!) was a true relief. Security and immigration were also overcrowded, but not quite as chaotic as check in. We certainly had not expected this on a weekday in February.

Compared to all this, actually getting on the plane was bliss. Friendly smiles, welcoming seats, even the air felt less stale. Smooth take off landing, and the bit in between, which really didn't take long. No real entertainment, but not much needed on such a short, serviceable hop. Food, predictably, was more or less indistinguishable from the layers of plastic that it came wrapped in, but it was served so gracefully.

I have travelled this route several tines. My only issue is economy passengers entering the business cabin during the flight and availing themselves to the facilities. Especially when it is dark and people sleeping  they fumble their way through the cabin bumping into seats and walk  through two galleys with closed curtains to do so, the crew do nothing to stop them.They fiddle around with curtains and wake people uo. It is also not a good feeling when you have your belongings store where people who shouldn’t be there in the first place are hanging around.

I got neither since they actually set it up so that your legroom is a very thin walkway. Every 2-3 minutes people are crossing over my legs and kicking my things.  The pouch for storage is on the wall and people walk across my legs but to avoid me they kick the pouch and crushed my glasses.  That is when I began to ask the staff to help.  After 4 hours they could not really stop people or redirect them to the obvious crossover area (2 meters further ahead on the plane).   

I am only writing this review because I told Asiana it ruined my flight and was worse than regular economy. I only asked for the Smartium fee of $150 back and they refused to help.  Thus, I consider that money scammed and stolen from me.  

Do not use Asiana Airlines Smartium at all or you can end up with people walking all over you. The company will not protect you or care.  You will not get the benefits and it will be worse than a regular economy seat. I did not get sleep and thus my work was significantly affected.  I paid that money to improve my life, and it made it far worse.  The company owes me the money back but they refused so I am writing this review."

Like other companies, ASIANA trying to cut the cost in reducing the quality. In Business Class still ok, but not in Economy class. If not because of my Diamond Status, I would back to SIA, Emirate or Qatar which I used in the past. It happened to SIA in the past, but SIA is improving (I can judge SIA within ASIA countries).

I booked a multi cities flight from LAX to ICN then to NRT and then return to LAX with my husband. We had the same booking number and we checked in together. We asked to sit together and they said the flight is fully booked and they cannot accommodate that. What kind of bs is this? From LAX to ICN they sit us on a different floor so of course who would want to switch with us. I was on the second floor and was asked to switch because he wanted to sit next to his wife. So I was nice to agreed because I know how he felt. And it seemed that several more other people switch their seats because the airlines just cannot seat a family together. So on our way to LAX, there we go again. They sit us separately and they continue to say the flight is fully booked and they cannot switch our seats. That whole bs again. So I thought well this time at least we sit on the same floor and we can just asked others to switch. Turned out both of us got sit in the middle seats. So when we asked the aisle and window passengers to switch they said no because who wanted to sit in the middle and be sandwiched by two strangers. The flight attendant is not that nice either. They barely smile and only friendly with Korean people because this airline Is Korean. I was very frustrated by this situation and will never ever flight with this airlines again. If you fly solo go ahead because like I said this airline just cannot sit a family together on a very long flight."

A limited range of alcohol but this is sensible.  The Korean food was fun although trying to assemble leaves meat and rice in the palm of your hand during turbulence was a little challenging.

11.649471282959,9.53514099121094,"Asiana Flight Review",4,"There are 2 options from LAX to ICN. Mid day and just after midnight. One is on an A380, the other an A350. I prefer the midnight flight as it gets  you to your destination during the daytime, rather than midnight. And, makes it easier to get to sleep on the long flight. 

Checkin is a snap. I make a connection into LAX and use the kiosk as you near the international terminal. The other alternative is to use the star alliance lounge. 

Flight... make sure you get one of the seats where you are not right on the aisle, exposed to people passing by. Seats are great. Entertainment is good. Food service and selection is good, accommodating asian and western tastes. Drink selection is very good. Either plane is great. Both are pressurized to a lower altitude and allow for increased humidity, making for less jetlag. 

Arrival and connection in ICN. Its a huge airport. The connection process is pretty simple, just follow signs to go through security and back to the departure hall. The Asiana Lounge is pretty good. I typically take a shower as part of the wait. If you need help with your ticket, upstairs there's a small ticket office where they can help you. The lounge isnt so helpful. 

Onward connections are often less impressive than the long over water flights. By then, Im just ready to arrive and get to sleep. 

Asiana is often one of the cheaper, non mainland chinese choices. One good thing is their reach into china. If you need to fly to a smaller city in china, a connection in ICN is often an easier alternative than a connection in PEK or PVG."

Since my bf and I bought separate flight tickets, we couldn't checkin online 48 hours before hand, so we got to the international airport 2 hours in advance and there was already a line.  We requested if we could be seated together, but the flight was full and the assistant told us it was not possible after checking.  Suddenly he told us to wait for a bit and then arranged us to be seated in the same cabin, which was the business class.  Though the service and food was not business class, at least the hard ware was and we get to rest well through the night with reclining seats that laid flat and had sufficient leg room.  The trip inbound was regular economy class though the service was also excellent.  Food wise was just so so, like regular airline meals.  There were not many movies to choose from though."

The food selection was good: there was always a Western meal then a Korean meal & service is impeccable. Hospitality for Asiana always impressed me. 
We had L’Occitane travel amenities which had a sleeping mask, toothbrush kit, L’Occitane lip balm, hand lotion & light cream, then earplugs and facial tissues. 

From Incheon to Manila, we boarded a small Boeing 747 plane in which the first class cabin was converted to the business class premium called “business smartium”. I was not impressed by this cabin at all—it was very obvious that the 747 fleet should be grounded forever due to its old age and heavy wear/tear. Service was of course excellent but comfort was bleh. Here are some pictures of my husband & I. Third photo would be the plane from Incheon to Manila.

Reviews:

Airport services
Asiana has its own service team at the check-in point with both English and Korean languages. The lounge was offered by UA at another terminal where you have to take a train to the boarding one. Food at lounge was just-ok and personally I suggest guests to leave room for dinning on board.

Cabin Services-equipments
This A350 craft is super new and everything was coloured as Asiana tradition beige. The good side for people tall as me is the leg room. I fell asleep for more than 5hours during the cross pacific flight with no table hitting my kneels nor did I feel difficult to move within the leg room. However, there's no box-like storage space except for a magazine cabinet. 
The poor side is the seat map and entertainment system. There are two seats on the middle of the cabin with one row of a side to side seats and next row of a separate seat pair. So if you traveled with your partner please be sure to notice this difference. What's more the window side seats also distinguished as one row close to window and next row near the aisle( with your storage side near window). In terms of the entertainment, the headset is simple-designed and the movie menu was less attractive than other competitors.

Cabin services-F&B
This flight offers two meals with traditional idea of Korean cuisine. If you are not a spicy lover please just add a little gochu jang. If you are, I will recommend korean Ramen as a choice during the flight.
I would like to highly rank the cabin crew team. By knowing that both the Korean and Japanese airlines offering great services, the Korean Asiana not only gave their hospitality to me, but also surprised me by their language skills. English Japanese Korean and Chinese could be used in the cabin, amazingly."

The luggage limit was 50 lb, which was great. The plane was old, but it kept it in good shape. I had noticed the prep in the plane was not perfect: noticed the refill on papers was not neat. They were pushed and not easy to use it. I was a first user of that rest room. It looks like they miss the quality control."

The check-in process was smooth (loved the auto-check-in system they have!), and on the airport the luggage check-in was easy and quick. 

Boarding was smooth and all the staff was very nice and friendly.

The food provided in the plane was particularly good and there is a broad selection of drinks in offer.

On the way back we had an issue on the flight from Tokyo to South Korea, and after talking with the hostesses and some managers at the Seoul airport I was offered a free upgrade to premium economy as compensation, which was great considering it was going to be for the longest leg of the trip.

Flights were on time and it felt very safe. I would recommend this airline."
10.0059652328491,9.08253955841064,"Asiana Flight Review",5,"Excellent service: friendly ground crew and flight attendants, some of the FAs didn't speak great English but they were very helpful, water was brought around on a regular basis, responded to call button quickly. Food was excellent - bibimbap for lunch and spicy octopus for dinner. Wow - the octopus was so tender and flavoursome. Have to rate these amongst the best Economy meals I have ever had. Lots of drinks: beer, wine, spirits, and good quality too (eg, Chivas Regal whisky).

Plane was an old B777 but has been very well maintained, little sign of any wear and tear. Comfortable seats. Just the IFE was a bit dated (smaller screen) and not a huge range of English language movies (good but not great). They do provide movies in four languages so that is probably a factor. I watched a couple of Korean language movies (Eng subtitles), and they were very entertaining.

Toilets kept very clean the whole flight and kept stocked with excellent quality toothbrush/paste kits. Little details like the excellent quality paper towels in the toilets shows great attention to detail by Asiana. So, overall, a very enjoyable and comfortable flight in Economy."
9.40607357025146,10.1788082122803,"Asiana Flight Review",4,"Returned to Hong Kong from Los Angelas with Asiana recently and had a nice flight, very good value for money based on the very low economy class tickets we had booked 9 months before our trip. 

Check-in at LAX was quick and simple. Clearing security and immigration in the Tom Bradley terminal was smooth and expedient. Similarly, our layover at Incheon Airport in Seoul was simple and relaxing. 

Flight from LAX to Incheon (Seoul) departed and arrived on time, seats were generally comfortable and there was plenty of legroom. We slept comfortably for a handful of hours during the flight. In-flight entertainment was decent, in-flight meals were surprisingly good servings of bibimbap and a spicy chicken dinner. Overall, this was a good transatlantic flight. 

Flight from Seoul to Hong Kong similarly departed and arrived on time, was similarly comfortable with fair leg space. In-flight entertainment system was dated and probably in need of being upgraded. However, it was good enough for a 3.5 hour flight. Bibimbap served during flight was just fine. Flight was fine, what you want with a shorter international flight. Luggage arrived on the carousel in 25 minutes after arrival and we were on our way home. 

Overall, we still prefer Korean Air to Asiana for long international flights. However, this particular flight was booked a very low price compared to what other carriers were offering to Los Angelas. In this regard, the flight was just fine quality wise and very good value for money cost wise."

The Asiana aircraft interior was ancient compared to the Qantas aircraft.  The seats were ancient and n to lie-flat seats.  The screens were so pixelated you couldn't watch a movie.

Do not pay for a business flight on this route.  The only advantage is extra leg-room."

From check-in to de-planing the whole experience is excellent. The ground staff and cabin crew were smart, friendly and responsive. The plane (an A350) was very new, all of the Club Class seats face forward and are very comfortable flat beds. 
The dining is fine dining of the highest quality. Each meal is preceded by an amuse bouche, followed by an appetiser (eg smoked salmon salad), then soup (eg a chowder) and then the main course (I had a marvelous fillet steak), then cheese and biscuits and then fruit!. All accompanied by white and / or red wine and / or bubbles. The """"snack"""" at the end of the long journey would have done as the main meal on many much better known airlines.
The in seat facilities are good and comprehensive and the moving map on the A350 is a definite improvement over the 777.
Asiana sets the bar very high. I'm flying Club with BA in the next few months, it will be interesting to see if they have improved their offering to start to compete with this excellence.

Flight was booked directly through their website when excellent rates were on offer for flights to LAX, around 9 months prior to our trip. Airline communicated slights flight departure time changes sufficiently through email. Check-in at HKG airport was timely. 

Unfortunately, our flight was delayed around 3.5 hours due to lightening thunderstorms that came up in HK just as we were about to depart. Thus, we had to sit aboard the plane, at the gate for quite some time waiting to take off. Flight meal was served while we sat on the ground at HKG. That was a first for us. We finally took off and arrived at Incheon International nearly 3 hours later. 

To our fortunate, our connecting flight to LAX was also delayed 4 hours, allowing us to not miss our connection after arriving very late into Incheon from HK. That was rather lucky for us, something else we've yet to encounter before during our travels. 

Flight from Incheon to LAX was smooth, comfortable and we were able to sleep quite a few hours, allowing us to be well rested upon upon eventual arrival into LA. We found seats comfortable on both flights, plenty of leg room. Entertainment system on the first flight between HK and Incheon was dated and had bad sound quality. On the flight to LA the system was newer, better quality. Meals were decent on both flights. We enjoyed the bibimbap and the ssambap were both better than you'd expect for airline food. 

In the end, we felt this was a good all around flight. Asiana is a grade or two below Korean Airline. However, considering how low their flight prices were when we booked, this was a very good value for money and overall flight. Hopeful we'll feel the same about our return flight home in a couple of weeks."

The plane was a 777, noticeably older than the A350 and A380 which I had flown earlier but the welcome, friendliness and cleanliness of the Business cabin was at the consistently high standard encountered on the earlier flights.
The main meal, served soon after take off comprised an amuse bouche , an appetiser followed by clam chowder and then the main course of beef fillet, followed by cheese and biscuits and the fruit! Wow! Delicious, well cooked food of highest quality.
After the meal, although it was only late morning, the blinds were lowered and most passengers went to sleep.
A “snack” was served an hour and a half before landing, which most people would have considered a very good lunch! The wines were of the best quality and tea and coffee were served from elegant tea and coffee pots.
I cannot praise this airline high enough. It makes me actually look forward to my next flight with them.
My only criticism was that the moving map was very limited."

Champagne offer on boarding, I could position the seat in a good comfortable position for watching the in-flight entertainment and seat reclines to a flat bed position. I manged to get some sleep which is unusual for me. I felt the on board services was a bit rushed compared to other airlines and no real drinks service after take off, tied in with the meal service, so you need to order two drinks if you want a pre-meal drink and then wine with your meal. Also not given much time to browse the menu before asking for your choice. The food was of a high standard with both western and Asian/Korean choices.You get two services on each leg with snack selection throughout the flight.The crew were very professional and attentive. Another disappointment was limited choice of in-flight entertainment.  All in all a very comfortable two flights. Lounge in Incheon Airport which there are two were okay but have been in better, you get 4 hours transit on the way out from London To Sydney ample time  to freshen up with a nice shower in the lounge. Returning from Sydney you would need to overnight in Seoul has flights do not match up around a 18 hour layover. We took four days out a used to explore Seoul"

Also I immediately booked a new flight through them so I can update this next month when I do fly. They made a life long customer. I am not sure if this is the best airline of all time or I was given special treatment because of my situation. Although, this must happen to people all the time. The trip I was planning for a year was ripped away from me the weekend before I leave. I was devastated. Asiana really tried to work with us to change our plans but still leave the same time we were supposed to (although that fell through to, you need a permit for specific medications) long story short I had to cancel all together. They say refunds take 2-4 weeks and I needed the money to book new tickets so I was really hoping it would come in two weeks but it came in 1! They were just nothing but nice and helpful. No crazy fees or anything. I truly love this airline! I felt the really cared for me or at least about my experience with them."

I was quite impressed; their planes were rather comfortable (especially the one from Los Angeles to Seoul), their meals were good and the service was excellent. They even served us a meal on our short flight from Seoul to Tokyo.

The only downside to our experience was the fact that our seats got switched for the plane ride back to LAX. We had chosen our seats when we bought tickets and were looking forward to sitting together for the flight. But, we found out when we got our boarding passes that our seats had been changed :( I believe they likely changed the type of plane that was doing the flight and that was the cause for the switch.

I enjoyed the well-known Yeongyang Ssambap (marinated beef and rice) and the wonderful Potofu Bossam (rice wrap beef). The cabin toilet was clean. However, I would like to give some suggestion on the entertainment options. I had flown 3 times on 2018 and the movies were all the same. I wish they could provide more movies options.

However, as flights were quite expensive we decided to shop around. A call to Trailfinders led to a suggestion of using Asiana Airlines which would cost us almost half the amount of flying with Emirates. We did have to travel to Heathrow but it was certainly worth the train journey.
The first leg to Seoul saw the business class cabin half empty so service was excellent. The cabin crew were outstanding, so polite & helpful. Meals were very good with good choices of wine. The second leg to Sydney saw a full cabin, but that did not alter the high standard of the cabin crew. Nothing could be faulted.
The return trip was equally as good with another half full cabin on one leg. We had an overnight stay at Incheon in an airport hotel which was very accommodating. A meal on arrival & breakfast the following morning.
It is with reluctance that I write this as I am worried too many people will find out about this gem of an airline & prices will increase!!"
10.4854116439819,6.45699787139893,"Asian Airline Comparison",1,"I never experienced anything as the flights with Asiana on this trip despite remembering that it was some upper-class airline before this is an absolute no-go experience and an airline sure to avoid for the future.
It started all with the flight from Bangkok to Seoul (OZ 742 on 3rd March) where I tried to check in online well in advance but always got the message seating is not available and check in is only available at the airport. I was a bit concerned as I used the first time a web service (trip.com) for this standard flight as the booking wouldn’t have impact on the flight but that may have been a big mistake as discovered later. So from the start I was not able to put in any Window seat request or my special meal request as offered online. I was still good hopes and was able to get a window seat in the plane that was changed to an antique Jumbo.
Plane finally worked, and we had only 30 min delay in total but sleeping was almost impossible as it was really cold and with the 2 blankets and my Jacket I was still cold, but this didn’t really cover the fact that the fact that seats were so run down that the foot rest did not fit in and my feet were laying on the metal rack all time with a half declined seat. As there was no Vegetarian food ordered I had some salad and cheeses and that was that part.
As I had that experience I warned the agent well in advance to get a better placed but the agent was not able to put in any reservation of my Business seat as well as I wasn’t online. At least agent managed to get in a special Vegetarian Lacto Ovo request and I kept hoping. The departure time came closer so 46hours (not 48 hours) before the flight I tried online check in again with the same response – go to airport as no seats available. So, I was still hoping someone had received the request and takes care. So the day of the flight I got nervous as I worried for my window and so I called (couldn’t call earlier as when calling the line during day most is in Korean and it takes around 20min to get to somebody in English while I was working and had no time for that. So 3 hours before the flight I reached some service she took all my details so she knew me and confirmed that my VEGAN meal was booked (not as I requested) and that seats can only be assigned at the airport. To avoid any other delays, I decided for a taxi instead of the 10 times cheaper Airport limousine as that was scheduled to arrive 17:10 so that would leave me only 10min to check in with no window reserved so I took the high rate arrived at 4:30 just to learn that there was a mess due to change of airlines. The guide held me for 1 hour at the check in counter as the new seats had to be re-assigned whereas I still don’t believe that was a reason as I was the only one standing there and lots of Golf bags got checked in around me. In the meantime, the guy asked me even if I would accept to take a 2 hours later flight that I should have taken if I would have known what comes, but I had an appointment in Bangkok at midnight to receive a ring from a special jewelry shop, so I didn’t want to miss that (later of course missed that anyhow). After lot of lame excuses and many “in a moment’s” I got my window seat and proceeded already being informed that there is a 1.1-hour delay (at that time) – I proceeded and already my hopes had gone for making my meeting, but things turned bad of course. Already at the boarding there was a mess and apologies for seat changes that should have occurred long ago and here the excuse was aircraft connection (after all experience that meant waiting for 6 passengers for 2 hours from another flight). So slowly boarding and the flight attendant friendly said sorry for ONE-hour delay and I told her it’s 1.5 for sure and yes it got worse suddenly when it almost appeared as we are departing and doors were closed a new announcement came that we have to wait for 6 connecting passengers., that was at 8PM 1:40 after the original flight departure and incomprehensible even to the in-flight staff what was happening finally after a long wait then we departed at 8:45 more than 2.5 hours after the planned departure and with all explanations I was given by the staff I concluded for me that the online reservation didn’t work as the flight was overbooked and with the apps that are used by Koreans they will do their seats exactly 48 hours ahead and immediately it will stop the bookings as the seats get taken. Then with the overbooked flights on both flight going to Bangkok, changing aircrafts and waiting for the 6 from the other flight that didn’t fit into the 2nd hour later flight anymore made us wait."

The best part about this flight is that they use the A380-800.  Although the jet itself is expensive, it is the PERFECT aircraft to keep people comfortable and offers well equipped seats unlike the 747.  I specifically choose A380-800 airplanes when I fly because I need the space. 

The cabin colors are slightly more drab than Emirates - who uses the same aircraft - but the interior is still kept clean and neat. 

If you are tall or large you will want to look for the window seats without any other seat in front of them next to the emergency exit.  Easily the best seats on the jet.

As an Asian, i think they've got a pretty good legroom for me, the seat was quite comfortable as well because you can adjust your headrest to fit your needs. The aircraft was clean. Although for me personally, i think the air conditioner is not cold enough as they only have central AC (not personal adjustable ones). And the in flight entertainment to me was average as expected on international flights. 
Upon seating, they offered you pillow, blanket and headset for the in flight entertainment. You can also request for blindfold and ear plugs. As we're flying overnight, they offered toothbrush with coated toothpaste on the lavatories. 

During my flight, they offered various drink and snack for departure and breakfast around 1-2 hours before landing. The food choice was fried noodles and chicken with rice. I chose chicken with rice, and personally it tasted fine for economy class food.

As for the Asiana crews, i think they were very helpful and friendly.

Flying from Jakarta to Seoul costs approximately around 9 mill Rupiah for round trip (around 637 USD) but you can get as low as 5.5 mill Rupiah for round trip on promotional ticket (around 389 USD). I think the price was excellent though for direct flight, as they offered the cheapest fare available compared to other airlines flying from Jakarta.

All in all, i'm satisfied flying with Asiana. And in other times i'd travel to Seoul, i'd gladly choose to fly with Asiana again."

2.5 Hour delay of departure due to delay from connection flight, probably the plane coming from China.
Original arrival time in Jakarta was already late night at 10:30pm, but due to delay, arrival schedule was pushed out to 1:00am. And for my final destination it takes another 3 hour drive from Jakarta. Any delay from departure eventually screws up the entire schedule in the place like Jakarta where traffic jam is in disaster level.

The apparently best way to take care of this problem is to use a CPAP machine which pushes air down the windpipe and so that you can breath air while you sleep.
I have traveled on many airlines business class and used my CPAP machine so that I could sleep throughly.  
This trip I flew to Taipei on EVA Airlines.  I obtained permission in advance to use my CPAP machine and was able to sleep through most of the flight from LA to Taipei.  All of the personel on the telephone and during the flight were very helpful to me as is usual.
I made arrangments to fly home from Shenzhen, China on Asiana Airlines.  I called Asiana a couple of times before I left for Asia.  I requested the person on the phone to approve me for using my CPAP machine.  They told me that because the flight was arranged with another airline I couldn't get permission to use my CPAP machine until I was at the airport.  The person was very firm and wouldn't help me.
Much later when I was going home, I contacted an Asiana employee at the Business Class Lounge in Shenzhen.  She contracted me with someone on the phone from her company.  I asked the person on the phone whether I could have permission to use my CPAP machine only from the leg between Soeul to LA.  She told me that there was no problem for me to use the machine.  Later on the flight to LA I took out the machine and a flight attendent told me that I couldn't use the machine in that it might start a fire.  I ended up not being able to sleep the entire leg between Soeul and LA.
I didn't like the attitude of the Asiana employees.  They were abrupt and not helpful.  I will never fly on Asiana again."

No problem, the staff at the lounge arranged for my phone to be located and delivered to the departure gate for my flight to Sydney. Service!
The flight to Sydney was in the spacious A380 and the whole upper deck was Business Class. Once again the flight attendants’ service was exemplary. Dinner was the finest of fine dining: starter of melon, Parma ham, foie gras and salad, then a celeriac soup, followed by fillet of beef with dauphinoise potatoes and green beans, cheese and biscuits and then a choice of dessert. The wine selection was also first class.
Breakfast was excellent: eggs benedict, croissants, pain au raisin, fresh fruit and yoghurt. Coffee or tea, both served from silver coffee and tea pots. Extraordinary! I had missed breakfast on the earlier flight because the flat bed was so comfortable I had slept through it!
 Once again my only complaint was that the moving map is not very good. How you can fly down the east coast of Australia without identifying such places as Brisbane and the Gold Coast is inexplicable.

In my recent flight, however, Asiana used an overrated plane, the new A350. Was a bit excited coz the plane is one of the latest by Airbus. But got so dismayed in the whole duration of the flight. The plane's engine was so noisy and I felt that the seats are a bit smaller than those in the A380. Even if I was already using the headphone with its volume in full blast, I can still hear the noisy sound of the plane's engine for the almost 12 hours flight to LA. This plane should be used for shorter trips only.

When I got to the transfer desk in Terminal 1 of Incheon Airport, a female agent looked up my info and said exactly “The flight is full. You are on standby. You cannot board. Go talk to Delta”. 
I gave Delta a call and I received Asiana’s confirmation number. I then went to another male agent at the counter and hope he could find my confirmation. He seemed to be confused and the aforementioned lady on his side told him something in Korean with an annoyed tone. I got the same response from him as well. 
At this point I said “Look, I’m in your system and you acknowledged that. If I cannot get on to this flight could you at least rebook me or something?” The whole staff at the counter suddenly got really annoyed and they all started yelling at me, especially the woman I first talked to who at the time leaned back playing her cellphone and spoke in a whiny tone. Multiple people shouted at me at the same time but all they said was simply “You have no ticket. You are on standby. No rebooking. This is not our issue. You are with Delta. Not Asiana. ” in a disgusted manner. I did not raise my tone or spoke anything rude to them during this whole interaction and their response was far from friendly. 
There is nothing more I could move forward so I left their counter soon after feeling humiliated and puzzled. The staff certainly saw my name in the system, and Asiana did issue a confirmed ticket — Delta actually went to check thrice on their end and Delta certainty could not make up one — but how could I “have no ticket” and “be on standby” at the same time? 
In the end, I gave Delta another call and a couple minutes later I sat on an Korean Air flight to Shanghai (and I traveled to Hangzhou via CRH the same day). 
To be honest this was my first time ever encountered an oversold flight that did not even allow me to check in. This experience could not be worse because of the hostility from Aisana’s counter staff. Funny that they earned a 5 star from Stytrax with this kind of professionalism. MAYBE they have excellent in-cabin service, but I could not rate that because I could even get myself a boarding pass to board the flight I was supposed to be on."

No response to my thank you when I got my boarding pass - no answer, no smile and nor even a glance in my direction.
The second situation occurred at the time of breakfast being served two hours before arriving to New York.
I was given two meal options, yet only one meal was available at that moment and I accepted this reality. Despite my understanding of that fact, I was the last one served in my row, after the three rows in front of me where  already served and eating, and the row behind me was served even earlier.

Trash extended to the row behind me as well and was not collected until the passengers behind me brought it to the flight attendant’s attention, and this flight attendant didn’t apologize or seem to care that we had to deal with the previous passengers’ mess. Fell asleep shortly after take off, and by this time they were serving meals. I had to proactively get the crew’s attention to serve the special meal that I had preordered (Asiana’s response to my complaint was that the crew usually leaves a note reminding the passenger to ask for their meal, but they failed to do so in my case). Once I was done eating I had to wait quite a bit and ring my call button multiple times to have my tray collected, since the crew was not really walking throughout the cabin and checking on passengers. As we neared Los Angeles, I visited the restroom only to find liquid and toilet paper on the ground, and no toiletries (ie combs and toothbrushes) were available since they had not been restocked by the crew, and I even had to restock the toilet paper myself. Rest of the flight was uneventful. Food was good but nothing worth raving about, seats were definitely more comfy and spacious than economy class on most carriers, and IFE system was a joke with hardly any mainstream Western content. However I was very disappointed that I had paid a premium to fly Asiana only to receive a disgusting in flight environment and extremely underwhelming service. 

Complained to Asiana after the flight. They simply asked for “my understanding” regarding the poor meal service and garbage at my seat, and didn’t seem to acknowledge their own crew’s lack of attentiveness. When I responded, I explained that I was irritated that they neither seemed to care about my experience nor took responsibility on behalf of their crew on my flight, and asked for a small amount of compensation for the poor in flight experience. They not only denied my compensation request but also continued to allege no negligence or lack of attentiveness on their crew’s part. If anyone from Asiana is reading this, please seriously step it up in terms of your in flight experience, and acknowledge that your in flight crew seriously missed the boat. I have not had a dirtier in flight experience in terms of both the disgusting restrooms but also the unsanitary garbage I found at my seat, and I would’ve missed my meal if I hadn’t been proactive and familiar with how in flight service works.

The OZ A380 """"smartium"""" seat is packed in a bit more densely than on the OZ A350 - necessitating a bit of shifting and adjusting to make the seat configuration fit my legs (I'm 6'0"""").  It's workable - but nothing special.  (OK, it's better than United...)

Also, in OZ's configuration, the J cabin overhead bins are poorly done.  The outer bins are very short, and cannot handle even a full day-pack; that forces most of the bag traffic to the center bins - resulting in most people having to split their bags between multiple bins.  

The VGML in J were a mixed bag.  The main meal (called lunch, but really a dinner - served at ~4pm following a 2:40pm departure) was quite nice; there were some hors d'oeuvres, followed by an appetizer, salad and soup - at which point the entree was served, followed by a choice of desserts.  They kept it moving as well as could be hoped - but it was still a long meal service, and cut into my intended sleep time.  

Breakfast was the biggest negative of the flight.  Our scheduled arrival at LAX was 8:40am, but at 6am LA time the cabin lights were turned on and the breakfast service began.  This was less than 7 hours after completing dinner service, and IMO they should have waited until 7am or even 7:15am to wake people.

We had VGMLs on order - and for a sub-2 hour flight, they were EXTREMELY impressive.  (In fact, the entree was better than on the 11 hour ICN-LAX segment.)

I only am making the comparison to Korean since that is what we normally fly and it's execellent. For the value and money, Asiana is a great choice and much better than even attempting a low cost carrier. Thumbs up!"

They provide Kids meal (if we order prior to check in). And also they give some kids toy like colored penciles, sketch book and tiger masks. Even the flight time is very short (about half and an hour), they provide the simple meal and it was not that bad.
 All the attendants were very kind.
 And the seat gap is not that narrow even the airplane is not that big.
 I will use Asiana again for our next family trip."

The whole experience was fantastic, the lay flat beds enabled my husband who is 6ft to lay down, the only drawback was that he has quite big feet & the area tapers at the end not allowing both feet to be upright at the same time. The quality of the service, food & comfort was very high. It made the 11 hour trip fly by (excuse the pun) I would highly recommend this airline."

Although I was only in economy class, I still found a note from  the crew to let them know when I want to have food served (I was sleeping and didn't wake up for the food being served). And they were so polite and kind. Also the food was tasty. I am not a fan of airline meals but this one was exceptionally tasty. Really enjoyed flying the them.

First time was 2 years ago, round trip from LAX to Guangzhou. Flight was delayed in LAX for 3 hours, so it missed the flight from Inchon. So I had to wait in the airport from 9am to 5pm to wait for another flight provided by another company. On the way home, they said the flight would be delayed for around 7 hours in Guangzhou, so it would need to sleep overnight in Korea then catch next flight to LAX. But Asiana managed to find another flight from another company for me. (It was very nice for Asiana in that regard)

Second time was end of last year. Round trip from LAX to Hong Kong. Delay in LAX for 1 hour, too a big deal. But got another 4 hours delay in Inchon. The flight from Hong Kong to LAX was not bad, just around 1 hour delay in Inchon. 

Overall, it seems Asiana has some operation issue, 3 out of 4 times had quite some delay."

I've had their Western meal -- the steak -- for about 3-4 times on different occasions. Quality was consistently very good. Entertainment was limited and the selection leaves much to be desired. The seats, while comfortable, are quite dated. There are some scribblings on some of them. Overall, a good experience."

11.9336557388306,8.36935997009277,"Asian Airline Comparison",4,"We normally use Middle East carriers to travel from the UK to the Philippines, breaking the journey up into comfortable legs. At Christmas, however, the ticket prices treble. Booking ten months ahead, I got a bargain with Asiana at £560 each, albeit with long layovers. (The same tickets peaked at £1600 each later in the year). 

I booked through Expedia. Just a few clicks and I had confirmed tickets delivered. I decided much later to upgrade to 'Smartium' for the last leg of the return journey and that was done by a quick phone call to Asiana, London. No hold, no problems. 

The check in process at LHR Terminal 2 was horrible; long queues and frayed tempers, in spite of previously checking in on line, but that's nothing to do with Asiana. 

Asiana do not board by row number but, strangely, boarding was completed very quickly on all legs - quicker than most other flights I have taken, without punch-ups or screaming. There was plenty of room for hand baggage, perhaps because Asiana enforce their limits strictly.

The LHR-ICN legs were on A350s, new, very quiet, comfortable aircraft. Seats were fine with ample legroom. The ICN-CRK legs were on A321s. Nothing special but still adequate legroom for a short flight. 

The IFE equipment on the A350 was top-notch. At first sight, he content appeared limited but there was more than enough choice to occupy the 11+ hour long legs. A321 has small screens but they're OK for a short hop.
 
What Asiana did well. The service was polite and efficient throughout. The food was very good, with the Korean options excellent and authentic. Toilets were clean and stocked throughout the flight. The slippers are a nice touch; better than bare feet. Our seat reservations were honoured on every leg. Every flight left and arrived on time.

Things they could do better. Drinks were brought through the cabin fairly regularly but the attendants rushed through the cabin and you needed to be quick to catch their eye. They did not take advantage of the advanced lighting on the A350. No nice transitions or mood lighting, just on or off. The cabin on the LHR-ICN leg was very hot, but I had expected that from other reviews.

I upgraded to Smartium for the final leg back to London because it gave us access to the business lounge at Incheon for our eight hour layover. It was definitely worth the £100 each. The lounge is simple but spacious and quiet. There was a variety of food on offer throughout the day and we felt secure to nap and snack. The time passed quickly. Priority boarding felt good, though it didn't make a huge difference. The extra legroom was generous and welcome on the longest flight of the trip. 

Arrival at Heathrow was disappointing, apart from the 'go around', which was rather exciting! Just waiting for the bump then suddenly climbing like a rocket. (Drones, we were told). We were through passport control in seconds, thanks to the automated gates. Fantastic! Unfortunately, the new baggage carousels are small and 'smart'. Once they fill up, no more baggage can go on until some comes off. And guess what; most of that baggage belonged to foreigners, still waiting at passport control. It was the best part of an hour before we could claim our bags. Terminal 2 definitely has issues.

Overall, I was very satisfied with Asiana. I got a bargain with my tickets but they are not always the cheapest airline. I would not hesitate to fly with them again if the schedule and price fit my needs."

8.99724006652832,7.33286094665527,"Airline Seating Review",3,"We took a flight from Incheon Airport. Previously, we were already shocked that that was no personal inflight entertainment provided by the same airline during the first leg of the trip. I understand if it is a budget flight, but a full carrier like Asiana...and on top of that, it was a 6-hour flight.

I guess the flight to Singapore had a minority of non-Koreans, and most staff were pretty reluctant to speak English. They had previously labelled the seats to identify who are the non-Korean speakers, and the service delivered was quite different. The air stewardesses were exceptionally friendly to the Korean passengers ahead but became a little cold when they reached our row. The one in-charge of serving food seemed jaded and unhappy. She gave us an impression that she wanted to get past us as soon as she could. We never did anything unruly or impolite nor were we obnoxiously noisy - it could be our presence as non-Koreans that turned her off. It could also be because she was awkward with speaking English. Then perhaps ask if we could speak Korean instead?

I think customer service works in both directions. If you want to be treated nicely, treat people nicely.  That was why I spoke in survival Korean to let her know that I understood what she said in Korean. Well, the service never improved (obviously it was not about the communication breakdown) but at least I got what I ordered.

There was inflight entertainment on the flight departing from Incheon. The selection of films was not fantastic, but I was glad that there were Korean variety shows to keep myself entertained.

The service Asiana Airlines was sufficient. It does not provide excellence, nor does it strive to go the extra mile. It provides the basic necessities such as toilets, overhead compartments and reclining seats. 

I will choose Asiana Airlines only if it is the only airline that has seat availabilty on the dates I am flying."

No shock they changed my Fiancee's seat and mine so we were not even close to one another. Not only were we 4 rows away from each other, we were booked in the center row on a non packed flight (cause we all know center row is super fun to sit in). Once again called them and changed them.

When I checked-in online, I found that only 1 of our 4 vegetarian meals were registered in the system.  If I had selected meals for one family member, I would have done so for all.  On the day of the flight, I called the international helpline to attempt to rectify the situation, was put on hold for 27mins, before getting through to an agent who said he couldn't help me, and that I had to call the local office which would only open at 3pm that same day (my flight was 11pm).  I called the local office at 3pm, and was told that meal selections had to be made 48hrs in advance.  Thankfully, the agent said she would try her best to contact the catering kitchen.  Good news was that when we eventually arrived to check in our baggage, the check-in agent confirmed that our oriental vegetarian meals were in order for both the departure and return flights.  Thumbs up for their ability to resolve the problem; thumbs down for the reservations system creating the problem in the first place, and long hold-times for the international reservations line that was useless anyway.

In flight - service was great and meals were palatable.  Business Class seats can be extended flat, but not full 180 degrees lie flat - there was still a slight incline. This was a minus for me.  But the biggest minus is the very limited entertainment selection, even in Biz class.  Asiana has possibly the fewest movies and TV shows in their entertainment system that I've encountered in full-service carriers.  On the bright side, I got more sleep!"

We took his professional opinion and sturdy foot brace. In fact it would have been better not to fly but one does not realise all the logistics before the experience.
People at large recognise that they can help in little ways that make life much easier.. little things like holdiong a door open for a wheel chair are really helpful. I am left doubting that Asiana staff we encountered would extend such a basic common courtesy!
Here is what happened in brief.
1. I checked in online early to select seats with extra legroom. on arriving at the airport our seats had been allocated to others and we had to argue to get them back.
2. after take off the altitude caused swelling and great pain to the ankle. As the economy cabin was full we put the leg up on some carry on luggage. It did not block an aisle or exit. The flight attendant swifty moved in with stern objection. if its against the rules then fine.. but what is the alternative? No alternative was offered even though I could think of plenty myself.. including paying for an upgrade to business class where she could raise her leg as there was plenty of space there. The Flight attendants claimed this was not possible after take off. Those seats should remain empty and my wife should suffer the pain until landing. Of course this was not an option, or necessary so we ignored this suggestion much to the frustration and aggression of the cabin crew. Even the flight attendant manager saw no alternative!! Having walked top the bathroom I spotted an empty seat, the kind and patient gentleman besides us agreed to move there.. we all thought it best not to involve the cabin crew as the had proven most incompetent so far.
We spent the remainder of the flight with her leg raised on my lap. 
I believe the flight conditions made her condition worse. The cabin crew chose not to help and in-fact made matters worse. They did not use their power to present solution, simply used it to in-force rules that were of questionable importance given the circumstances. I wrote a letter once we got home requesting protocol on such scenario and expressing my experience. I have yet to receive a reply.. its been almost 8 months. 
I have been a loyal customer of Asiana for many years but have never had opportunity to test there customer service. Unfortunately they have proven to be lacking and let me down when I needed thee help the most. I have lots of milage.. and yes I will use that but There are other airlines I can travel with and I will be selecting the alternatives from now on."

The air conditioning on the plane had gotten turned off (understandable since we were at a standstill for a while, no need to have the engines running and using fuel) but it seemed that it never got turned back on, or at least never got back to its full capacity.

Now on the 1.5 hour flight from Kansai to Incheon, they served a hot meal! It was curry on rice with bulgolgi with a bread roll. On a 1.5 hour flight??? Amazing. Then on the flight from Incheon to Honolulu, they served two big meals, for dinner I selected the Korean menu and for breakfast, they served a big platter of omelet, two sausages, steamed broccoli, french fries, together with a bread roll, yogurt, and a big plastic tray of fresh fruit: pineapple, honeydew melon, and grapes - big chunks.

In addition, the plane on the flight to Hawaii had really roomy seats without your legroom blocked, it seems all the seats were Economy Plus size. I believe Asiana choose a plane like this on purpose for long international flights.

This flight is frequently late in departing due to aircraft congestion at INC, but Asiana keeps you well informed about possible delays.  On this particular journey on November 9th, we had stayed in Seoul for four days and it was even more convenient because if you are in Seoul and will take the AirEx express train to INC airport from Seoul Station (no stops... 45 minutes... 2 X 2 seating with assigned seat numbers and baggage racks for bag storage, if you still have bags).

At Level B2 in Seoul Station, if you are traveling on Asiana, Korean, or Air Asia  there is an airline checkin counter where you can check in for your flight, check in your bags, clear immigration, and buy your AirEx Train Ticket with your choice of departure time (W 9,000).

Then you can either come back later (having rid yourself of your checkin bags) or remain there in a lounge until you are ready to board the train. When you arrive a INC Airport you can go directly to an expedited lane for the Security Check and go to your gate. Super Convenient!"

The aircraft was somewhat disappointing; as the European competitor of the Boing 787, the 350 is noisier and has smaller windows. Other features may differ from one company to another. Asiana had a good ticket price - less than USD 1,000 from SFO to Hanoi, Vietnam, round trip. On economy, seats configuration are 3-3-3. Leg room was more than enough for my 5'5 height. Seat reclining was comfortable and the screen size adequate - smaller than an iPad, though. By the way, IFE was less than good. Not many new blockbusters. It seems the company follow the Asian traveler preferences. Blanket, headset, and a pair of slippers were distributed for all passengers on Economy and toothpaste/brush were available at the lavatory. Meals were good, specially the Korean option (they had one Korean and one western choice). I had the ssambap - quite tasty. Liquor was served at no additional cost for passengers.

The economy seats are small and uncomfortable, (I flew Korean Air economy and my experience was exponentially better, but that’s another review). The restrooms were unclean, and the floors were soiled. The in-flight food was awful as well, we weren’t even offered a bottle of water for a 10+ hour flight. The final cherry on top upon arriving in Los Angeles was broken luggage! When I filed a claim they tried to offer me very cheap, very poorly made luggage as a consolation.

What costs Asiana marks here is their poor excuse for a business class lounge. It was jammed to the point that once I finally found a seat I was unwilling to get up again for fear of losing it. Food and drink selection was poor and the bathrooms were a mess. I was glad to have been using points, as this sort of shabby corner-cutting would have driven me nuts had I paid full fare. It was almost as bad as a US airport “business class” lounge. The whole concept of the lounge being a seamless and equal part of the same experience as one gets on board seems to have eluded Asiana’s Incheon management. Asiana should  consider bringing in an outside consultant group to show them what they are doing wrong."
10.146746635437,7.73407649993896,"Asiana Flight Review",4,"Having had a mediocre experience on Asiana’s business class last year, I was reluctant to try them again, but figured that the opportunity to fly First Class for the same number of points as business class would be worth giving it a go. The experience was generally good. 

The lounge at LAX was comfortable, with a waited dining service (limited but respectable menu). The boarding process was a bit disorderly, with the business, Star Alliance Gold and First class lineup long enough that it stretched across the terminal (but that’s mainly LAX’s fault). 

On board the suites were nice and reasonably private, though it would be nice if more airlines would adopt the Air France model and use curtains to achieve full privacy. The bedding was comfortable and the meals and drinks were good, though not spectacular. The staff were reasonably attentive without being too intrusive. Pyjamas were good enough to keep and look like they will be fairly durable. Vanity kit had some nice Salvatore Ferragamo products. 

Only two real  complaints. First was that the cabin was kept uncomfortably warm, which I’ve experienced on Asian airlines before. It kind of defeats the purpose of providing nice pyjamas and a duvet when the cabin is a toasty 25 C or warmer. Second was that Asiana still discriminates against passengers who have used points to purchase their tickets on other Star Alliance websites, by making it impossible to choose seats using the online service. Star Alliance needs to fix this across the network, either with an integrated fusion service or requiring individual airlines to provide a fix. The latter could be as simple as having a dude sitting at a terminal manually completing such requests. 

All that said, the flight was very pleasant and left me quite refreshed."

I did not argue but my face called out unhappy. The supervisor at LAX on Nov26 noticed it and approached the staff even when I didnt ask and was already walking away.. I heard him ask what happened, but I no longer bothered. I went to shop a bit and when I got to the business lounge, I was surprised that a new boarding pass had been issued to me with the seat I wanted. The staff explained how it was changed due to change of aircraft but was able to make arrangements! This was done even withput any escalation or interactiom with the supervisor. That man is a gem!

When I inquired why I have not received the digital voucher, Asiana US Marketing told me it was voided because it says in the instructions the voucher cannot be duplicated. I asked them to send me another one but they refused due to policy. I told them I forwarded the voucher email because I thought my husband can use the same link to request his digital voucher. Had they sent the email regarding the voucher to my husband in the first place, I would not have gotten my voucher voided.

I'd wrap the beef and rice on the leaf and since they were different kinds of leaves, every bite was different. I really enjoyed it.

The lounge at JFK was with Swiss Air Star Alliance so it was small with a few snacks and drinks.  However at Incheon the lounge was great, excellent selection of food and drinks, showers and restrooms. Boarding the plane was very organized - everyone lined up by section and it was the most orderly and efficient one I have experienced.  On board, there was lots of room for your carry on bags included a seat compartment (by the window).  I chose the A seat by the window as it was a single so I had some privacy.  The crewed bowed as we pulled out of the gate on time. They took your food order early and paid attention to details - we dined as if in a restaurant with several courses, drinks topped up in between courses, water glass filled. You have a choice of Korean or Western and the quality was good.   Lots of recent movies to choose from so I watched 5 movies going (as I cannot sleep on planes).  The bathroom was clean with lots of room and amenities and they cleaned up and restocked during the flight.  I found the service to be very good and thorough.  I would fly with this airline again and recommend to my friends. I felt it was worth what I paid for the ticket."

The entire flight during that time and the recent flight this month were all excellent flights. I am not sure if I made a review about this airline before though. 
     I said this is an alternative airline to ride in, to Korean Air. I always ride in Korean Air, but in the event that the said airline does not have a schedule to fly on the day of my flight, I would opt for Asiana Airlines. 
     The service and food were great, although the console for the entertainment screen may need some additional improvements like instructions on how to use it, in English. I had a somewhat difficult time figuring out how it works the entire flight."

The tickets we got from them were not the cheapest that we can find but it was certainly reasonable. I regularly fly with Asiana and have had the chance to fly to the US from Manila three times already. I also had the chance to fly to Korea twice with Asiana and all these experiences have been altogether pleasant. Our last trip earlier this year was no exception. The service was top notch as usual, there was a restless child (the perfect gauge when trying to figure out the capability of the crew to address a passenger situation) which they were able to successfully pacify while still providing warm service to the family of the child. Food was not hotel grade but the tiny details about the ingredients (i.e. Gochujang,etc.) that you put into you bowl is really a nice touch. Seats are adequately comfortable and in-flight entertainment is updated regularly, having some Korean movies that I can watch nowhere else was a welcome addition to the usual Hollywood options. I think the flight has an option for you to purchase Wifi but I didn't feel the need to as the media selection being offered in-flight was good enough. Excellent experience overall and have yet to be let down by this airline. Keep it up!"

There were a number of shortfalls, though. The cabin was much too warm to sleep comfortably. The lay flat seats had very little padding. Bring your own pillow. Asiana's are flat and hard. No Wi-Fi. Apparently only their new A350s have Wi-Fi. Understanding the announcements was a real challenge. Finally, the in flight entertainment system is a relic. The screen quality was like a 1950's TV with rabbit ears with the broadcast station 50 miles away. Horrible! Bring your own entertainment. Trust me on this!

For the flight back from Seattle to Bangkok I had  to buy a neck pillow ( which I hate and which I think look stupid)  just to keep my neck in a comfortable position while sitting in the  seat.    In addition to the uncomfortable seat,  find it very annoying to have to sit through mandatory videos at the beginning and the end of every flight  and which override and interrupt whatever movie you are watching.  At the beginning we  are forced to watch duty-free sales advertisements,  and at the end of the flight we are forced to watch stretching exercises ( which, looking around the plane, about one person in 100 actually participate in).  Thirdly  on the BKK-ICN leg,  there  is a much much smaller  movie selection than on the ICN-SEA leg,   despite that it's a huge new double-decker plane.   That really seems counterintuitive-- you would think the newer planes would have at least as many if not more movies to choose from,  as opposed to a dramatic reduction in choices.  Lastly,  with so many people in economy class one would hope there would be staff responsible for keeping the restrooms clean, but they got dirty almost immediately and stayed dirty during the entire flight.

Flight attendants were also helpful with the baby. They took our little one when we needed a break to eat, and were also helpful in staggering our meals so one parent was eating at a time. 
Check in was also great as we felt prioritized in one important way: Asiana also has 'honeymoon' seats -- that is, business class that are right next to each other, so that when both chairs are flat, it can almost make a full sized single bed. This made sleeping with the baby a little easier."

Everything was nice on the way to Rome - however, on the way back to Tokyo, there was a big delay from Rome, which made me miss my original flight from Seoul. I was supposed to reach Narita at 6 pm, but instead, I reached Narita at around 10 pm, which made me miss the last bus to my city. So, I had to go to Tokyo once (I was lucky I could catch the *last* Narita express to Tokyo station) and from there, I had to take a bus to my place. I am glad they could find me a seat on a plane to Narita (from Seoul), however, the delay sucked a lot of energy and money out of me!!!"

Though I informed them of the pet accident caused by United Airline in March 2018 and United Ailine's action taken after the accident.

We were halfway into our flight from Fukuoka, Japan to Seoul (where we were supposed to transfer to our flight to London) when we were informed there was a problem with the landing gear and therefore we were returning to Fukuoka (why we didn't just continue to Seoul, I don't know). Upon arrival back at Fukuoka, we were given no updates or information, had to sit on the plane for an hour, before being told the flight was cancelled and to get off the plane. We went back into the departure lounge where chaos ensued! No information, explanation or advice - nothing! No sign of anyone with authority or control, they all quickly disappeared and left their poor groundstaff to deal with all the increasingly angry and frustrated passengers. Finally at 9:30pm (10 hours after the original departure) we were put on another plane to Seoul. Only once we arrived in Seoul were we told that we would be put in a hotel overnight and then put on a BA flight to London the following day, meaning we arrived in London 20 hours later than planned. As a result, this meant we missed one night's accommodation in London and theatre tickets for the following day also went unused. After returning home I asked for compensation but, when they finally replied, this was turned down by Asiana, all I received was a standard issue apology and request for understanding of the situation. Have never experienced anything close to this in 30 years of taking long haul flights, would never use this shambles of an airline ever again and strongly advise anyone thinking of doing so to look at alternative options!"

Flight attendants are ready to help with smile and fluently speaking english so no need to worry if you don't speak Korean. While flying, passengers would see one or two attendant walking along the aisle (as if they're on rotation in case anyone needs aid). The only issue I had is the couch because it hurt my back hence I sufferably slept on board and managed to sleep when arrived in the hotel. Overall the service is satisfying and I left the plane with smile and being happy.

My first flight with them was from Seoul to Jeju and my group of 4 missed our flight because we read the time as standard time but it was written in military time. I called the airlines and waited about 15 minutes before a live operator assisted and she was trying to help us on another flight. She was really calm and attempted to be helpful but ended up telling us that we would have to pay a fee for missing and would hold our spot for the next flight until we go to the airport. We arrived at the airport and the counter lady did her magic for about 10 minutes on the computer and then said they were not going to charge us any additional fees and booked us on the earliest flight and we all got to sit next to each other too. The airplane was spacious and the attendants were very poise and polite. They handed out coloring books to all the kids to keep them occupied and handed out a meal on a 1 hour and 40 minute flight which was new to me (the food was great by the way). Our second flight was when we came back home from vacation and it got delayed after our first transfer. We waited at the transfer counter for Asiana and while I was watching all the people infront of me get help I noticed all the employees remained calm which was already a plus for me since I've experienced hell with American Airlines and Spirit Airlines with delays and cancellations. When it was our turn the lady who helped us was working extremely fast trying to find us the fastest and similar route for us. She printed each one of us copies of everything and made sure all our questions were answered. She had a smile on her face the whole time and gave us food vouchers for a 5 hour delay which I thought was unnecessary since it was still in the middle of the day. The only issue I had was the food coming back to the U.S. sucked but thats just a personal preference. I would definitely fly with them again."

First, lets start with boarding process.  We were business class and I think this aircraft should have about 30 business seats.  When the airline stated to boarding, the business line was about over 100 people.  I can not believe my eyes but the local staffs were ok to process all of them.  We just waited to be the last one to get in.

The cabin was clean, the flight attendants were very nice and polite. Their service was great but the food were just OK.  The food was not bad but not great too. I would said Japan airline has best food.  If you compare to US airline, Asiana food was actually good.

The business chair can lie flat or half. The business seat has a big screen TV set but with very limited movies or TV choices.  Our fly from SFO to ICN and ICN back to SFO was exactly same channels.

The business lounge: in SFO, Asian airline customer can use UA's business lounge.  It was nice.  In Seoul, their lounge was full of people. We could not find any seat to seat and some of area was not clean.... you can request a shower room but the wait time was long.

Overall, If you take their newer aircraft, the fly is good.  We took Asiana Fly from ICN to TPE, the aircraft was a grandpa 747.  The inside chair was so very very old...I hope Asiana can replace it soon.  Our fly from TPE to ICN was B77L, the inside was new.  It was a lot better....

The new fleet of Airbus planes were much quieter than I've ever experienced!  With the addition of a low fare - this flight made a lot of sense!  
However - do your homework and preparations before the flight!
The flight leaves SFO around midnight and arrives in Seoul before 4 am!  While public bus/train services into the city don't start for another couple of hours!  So prepare to WAIT!  Public transportation into Seoul is extremely convenient but once arrived - dependent on your accommodation arrangements - normal check-in times for hotels will require you to wait for another 5-6 hours!

After all the eningeers who worked on it, they decided to give up on repairing the non-operational door.  Plus, I told them it was okay with the door issue and it did not make sense to delay the flight, because of this issue.  The purser was nice enough to stop by and told me that I could use the Row 3 aisle seats for sleeping, which I did and took seat 3F.

The hard product looks a little bit old, since the A380 is about 10 years old now.  The pajamas were good and the amenity kits was good, but I wished the zipper was not broken when I first opened it.  The TV screen was great.

You get a choice of Korean or Western meals... Pick the Korean, it's a bit better than the Western. If you have a food requirement, wow... My wife has Celiac disease and requires a gluten free menu. Her meals were really good! Huge portions of steak, chicken, etc. I still can't get myself to tell them I'm also gluten intolerant just to get the better meals!

The economy seats aren't bad, they're a little thin, but with decent legroom and decent width. I usually bring a seat cushion on these flights. I also try to book the upper deck of the A380 aircraft. They have 2 abreast seating on the outboard rows of seats, unlike the 3 abreast in the lower deck. The window seats have a compartment where you can store things like laptops and small bags. The compartment can also double as an arm rest.

Flying economy, you get about 7500 points on the flights from LAX to MNL. Compared to JAL, that's generous. I get less than 2,000 points from JAL for the same departure/arrival combination."

They told us that the only way to correct it was to cancel the ticket and re-issue us a new one at the new higher price.   When I complained, they were unable to fix it in their computer system and told us that we would have to check in early because they would need to work on it at the ticket counter and that their might be issues going through security because of the name on the ticket not quite matching up with her passport.  Nothing like embarking on an international flight knowing that there were going to be issues every time you went through security.
The in-flight service was fairly good. There was a good selection of movies and games and the flight attendents were very nice.  I would recommend that they serve beverages more often.  They came around with coffee several times, but only offered water or other drinks with the meals.  My kids don't drink coffee!  Also, they offered you a choice of one of two meals, but sitting next to the window along with the difference in languages, I couldn't understand what they were saying.  It would have been nice if they had a sign or something stating what the options were.  
The other complaint I have is that they need to put their name in bigger letters at the ticket counters, especially in Manila.  Nothing like being in a very big crowded room and trying to figure out which ticket counter you need to go to based upon their logo which looked like everybody elses logo.  Their name in big bold letters would have saved me several minutes as well as having to fight through several lines of crowds trying to find them."

Friend B was getting oddly with the speech of the ground staff and telling her that we were going to take Asiana Airlines but Air Seoul or Air Busan which are low-cost or budget airlines that subsidiary of Asiana Airlines.

The ground staff understood the feeling of Passenger B and seek for assist with her supervisor but the supervisor replied us the same with very cool attitude.  The supervisor even asking us could we speak in English but Passenger B and Passenger C was asking with simple English with the ground staff and the supervisor when starting the conversation.  The supervisor was not using her heart to listen and provide service to her customers as passages C questioned back to the supervisor: “Aren’t we speaking in English, why you triple asking us that ‘can you speak in English?’ for times”.  The supervisor was black-faced as not saying anything and helpless.  We all disappointed as we not believe we were providing service by Asiana Airlines with those tones or attitudes.

As we do not know much about the check-in process with the kiosk as well as there is nil staff assisting, all the boarding pass was just notification pass except passenger C as he scanned the passport with the kiosk.  By the same time, we really cannot feel that the honor of the World’s best service airports since 2005 as the notification signs under Asiana Airlines were putting around on the floor of the airport and the ground staffs of Asiana Airlines were not helpful.  

The ground staff at the counter waved her hand with a little bit of smile and we approached the counter and check-in with her.  She got all our passports and the ‘notification pass’ and the boarding pass of passenger C.  She let us knowing that the flight was being delayed for another an hour till 21:40 (GMT+9) after she made her professional skills of the check-in process with the computer when we started receiving the passports and the boarding passes.  The boarding time were printed as “21:10” but the boarding time of the boarding pass was printed as “20:10” with passenger C's.  She explained that was correct and no error for all.  All of us except passenger D was wondering that why our flight was being delayed again.  She informed to us that there was an air traffic control in China and passenger C claimed that the flight should not have any air traffic control affect with Republic of China.  “No! not your ‘China’, and I do not know much.” angry replied by her.  In here, we cannot feel that she is kind and she seems having discrimination based on the nationality of passenger C, Taiwanese / the Republic of China, or travel document(s) that he hosts as she required passenger C to show his Hong Kong Identity Card but passenger C is not a resident of Hong Kong as fact.

She started to making another story that claiming Asiana Airlines sent us one delay notification/alert email in the morning already with her fully confidence but there were no results were found with our mailbox with showing to her by passenger C after we questioned her why there was nil notification like our inbound flight to Incheon or Korea Republic.  The staff was black-faced and double confirmed the email and telephone number with passenger C correctly.  Finally, she claimed that there would be system error that led we could not receive any related notification or alert but without any apology.  We all get angry and passenger A was asking any complimentary for her fault and wrong information was being given.  She refused with straightly and claimed that could not upgrade to another category due to all the seats were going to be occupied with the flight OZ745/AAR745.  On the other hand, passenger C received notification email at 19:21 (GMT+9) about the flight delay which we left the counter J around 15 minutes.

In addition, the ground staff was working and serving strict forward with the standard operating procedures that nothing with flexible.  Seoul was cats and dogs during our journey and we got umbrellas as souvenirs with the hotel that a kind of memory of the trip.  Therefore, two umbrellas were lost in the Hong Kong International Airport due to the staff refused the umbrellas as checked luggages.

We were on time arrived to the gate 50 for boarding to the flight but it was another delay as queuing for long time.  And we were noticed to queue at another side of the gate after queueing for 10 minutes.  All of us and other parties with the same flight were getting angry due to the staffs were getting wrong direction for queue and the flight was arranging confusion.

One of the crew staff at the entrance of the aircraft was shouting to us one by one with “Show me your boarding pass!  I need to check you take the correct flight or not!”  but our passports and boarding pass were being double checked before landing to the aircraft at the gate 50.  The crew was so rude with oddly voices and tone.  In addition, two of the ground staff at the gate 50 were no smile and seems working like slaves that not welcome us to take the flight to Hong Kong.

The flight was not going to depart Incheon as passenger C noticed the crew staffs were starting to ask passengers would like to have some water or drinks.  passenger C asked crew A, the crew staff whose name tag with five-star red flag were printed on it, when would the flight would be departed.  Crew A believed that we only can speak and listen in Mandarin/Chinese and thus saying that the captain of the flight announced the flight would delay another 40 minutes in Korean and English in early minutes and pointing us could not listen that but we all did not hear any related announcement by the captain.  Crew A extended her story saying that the there is a sudden or temporary air traffic control by the aviation traffic  control room by the Incheon International Airport and would seek for the captain to announce when would the flight could take off.  In addition, she explained that there was air traffic control with Shanghai and Peking since the aircraft was depart from Shanghai (she could not mention which airport of Shanghai as Shanghai having two airports which are Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport (SHA) and Shanghai Pudong International Airport (PVG).) to Incheon before this flight itinerary, from Incheon to Hong Kong.  However, we found that the aircraft HL7741 was take off from Shanghai Pudong International Airport (PVG) under OZ366/AAR366 with delay 85 minutes compare with the schedule when we track back related record through website days later.  In addition, the flight was nothing delay related to the air defense identification zone with Shanghai or Peking as we checked with websites.   

Therefore, crew A said that the captains were going to rearrange in current for the flight route again as it would be pass by the air defense identification zone of Peking and Shanghai at that moment which needs the delay for 40 minutes more.  Passenger C was wondering that captains should arrange the flight route before they enter into the cockpit and the flight should not pass by the air defense identification zone within mainland China due to the flight normally directly to Hong Kong after pass through the air defense identification zone of Korea (Korea Republic), Japan and Taiwan (Republic of China) rather than pass by Peking and Shanghai.  Crew A immediately claimed would ask for the update information and share with us after asking with the captain but no response.  Passenger A got angry that why crew A would share those unconfirmed information to us and making stories.  

Crew A may think about her fault, thus she offered us to choose the meal with chicken or seafood due to the shortage with the meals when we were waiting for the flight to take off.  We all choose with chicken as our decision made since Passenger B is allergy with some seafood such as shrimp.  Crew A dropped down our selection with a memo pad afterwards as eyewitness by Passenger A and Passenger D.  When the dining car arrived to our side, one of the Korean crew staff B asked we would like to have chicken or fish.  We all ordered for chicken again and she delivered.  By the same time, crew staff A with the dining car with that Korean crew staff B but crew staff A did not noticed that we made the request with her.  We all disappointed as the meals with fish rather than chicken.  Passenger A wanted to complain that but Passenger B claimed that was fine as he is not allergy with fish.  This can proved that crew staff A did not listen the words and out of promise to her customers.  In addition, there was no communication between the crew staffs.  On the other hands, a Korean workmate shared to Passenger C that his flight was being delayed due to the meal cannot be deliver to the flight on time as this is the actual reason for delay since there was a giant accident for the main kitchen of the aircraft dining.

The whole journey was not service airlines and it can be described as the worst airline in the world.  In addition, the service by the budget airlines are much more better than this Korean brand airlines.  We complained the case to the Asiana Airlines, but they did not reply for more than one month till today"

To make matters worse, they answered my formal complaint email with a simple apology, with no comments on reembersment, and they have still not responded to 2 additional emails.

A schedule change made our 2 hour layover into a 10 hour layover and Asiana gave us all free city tours of downtown Seoul. It was great. On the return there was another schedule change resulting in a very long layover and Asiana gave us a free hotel night with food voucher.

I politely asked, """"Well, what exactly is your job?""""  Aren't you supposed to be reservations and sell me a ticket??   I was so disappointed I simply could not buy a ticket from the actual reservations agent.   What kind of service is this???   

Next, I called the next day to the US ticket office and again, was told I could not buy the ticket for a reason I still to this day never understood.   Their answer from the US reservations office (notice it's supposed to be """"reservations""""?) that I had to wait until I got to the airport.   At this point, I was laughing at how poorly the reservations service was for this airline.   Maybe it was just my bad luck... and I had to wonder if others had experienced any issues similar to mine.   

It was too late to change to another airline so I was somewhat committed to flying Asiana and I will say the actual onboard service was quite good as was the food and drink.   But I just have to think how much business they have lost over the years having such horrible website ease of use and actual reservations agents who, apparently are unable (or unwilling) to do their job... Make a Reservation!!!     Wow...     

Never again and I can't in good conscience recommend Asiana to any other regular business travelers.   There are many others who will treat a full fare business flyer with more """"kid gloves"""" if you will."

After a few times flying economy I went to business class in 2012 and since then I always in Business Class and what a great service they were and they are now years after years. Especially in the A380 upstairs, I love it. It’s beutiful setting and quite and wow... awesome. However, there are other airlines out there that I have not been on (international carrier) also have a great service in Business class that I want to try but Asiana always have better schedule and reasonable price for me (to my opinion).

Had much better food options then the usual beef or shell fish on Singapore and once Asiana flight attendants were aware of my food limitations (I was not able to make special meal requests online) I was almost totally ignored for the last six hours of the trip. Had to make repeated calls even for coffee... The seat was reasonably comfortable and the flight attendants smile a lot, but when it comes to service on Aisana the smile just was not enough.

9.41080856323242,6.41730165481567,"Asian Airline Comparison",4,"First the good:
Service was excellent, people friendly and professional.
Seat room was excellent, especially if compared with United Airlines.  There were a couple of free inches between  my knee and the seat in front. (My legs don't fit on United).
The food was good.  Usually a choice of a traditional Korean meal and something like chicken was given.  Just didn't get enough to drink.  A small cup of water came with the meal and after that they pushed coffee and tea.
Baggage-Made it both ways, although in Chicago I was one of the first at the carousels and one of the last to leave.

The bad:
The ORD-ICN flight was scheduled to leave at 11:55 PM, already inconvenient enough.  I went to check in at 8:30 PM, the first anyone showed up behind the Asiana counter, and was told the flight was delayed 8 hours.  They took us to a hotel way north of the airport by a State Farm Insurance complex for 2 /12 hours sleep and shower.  The replacement plane was a 777 that must have been the first or second to roll off the assembly line.  The seats were worn, there was no power, and the screens were smaller than my 7"""" tablet.  As a result of the delay, my connecting flight had already left and I had to get a later flight and then a later Shinkansen, etc.

On the return:
My 7PM flight from Incheon to O'Hare was changed/delayed to 1:20 AM.  I left the airport but don't recommend it as security lines getting back in are longer than the worst ones at O""""Hare.  On top of that, all you get in the secure area are Mont Blanc, Rolex, and ugly brown leather LV bag shops.  There is no convenience store or ATM past security so have your credit card or Korean won ready.  At 0:50 AM, the new boarding time, it was announced that the departure was delayed due to """"flight traffic control"""" and the new boarding time was 01:50 AM,  I left the area as I figured no airline would then leave earlier than announced but, when I got back to the gate at 01:35 AM, the whole plane was already boarded.  The 777 was at least new and had power outlets and USB ports at each seat.

As a result of all the delays, I got back into Chicago an hour after the last bus left and 5 hours before the next (6 AM).  I then had to waste tons of time in O'Hare after wasting a day In Incheon.

Check-in at Fukuoka International Terminal was only 2 hours before the flight.  I had to check out of the hotel in the morning so I went to the airport.  I couldn't check in for 3 hours because they can only check in one flight at a time.  The airport has no waiting room so I had to roam around dragging my luggage until the long line instantly appeared 2 hours before the flight as the bus tours arrived.  I never had this problem in the domestic terminal with JAL or ANA so it's either Asiana or the International Terminal that can't handle check-ins.

I think I picked Asiana just to try a different route to Japan other than though Narita or Haneda, but after this scheduling/delay/rescheduling nightmare, I think I'll go back to JAL or ANA, even if it costs a bit more."

I took Asiana Airlines five years ago to Honolulu, but evidently they are falling behind. Their seatback screens are only a bit larger than my iPhone (I mean iPhone, not iPhone plus), not touch screen, the status of the screen is very terrible. Very dark, you cannot see the contents clearly,  any only less than 40 films. And the films are not choosen, one channel one film, you can change the channel by the remote. But the films are scrolling playback, you even did not know the name of the film. Food is ok, but I have to say they should adope the state-of-the-art amenities, otherwise they will lost passengers."

Because of the delay everyone was itching to get on, The ground crew should of expected this as they were aware of the delay. As soon as boarding started people were lining up in no particular order or seat class because it wasn't clear where anyone should go.  The ground staff was not organized, with 3 different staff members telling me different things. I was made to line up in first class for 20 minutes only to be redirected over to economy with 100 people in line in front of me. Some families with infants and stroller who normally are boarded first were even farther behind me in line. But once we got through the mess the flight itself was fine. We were given an amenities pack with a dental kit and slippers and my 9yr was still given one of those kid's play packs. Seats were comfy (though I wish it wasn't cloth seats and leather instead), our korean meals were tasty (thanks for the hot pepper paste), in flight entertainment had alot of variety but unluckily I was stuck with the flight attendant that really hated her job.

Food was lousy which seemed to be lacking in balance. For instance, in one of the meals, they served Bibimbap with ground meat and the other offering was Beef too. Normally, it would be a choice of red meat or either fish/chicken. Not all were poor. Some offerings were good also. 

Asiana's movies too are limited which is not a good idea for a long flight! Nevertheless, I enjoyed watching  the classic """"Breakfast at Tiffany's"""".

Cruising was good. It was a comfortable ride. Seats were okay. 

Flight attendants need to be more service oriented, like giving drinks from time to time. In my experiences in flying this is the first time that I've encountered such service that was lacking in hospitality. Good thing I brought some snacks that I could munch while waiting for the next meal with a confused body due to time zone difference. Other airlines I've flown with offer main meals with little snacks in between, with some drinks in between too. 

Next time, will consider other airlines."

I have flown on Asiana Airlines before, and the experience was the same; friendly and courteous, with very attentive flight attendants. Flew round trip to and from Korea. Service was excellent with two meals and a snack. In-flight entertainment was very good and on a long flight to Seoul, there was time to watch several movies if you wanted. We took off before noon for an 81/2 hour flight, so I napped to find a nice note from the attendant asking if I would like to have my skipped meal. Frequently checked on passengers' needs and the meals were very good. (I chose a Korean meal.) The cleanliness and size of the bathroom were a nice surprise, included mouth wash and toothbrush and toothpaste! The person sitting across from me was over 6 feet tall and she was impressed, and watched five movies! I will be flying on Asiana Airlines again in the future."

The food and beverage offered were of average quality; I noticed that no Champagne was offered before the take-off (used to it from Swiss and Lufthansa). The flight attendants were attentive and very professional.  Unfortunately, the flight from Incheon to London was less than optimal in that the food was quite bad (some dishes couldn't be consumed). I understand that Asiana Airlines were dealing with a temporary catering company, but the food in the Business class was quite substandard.  Additionally, it appears that the cleaning crew forgot to clean and restock one of the lavatories in business class as there was no soap and no paper towels.  Once again, the service provided by the flight attendants were pleasant; however, the airline could improve tremendously."

Since my turn around time in ICN was about 2 hours, that meant that I would miss the ICN to MNL leg.  The agent told me that Asiana would put me up in a hotel and put me on the next available flight out of ICN. He then told me that personnel in ICN would take care of things.  I checked a bag through to MNL and went to the lounge.  After a little thought, i decided I didn't want to rely on what might happen at 10:30 at night in a foreign airport.  I contacted a pasenger assistance rep in the lounge, and she got my ticket to MNL.  When I arrived in ICN, I, and maybe 60 other people had to go through immigration and customs, and then wander the full length of the airport in search of magical """"Transfer Desk"""".  There we were given a hotel voucher, and put on buses to the Days Inn, which is probably 15 minutes from the airport.  We arraived at the hotel, and were told that check in was on the 4th floor. There was only 1 working elevator ( of 5) and we slowly made our way to check-in.  This took another 20 minutes, at which time we were given our room keys and a complementary dinner - a plastic bag with a bottle of water and a round tub of something.  Gourmet, no doubt. By the time I got to my room, it was nearly midnight. Since we were told that the buses to the airport would leave at 5 AM, I put in a wake up call for 4 AM.  No coffee. No breakfast. And worst of all, no Asiana personnel to take care of their passengers.  As a result of this, I lost a prepaid non - refundable hotel room in Manila, and a prepaid non-refundable plane ticket from Manila to Dumaguete.  And Asiana didn't want to hear about."

Five stars for the privacy of my single seat on the right-side aisle and the delicious food choices for a fish-eating vegetarian: marinated shrimp appetizer with a mixed seafood entree and a delightful cheese course before the fresh fruit and chocolate mousse for dessert. Calorie counts were on the menu. The flight departed at almost midnight, so dinner was quickly served before the lights were turned out. There was also a breakfast about two hours before landing. Traditional Korean food like Bibimbap is also served, 
The flight attendants busted their butts for the entire flight and I got a big smile when I complimented them on the beautiful silver tea and coffee service like the one I received for my wedding and haven't ever used. """"Too heavy,"""" they said. My only in-flight criticism is that the drinks never seemed to arrive at the right time. I usually wound up with my food in front of me while waiting until the beverage cart showed up. Shouldn't it be the other way around? However, I got six hours of sleep and watched a couple of movies with great sound quality on the headphones provided and a large screen. Plan to finish your movie in plenty of time because it will be interrupted to show an exercise video about 20 minutes before landing, with most of the passengers participating in the stretching exercises.
Upon arrival, I found the Senator Lounge closed and a crowd of people waiting outside. As a Star Alliance Gold Status member, I rely on these lounges to recharge when I have to travel in economy and I certainly expect a lounge to be waiting when I've paid extra for business class. Because the lounge was operated by Asiana, it's hard to believe they didn't know travelers would be arriving at 4:30 am. When the lounge finally did open at 5 am, the cleaning people were still at work and the food was not ready. There was a long line to check in and the early arrivals cleared out the buffet, which wasn't replenished until an hour later. Not the standard I've come to expect from Star Alliance member airlines and I hope they'll improve this in the future. 
I should add that my connecting flight to Hanoi was in exactly the same kind of plane, so both in-flight legs of the journey were delightful. I arrived rested, well-fed and ready to work."

NO ONE EVER LOOKED AT HIS KENNEL, HIMSELF, OR INFORMATION.

The flight is 23 hours with two layovers. Also the flights i booked was operated by 
delta/skywest and Asiana. Obviously very long for a pet but he was IN CABIN with me on all three of the flights and did meow a lot but we did what we had to do and it wasn't to bad. The Vet gave me gabapentin just incase he was freaking out which I tried to give him and it didn't seem to do much once  on the plane. I pretty much held his carrier on my lap and had my arm in the cage to pet him and sooth him and that was most effective. Make sure to give him little treats over time to calm in and little bit of water. My cat was very thirst but I limited his water since in the family restrooms when I laid out something to pee on he would not go.

It was actually very easy with airlines once at the airports but research proper dimensions of the cage and what paperwork was not easy at all. It took a ton of time calling since it's something I wanted to make sure of. 

DELTA: cost $200 to bring my cat on board. They said they required cats and dogs must be accompanied by a Veterinarian Good Health and Rabies Inoculation Certificate issued at the port of origin. dated within 10 days of flying. So basically, the vet looked at him to make sure he has him shots up to date and looked healthy and I paid 50$. """"On DL 4627 operated by our connection carrier SkyWest, kennel dimensions should not exceed 15L 15W 10H. On DL 159, the maximum under seat dimensions are 14L 15W 8.8H"""" told to me from Delta.
Their number to help: 1 800 221 1212

MY cage was too big but it was a hard bottom and soft on top so I figured I could push it down if necessary but I was never asked to show the pet health certificate or anything and they never looked at him or the size of his carrier, I just paid the fee. 

For ASIANA: They just said that he had to be less than 15 pounds with the carrier included in that weight, which he was not but they never even looked or checked. For a soft kennel, they said the cage needed to be less than 10 inches and if a car carrier than it needed to be less than 8 inches. Mine was too tall again but i knew I could push it down and they never checked. They also wanted the same certificate of good health but never checked. I had to pay $160 to them even though I already paid Delta, that doesn't matter you have ti pay both. 
Their number to help was: 1 800 227 4262

So, my cat did pee on my during the last 3 hours of the last flight and it was horrible and got all over me since I was holding but I rushed to the bathroom and tried to rinse it all but I smelled horrible.

Since Asiana doesn't fly from DC, the DC-SF leg was handled by Virgin.  Here they messed up.  I paid for the extra checked baggage, and the fee was collected by Virgin.  Yet when I checked in at SFO, Asiana wanted me to pay for it again.  It turned out Virgin did not give me a  coupon that I supposed to give to Asiana.  Instead of working out between them, they had me running back and forth between their counters (20min walk) half a dozen times before a counter agent figured out that I should get a refund from Virgin, and charged again by Asiana.  The whole business cost me a good 2 hours of running between the counters, and gave me a good sweat out exercise.

But it was hellish when there wasn't a bassinet seat available (where I could also sit near my toddler and hubby).  Asiana squeezed us in a code share flight to Los Angeles with passengers from other airlines and we weren't aware that the layout of the plane also changed.  Horror of horrors, our seats wouldn't recline properly and it was so hot and cramped in the flight; the kids weren't able to sleep at all.

11.1505670547485,8.00930786132812,"Asiana Flight Review",4,"I flew 4 long segments, so I think that gave me a pretty good perspective on what they offer. All were in economy, but with lounge access. 

The good:

Slightly better seat pitch than you get on US airlines. Every extra inch helps. 

FAs were polite, not surly like Delta or Air Canada in economy class. And their foreign language skills were versatile, unlike say Air China. On the flight to Tashkent, they even spoke passable Russian. 

They didn't hassle me about carry-ons on any segment, even though flights were mostly full. These days airlines are being increasingly onerous about carry-on sizes, and often make you check in bags that fit perfectly fine. Props to Asiana for not being jerks that way. It's a sad commentary on the state of airline travel that just normal decency puts you a cut above the rest these days. 

Another nasty little trick they DON'T do like some other airlines, is wait an inordinate of time to serve the food, so that more people go to sleep and FAs have fewer people to serve. Here, they get the meal over with very efficiently, and then let everyone sleep. 

Food was pretty good even for coach. But choices were limited (remember when airlines gave you 3 choices?). I figured it was best to stick to the Korean options, since it's a Korean airline, and I wasn't disappointed. I mean, who can get excited about pasta? But the bibimbap and beef bulgogi were surprisingly well done. Drinks, especially alcoholic, were surprisingly limited for a long haul international flight. 

Power outlets everywhere. Didn't use them but it's a nice touch. 

Flights were mostly on time, and when they weren't, they did their best. Our flight from Tashkent was delayed by 45 minutes. The crew was very apologetic, saying with a hint of  justifiable resentment, """"We're sorry for the delay, due to extra security checks from the government of Uzbekistan."""" 

The bad:

Entertainment choices were limited. A few mediocre new releases like """"Black Panther,"""" but mostly the entertainment seemed to be carefully curated to show the most vapid, empty, cookie cutter movies possible. From SFO to ICN, I settled on """"Battleship Island,"""" a Korean film with one-dimensional caricatures the point of which seemed to be to illustrate just how much Korea hates Japan. 

The pillows were foam, unworthy of pilfering. Standard for coach on US carriers, but I expected better from Asiana. Air France and Lufthansa provide real feather pillows in coach, something that I'm grateful for years after the fact. ;)

Nothing special about the A350. It's not the A380, that's for sure! But it beats the heck out of Boeing's insultingly named """"Dreamliner,"""" a nightmare with shades that don't even close. 

The Business Class lounge:
Again, not quite what the best carriers offer, but oh so much better than anything in the US. The showers were well-appointed, tasteful, and clean... a godsend after a June day in muggy Seoul on a 12-hour layover. Most importantly, they were available. 

Also available was luggage storage, for free. Again, very useful for that 12 hour layover. 

Lots of computers for use at the business center. 

Food was mediocre, which is where they don't particularly shine compared to some international carriers, but quite enough to fill you up. Alcohol choices were drinkable enough though. Better than anything on the plane, so I knew to drink up before my flight to SFO (haha!)

Ultimately, though, the mark of a good flight vs a bad flight is whether there's space to spread out. The flight to Tashkent wasn't full, so I grabbed a bench and got a serious 5 hours of sleep across 3 seats. But that only happened 1 out 4 flights. Used to be that you could do this all the time. 

Bottom line: decent airline by today's standards, but it's hard to get excited about a flight that's packed to the gills."

We flew with them for the first (and last time) to go to Japan last April. We had an entirely 12h DAY flight but we were not allowed to open the window nor switch on the lights to read at anytime. We were also not allowed to walk around the aircraft at all because that was bothering the others passengers who wanted to sleep. The crew was not nice at all with us. They told us it was their culture and we just have to watch a movie and shut up. The screen was terrible and the selection very poor with films only in Chinese, Korean or English... but my parents do not speak English and just wanted to look out the window or read a book. That was just not possible as we had to stay in the total darkness. We really felt discriminated and will never fly with Asiana again."

Asiana's 777 economy class is 9 seats and two aisles across, which is very much better than most airlines which have now reconfigured to be 10 seats and 2 aisles.  The extra width makes a big difference after a few hours.

The service is above average and meals were significantly better than average.  The flight attendants were attentive but not so active that is was hard to sleep.

The entertainment is a bit dated but serviceable with a wide selection of options.  On down side there was no power at the seat on this plane.  The plane on way back did have USB power at the seat.

I have to admit to still being skeptical about the safety and training of pilots flying for Korean airlines.  The record is much better than it was in the 1980s and early 1990s, but the Asiana incident in San Francisco just a few years ago was still a result of poor pilot training.  However, our trip was fine or I wouldn't be writing this review.  Same with each of the last three times I've taken this flight.  Still one star missing after spending a whole flight wondering about pilot training."

It was just a very short domestic flight from Seoul to Jeju Island so you would think that on such a short flight there would not be any service but there was!

I called to make a reservation on April 7th for my flight, and I also booked a reservation with my emotional support animal. It was accepted and everything was alright. I called back to reschedule the flight, as there was a similar flight leaving around the same time that was 6 hours shorter. The reservation call center representative happily rebooked my flight, but they failed to tell me that they cancelled my emotional support animal reservation. From my knowledge, everything was fine as it was the SAME agent who cancelled and rebooked my flight who added my emotional support animal reservation.

We made our connecting flight to NYC from Boston, where we went to check in with Asiana. They said we had no reservation on file as the original reservation was cancelled with the flight that was rebooked. There was apparently nothing they could do about it. The girl we worked with Alleyah, was very nice and tried to accommodate us, but her manager told her they would not make any exceptions today because there were already other dogs on the flight. They then tried to tell us that we would not be allowed to bring our dog, because we did not have a USDA stamped letter. When I called the USDA, they said that I DO NOT NEED a stamp to enter Korea on a LAYOVER. Regardless, I have since obtained a USDA stamp and I have all necessary paperwork. We could have made our flight that day but the staff at the airport REFUSED to allow us.

We are now STRANDED in New York for several days until this is resolved. Asiana is trying to blame us and make us pay additional fees to reschedule. We own an import/export business in Vietnam and will be contacting our lawyers to obtain the recordings of the voice calls as subsequent staff admitted that the original service member should have told us to rebook the emotional support animal reservation.

The outbound flight was in a brand new aircraft, and you could smell the newness.
The seat (27A) was comfortable and reclined just that little more than other Economy seats of old. The screen for entertainment was large and the newer models now mean you are less likely to be irritated by your neighbour’s screen light blaring out at you. The headphones however, did little to cut out external noise like the screaming baby several rows in front. If you’re trying to watch a movie in the first and last hours of your flight, forget it. The unnecessary amount of announcements about Duty Free shopping, ads and meal services, was so bad that I gave up using the system and opted to watch movies on my iPad instead.(And at least my own headphones drowned out that screaming baby).
Meals were fresh and served quickly. My only bone of contention was that every meal, including breakfast, has rice!  Staff were polite and helpful, but reluctant to serve alcoholic beverages after the first 2 drinks, citing concerns for my health. (Thanks, but I’ll be the judge of that.)
The aircraft boasted a multi-coloured lighting system, but this was not used. In fact, the crew could use some serious training on using this, because on both outbound and inbound flights, they deemed it necessary to smash the lights on to full power, going from complete and relaxing darkness to neon white in an instant! (Cue screaming baby again). This made many of us passengers uncomfortable and grumpy. Not to mention the same reiteration of Duty Free ads.
All in all, the flight was reasonable and comfortable and I’ll likely use this airline again, especially given the fact that airlines like British Airways ticket prices have become a joke! But I would hope to see less advertising and better use of the multi-coloured lighting system. And perhaps some training for crew in turning off personal seating lights for those passengers who are sleeping so their light doesn’t light up the cabin when we’re all trying to sleep! And it wouldn’t hurt to turn the cabin temperature down a degree or two. Not all passengers are okay with flying in hot air."

He also walked away from us while we were expressing concerns. 

Very disorganized when flight was cancelled. No clear communication of what was going on with our flight until they led us to get our checked bags and was being led to a line up for a hotel. All 300 people fighting to get on buses to get to hotel at 2am with a clear lack of organizination from the airlines. People were pushing and shoving each other to get to the bus. Airline staff did not know how to speak English and had to ask a different airline’s staff to translate to answer our questions. We ended up taking our own cab to get to the hotel.

Domestic Flights Asiana Airlines is Misleading though. I bought Domestic Tickets from the Asiana Airlines website.
 
The reason I buy tickets from Asiana is because they are Star Alliance. Im Singapore Airlines PPS Club (Gold Star Alliance) and I was refused entry to the domestic lounge because although my tickets are bought from Asiana but codeshare Air Busan (a subsidiary of Asiana Airlines) isn’t Star Alliance. THIS IS DEFINITELY MISLEADING!
I can check in at the Priority Lane but cannot access the lounge because its Air Busan BUT I bought the tickets with ASIANA. at Jeju Airport, the Asiana Ground Staff keep reminding everyone waiting at the Priority Lane that we must hold Gold Cards to check in (tbh, I was bewildered and amused). if I had known that this was the case, I would have bought Korea Air instead because I have Sky Priority and can access the Lounge.

Conclusion, THATS IT for ASIANA! no more flying ASIANA! Im sticking with other Airlines that does not mislead. I think Im very fair in giving them a score of 8 for International and 1 for Domestic.

Baggage:
1x 23kg suitcase

Comfort:
In Economy, the 3-3-3 configuration is good. In fact, the seats were a little cramped for me knee-wise (188cm height), so I really appreciated the longer backs to the chairs, and the fact that the height-adjustable headrests stayed up.  Width-wise it was fine.  Plenty of storage space in the chair back - table was clean (as clean as can be for a plane table) and stayed level, rather than dropped on worn-out hinges.  No foot-hammock. 

Didn’t have any IFE units in the footwell spaces for seats A-C - great!

Service (inc Timeliness):
Departed approx 24 minutes late due to hold ups on the apron.  All in all, the flight was boarded in about 25 minutes which is quite impressive for a B777. 

Slippers were handed out but no eye mask or ear plugs. 
Toothbrush set in the toilets.  

IFE:
The older Asiana Airlines entertainment, featuring flight map graphics and old-school layout.  Screen was a good size and touchscreen, contrast was poor and a fair level of glare on the monitor screen.  The seat back contained a USB port and the arm-rest a dual-pin headphone socket.  USB port had sufficient ampage to charge an iPad - albeit slowly.  Two power points per 3 seats, which is generous. 

Catering:
Meals: Dinner within an hour after departing ICN, and a breakfast about 1h 15m before landing.  
For dinner, offered a choice of Western (chicken and potatoes) or Korean (Beef, rice and Ssimbap).  Opted for the Korean meal and really enjoyed it, especially the interactive nature of the salad leaves, and the tasty Korean bean dumplings for dessert.   Dinner was served hot.
For breakfast, offered either Chicken Rice porridge or Omelette with potatoes and vegetables.  Opted for the plain omelette but was disappointed that it was covered in a white cheese floury cream sauce, and the omelette was lukewarm.  Side dishes included fresh pineapple, blueberry Yoplait yoghurt and bread roll with butter.  A sachet of tomato sauce included, but no salt and pepper though.

See photos of menu.

Mid-flight snacks: None.

Water runs - only two which is disappointing for a 10 hour flight.  No post-dinner drink run for refills either.  Hot drinks weren’t really hot at all.

Quite surprised that they started serving the lunch within an hour of taking off (so 11am Brisbane time).  No pre-dinner drinks for Economy in the style of Singapore Airlines.

Key Staff:  
Friendly smile and Korean welcome on-board.

Miscellaneous Nugget:
Two firsts on this flight - this was my first long-haul trip with Asiana Airlines, and my first direct flight Korea to Australia.  

In general, was not impressed by OZ service, food and the plane - it was reliable rather than stand-out.   Best thing was the excellent leg room in cattle class.

Amazing food - I never knew airline food could taste this good.  4 course dinner: Caprese salad with fresh mint leaves, tomato, and delicious cheese with tiny bottle of balsamic vinegar - I was already impressed by this dish. Then came my seafood pasta dish with 2 prawns and 2 scallops - both done right; and the al dente pasta with a scrumptious mushroom sauce.  I try to not eat too much carbs so I let my daughter try some pasta and she took it from me.  (she chose something else that wasn't as impressive - take note).  Then cheese course - slice of brie and another semi-soft cheese with crackers and fruits - really good cheese.  Then tiramisu for dessert.  It felt as if I went to a good restaurant and had a great meal.  

Breakfast was just a amazing.  The croissant was warm and super flaky!!  I usually don't eat airplane croissants because they tend to just look like one from the outside but is just chewy dry bread on the inside.   Asiana croissant deserves a sonnet!  There were fruit slices carefully cut up and a yogurt.  

I really believe in quality over quantity and the food that Asiana served was cooked and selected with care.  Thank you!

Service was professional and kind.  
Seats were comfy - I just put my eye patches and earbuds in and try to go to sleep. 
Entertainment was fine - I watched a movie.
Landing was a bit rough - not like a gentle embrace of the ground - more like a rough tumble.  But, all was safe and good.  

The only part that was a departure from the high level of service this flight impressed on me was the Asiana Lounge in Seoul.  First, their posted hours were incorrect.  We landed in Seoul before ANY lounge was open (around 5m) so we tried to look up the hours and went back to check a couple of times but different times were posted at the closed gate vs the website. I asked the 'not very helpful' information desk who told us that the Lounge open sometime between 6 and 7am, but weren't sure. - not very informational.  We checked at 6am and still saw the Close sign. We sat at the chairs at the Gates to try to get some rest, and then checked the Lounge at 6:30am and it was open and seemed to be opened for a bit as there were quite some people there already...so really confused as to when they opened.  Food was just ok.  The best part was the shower."
8.85431861877441,10.0139989852905,"Asian Airline Comparison",4,"Travelled with Asiana from London Heathrow to Sydney, via business class, as the cost was the best value against other carriers, and the duration was equivalent. First time with Asiana and in business class and we thought the service was superb.  

The seats from London were lovely, converting to bed like state, and the food and service both awesome. The lounge access was also appreciated, and the accelerated passage through passport control and getting our bags.

Only downside, the flight from Incheon to Sydney could have been better.  We couldn’t select the seats online for our flight from Incheon to Sydney, all were shown as unavailable. When checking in only two seats were left which meant my wife and I had to be separated.  It was clear when we got on that flight that the other passengers had selected theirs, so was this a case of preferences for passengers booking in Korea over those using Incheon for a transfer? Also, the plane was tired, not as nicely presented and the entertainment functionality a bit old.

We’d fly with them again, as the value for money is good, although the seat selection issue would need resolving."

We got two choices for breakfast: scrambled egg or shrimp. Had the quite same price with Garuda Indonesia at the moment, I didn't regret choosing Asiana to have new experience of flying. All of the stewardess are Korean, very professional and efficient. I could choose the seat online for free, the seat were large and comfortable.

Toilet is always clean. Good point for me! But especially if you are going to Istanbul, planes have old multimedia system (especially headphone jack always make me annoyed not working well ) 
They have to improve check in service at airport. They are too strict sorry :)  By the way they must change or make some improvement on their website. It is not their class."

The seat was a flat bed on the A380 and I had the last seat in the section in front of lavatories.  Not ideal in terms of noise but I got a much better rest than had I been in a reclining seat in economy.  Lights were dimmed rather late after takeoff.  The meal was served a few hours before arrival at Incheon so it was a bleary-eye breakfast but very good and served with white cloth and silver.  I highly recommend Asiana business class!"

Seat 2E, a closed suite, was extremely comfortable.  The suite was equipped with a large 32"""" television and a personal closet for hanging your clothes.  When it was time to sleep, you were provided with a pair of soft pajamas (you picked your size!) and slippers.  While you were changing, the flight attendant converted your seat into a bed that was wide and long enough for a larger-than-average man.  It was topped with a mattress pad, blanket, and duvet.  The lights were dimmed in the cabin and the ceiling was dotted with tiny stars.  So soothing!  The only downsides to the flight were the food (which was plentiful but rather lackluster [I selected from the Korean menu]) and the very limited selection of movies.  I should mention that one of the TV choices was a feed from a camera mounted in the cockpit which provided AMAZING views of the taxi, takeoff and landing!!  That was awesome!  I would absolutely fly this A380 route again...but would pre-load my iPad with movies."

In-flight entertainment is sorely lacking in selection.  If you've got kids, better load up their iPads or bring them lots of toys.

The cabin was WARM.  UNCOMFORTABLY WARM.  

For the first long haul, the flight attendant adjusted it maybe 2 degrees and it became bearable, but still not comfortable.  

Our long haul on the way back was just as warm, and despite several requests to lower the temperature, we were just plain ignored. Not even after I showed the flight attendant that my son was perspiring and restless in his sleep.

Even after I heard other passengers (not just myself and my husband) complain.  I would understand if a majority of the passengers had requested to keep it on the warm side, but our section wasn't full and quite frankly, my family of 5 pretty much outnumbered the other passengers who were travelling solo or in pairs.  

The food was okay.  Nothing spectacular but not really awful.  My steak was served at room temperature, and it arrived late for some reason and I was starving, so I took it and didn't bother sending it back, lest it take another 30 minutes.

When we arrived in Manila, not one but TWO of our luggage were badly damaged.  Oh and did I mention that this airline is fond of altering departure time?  So our connecting flight was delayed and we barely made the next one, but alas, our luggage did not.  It was delivered the next day to our home, but yes, with a large crack in each piece.  Bear in mind, one was a Samsonite and the other a Briggs and Riley.  I don't know if I've just been lucky all these years travelling or what, but this is the first time I've ever experienced damaged luggage.

I reported it to their website, which stated that all reports of damage had to be made within 7 days of the flight.  Lo and behold, I got a """"Page Cannot Be Found"""" error when I submitted the form.  So I emailed the only other email address I had on file and I got a polite message saying I had mistakenly sent my complaint to reservations, but my complaint would be forwarded to the correct department.  I replied back that I did make an attempt on the website and got an error reply and I NEVER HEARD FROM THEM AGAIN.

For my Vietnam trip however, Asiana offered the best deal, and it really was quite a good price. They're business class offers single seats next to windows and double seats in the middle, all offering quite good privacy from fellow travelers. Service was very good, seats comfortable, food good, and fairly ample booze; all of my requirements for long distance flights! The entertainment choices for movies may have been a bit limited for my choice, but I don't care at all about that, I always bring plenty of electronics and reading materials. They lay-down seats were good, however your feet wind up in sort of a cubby area that limits mobility a bit. But the overall experience for me was really very good.

I would like to keep this simple. 

Entertainment: 3/5
There are a lot of negative reviews on the Entertainment system, but I felt that it was just enough to keep me entertained, but i can definitely agree with some of the limitations compared to many of the other international airlines in the world. 

Seats: 4.5/5
If you are traveling alone, you should try and secure the window seats.   It offers more privacy and space compared to the middle seats.    Asiana provides private suites for First Class customers with closing doors.    My door was slightly damaged that I was not able to enclose it completely.   It was not a deal killer.    The seats overall was spacious and wide that anyone would feel comfortable in any shape or size. 

Food: 4.5/5
You are capable of preordering from a special menu before your departure.  I was able to order the galbi.   The meal feels like it goes on forever.    There is a tremendous amount of food and the main entree comes with the typical Korean sides such as kimchi and other pickled vegetables.   I enjoy Korean food in general and it was a definite treat to have the opportunity to eat Korean food on our flight.    

I would consider the food on Asiana's first class to be up there with Air France's First Class which is phenomenal.    We flew Qatar's business class product as well during this trip as well.    Qatar has a great product in general in terms of service and seats but the food itself is subpar compared to Asiana and Air France.   

Amenities: The restroom is small and limited for First Class compared to other international airlines.  It does not have a shower as Emirates.   Qatar has a bar on the plane.    Asiana has a bar, but it is limited.

On my flight to Japan (layover in Incheon, Korea), most of the flight attendants were friendly and helpful. However, the women next to me had lots of questions and one flight attendant seemed irritated with her. When she needed her medication from the overhead bin before take off, she asked twice before another passenger helped her. She was given the """"wait"""" signal both times and then seemed to have been forgotten. When the meals came, she asked what was in them and was rudely told if she had diet restrictions, she should have noted it during the ticket booking. The women just wanted to know if anything was spicy as she would have an upset stomach. That was not an option for meals like being diabetic is. 

Entertainment: the movie options were plenty in multiple languages. I wish they had English subtitles on all their movies. 

Seats: were comfortable enough. I was born with extra leg room as I like to say when asked if I'd like that upgrade (I'm 5 ft), but the guy on my other side seemed pretty tall and needed to stretch out often. 

Food: Usually 2 options of Western like chicken/potatoes and Korean of marinated beef (bulgogi)/rice. Slight variations on the return trip (bibimbap or veggie wrap).

My travel agent suggested I try Asiana, having never heard of them I was slightly concerned at first, but read reviews and watched Youtube videos from paying customers, which helped me make the choice of using them, excellent service.

Checking in at Heathrow, you are guided through to the separate fast track security check in which literally took me 3 mins, great first experience and then straight to the Business lounge which again was a great experience, spacious, quiet with all the food and drink you could possibly want or need. Boarding the plane was also very fast and I will say now that on all four flights, I could not fault the Asiana cabin crew, polite, attentive and a little later I will touch on one member going the extra mile for customer  service.

The departing flight time was 20.10, after a great choice of food  and a number of glasses of port, I went to sleep on the full length bed and woke up 2 hours before landing at Seoul having had a very comfortable sleep. The welcome pack waiting in  my seat took care of all required needs form slippers to teeth cleaning etc. 

An estimate of your seating width  space is about 2.5 seats in economy with the row in front of you taken out, see photos. On all four flights I booked window seats with the associated pod being next to the aisle giving a feeling or even more privacy.

My connecting flight was 4 hours later, Incheon airport is vast and the business lounge took a little finding as the signs seemed to indicate it was upstairs, it is in fact on the main level on the left hand side as you walk down the main concourse, after checking in at reception, you are greeted by 2 large lounges with numerous privacy zones if required. On checking in at reception, I requested a shower, I was booked in and given a buzzer notification, 20 minutes later I was refreshed and ready for the next leg. Probably a 10 - 15 minute walk to the boarding gate ( due to the size of airport ) and after another speedy check in,  off I set again, At this stage I swapped my timing to Sydney time, more food and drink and took a sleeping table to help me sleep to assist in falling in with the Sydney time zone. I arrived at 08.20 local time, ready for my son.

I can say, I did not have any jet lag at all doing the above which was surprising to say the least I was though my actions may reduce not negate the jet lag

Be aware that entering Sydney, there is no fast track for Business class and due to the Australians strict entrance rules, this process took a while to clear as this is a two levelled process.

Leaving Sydney was the only fly in the ointment with this flight experience. Business lounge was great, however, when the call notification for boarding came up and attending the gate, it was mayhem. I was called to gate 16, what it didn't say was gate 16 had numerous sub departure areas A-G (I think), one member of airport staff attempting to police this with a strap band as a barrier leading to downstairs to the departure buses taking you to the plane. Therefore, with 6 - 7 plane loads of people trying to get into this zone, even though Business class was called first, it didn't work, you are then herded onto a bus to take you to the plane, again, Business class being irrelevant, however, once on the plane , normal service was resumed, so this comment is  not directed at Asiana, but Sydney airport itself.

Take off time in Sydney was 09.15, landing back at Incheon at 18.40 local time, the return flight had an option of an overnight stay in a hotel 10 minutes from the airport which I took and would recommend as again, this helped negate any jet lag and this is where I refer you to my earlier comment about a member of staff going the extra mile.

I actually had never received information about which hotel I was staying at, all I knew was it had been confirmed, I explained this to the cabin crew manager ( who had introduced herself to each individual personally in Business class , she walked me off the plane, and took me to a section within the airport that I would never have found 
( this took about 10  minutes) , explained this situation and within minutes, the issue was resolved.

Following morning, checked out of the hotel at 11.00, taken to the airport for a departing flight of 14.30, I took a 2 hour sleep on this flight with an arrival time of 18.55 local time, again, not a jot of jet lag. 

All I can say is that when I visit my son again, it will be Asiana Business class with hopefully the same flight times, what a great experience at a cost of £2650 as opposed to most other being at least £1000 more, one more thing, Monty Don, was on my return flight from Seoul, so if its good enough for Monty, enough said ....."

I lucked out in that the plane was packed but the Premium Economy section was nearly empty, my entire row was just me.  The flight attendants were fine with me laying down across all three seats and sleeping most of the flight away.

Positives:
Legroom in PE was fantastic, comparable to JetBlue in the USA.  

Entertainment options: Plenty of stuff to watch.  Included movies, TV, radio.  There is an in-seat messenger system built into the entertainment system too.

Food was surprisingly good.  I was surprised to receive real silverware!  Bread, microwave-level main course, then tea or coffee.  Attendants are remarkably attentive, I got asked if I wanted something roughly every 30 minutes.

Slippers and a toiletry kit are provided!  This may have been a PE benefit, I don't know.

Negatives:
While the outbound flight checked our tickets and made sure we were in the right spot, my return flight didn't do that.  We had a rush of people crowding the premium economy seats (someone even tried to take mine!) before complaining.
One meal was extremely spicy, no warning given.  Me and my entire row breathed fire for a few minutes (none of us liked spicy food).
While I'm used to paying for Premium Economy on long flights, Asiana had one of the more expensive costs for that upgrade ($150) that I've paid.  Typically it's $120 or so, $60 cheaper round trip.
While PE got to board with first class on the way out (cool unexpected perk) we did not on the way back (I actually got stopped at the gate).  If they hadn't boarded me on the way out I would have missed it, but I was kinda irritated after they took it away.

Lounges - can use Star Alliance lounges. United was the best one at Heathrow. The Asiana lounge in Seoul was very busy, and not particularly good, although the showers were fine. Food choice there was poor. Best lounge at Sydney was the Air NZ lounge. The Singapore Airlines lounge was busy and cramped. 

Aircraft - none of our 4 flights was on the aircraft type stated at the time of booking. Only an A350 on LHR to Seoul (not the A380 that Trailfinders told us it would be), so it was small and cramped (nowhere to stretch/ exercise for instance). 777-200 between Seoul and Sydney was tired and past it's best. 

Onboard - it was a sea of beige, with the worst entertainment system I've seen in the last 20 to 30 years. The screen on the 777 was old and low resolution. Very little choice of movies etc. Legroom and seat comfort were fine. Air quality was as bad as it is on other aircraft and air lines. Particularly frustrating that the window blinds were all pulled down as soon as we had taken off, and kept down for the entire flight, despite it being in daylight and in normal daytime hours of destination time. 

Staff - were generally good, but the standard of English amongst both flight and Seoul based ground staff was poor. We simply gave up trying to ask for things, it was too difficult. 

Meals - were mixed. Main meals were good, but snacks were poor (not even a chocolate bar available). Staff came round once per flight to offer drinks/ water etc. (flight times of between 10 and 12 hours per flight). Didn't appear to be any snacks available between meals. This is not what I expect in any airline class, but particularly not in Business Class. They served a snack (roll, crips or noodles) half way between meal times. Limited wine choice, but the wines were ok, just not particularly good. 

Compulsory night's layover in Seoul - when we booked it we were told it would be a 4 or 5 star hotel in Seoul. They don't tell you which hotel you'll be in until you reach the Asiana arrivals desk after immigration. It took nearly 2 hours to get to the hotel from landing. We were offered a Howard Johnson hotel """"nearby"""", which was in fact a mixed Howard Johnson/ Days Inn near the airport. Initially, we were put in a Days Inn room (which is definitely NOT a 4 or 5 star room - I've attached a photo of it for reference). Complained, moved us to a Howard Johnson room (we were told that reception staff are instructed to put Asiana passengers in the Days Inn rooms). There was a pool & gym, but there was a charge for using them. Basically we did not get the 4 or 5 star hotel in Seoul we were told we would get, at the time of booking. So if you are thinking of flying Sydney to London in Business Class, be aware of this.

Incidentally, the hotel was an hour from Seoul. The next morning we tried to get to Seoul by train (no shuttle or other transport available) but found that we couldn't buy a rail ticket to Seoul with a credit card (cash only!), & there was nowhere to change cash, so we were stuck. 

All in all, disappointing product, and the hotel arrangements for the compulsory layover in Seoul were unacceptable. Would NOT fly Asiana again."

Boarding the plane was little chaotic because even though they announce to board by rows, passengers were still boarding irregardless of where they sat. Their ground crew should enforce the rules of boarding starting from the back rows going forward for economy passengers by carefully checking their seat #.  It should not be determine where you stand in line but rather by seat row also...  ."

The great thing about sitting in this location is that there's a large storage bin next to the window seat. There was in-seat power through a USB port, a very large in-flight entertainment screen with lots of entertainment options, and ample legroom. I was shocked by how many delicious meals we were served. Asiana offers a Western and Korean option for each meal. Between meals, the flight attendants constantly circulated water and orange juice. The flight attendants were very professional and strict on all safety measures. During flight, they required passengers to close the windows to create an environment conducive to sleep. Overall, a wonderful trans-Pacific flight in economy. I'd be happy to fly Asiana again."

I have done two flights now from Seattle to Manila (layover in S. Korea). The last flight I had less than an hour layover without problems because the plane was able to land on time. The seats are normal size and comfortable for me (6ft 2, 300 lbs). 
On the 12 hour flight everyone in Economy is offered 2 meals. They also come with drinks (orange juice, and water) every few hours. On the 4 hour flight everyone is offered 1 meal and drinks are offered periodically as well. They have two types of meals to choose from which usually consisted of one Korean themed meal and one Western style. They also have vegetarian options available. 
All of my flights with the airline have been in planes that offer touch screen media players with a variety of films available. The longer flights offer about a dozen current Hollywood films along with about half as many classic Hollywood films. There is also news, games, tv shows, and in flight information (showing location, remaining time, time at origin, time at destination). They have children’s shows/movies and the last flight offered a small coloring book to all of the kids on the flight. 
There is plenty of bathrooms on each plane to accommodate the amount of people. One of the flights offered free toothpaste and brushes in the bathroom. One annoyance is the last flight they did not have overhead signs to show the vacancy of the bathroom for people sitting near the front of the plane. It did not pose a problem because they allowed individuals to wait near the bathrooms for vacancy (something that I have not been able to do with other airlines). 
Both flights were booked via search engine website. Last flight price was compared to price on their website and it was cheaper to book from search engine website. 
Boarding seems to be faster than similar airlines I have been on because they have the people in the back of the plane board first. This is not completely eliminate the annoyance of people blocking the isles because they do not turn people away if they board out of order. There were still people who sat near the front of the plane that would board first and they were not turned away by the boarding staff."

The economy class seating started from row 10 and i was seated at row 20. and the stewardess was serving from the front to the back, by the time when they were serving the food to my row, bibimbap was no longer available. So i have to take the other fish option which taste so bad. 

About 1 hour or so later, not wanting to trouble the stewardess, i walked to the back of the plane where the pantry was to request for water. Disgusted to say, THREE OF THE STEWARDESSES WERE EATING BIBIMBAP TOGETHER! So much about customer first. 

The choice of entertainment on board was limited too. what's worst was my seat's system was down. movies streamed kept hanging and have to restart in order to watch the movie.

However, the staff at the Incheon airport have to learn English.  The service at LAX and Manila were okay, telling people to line up at particular rows to board the flight; however in Incheon, since there was difficulty in English, staff could not explain that boarding of first class, business class, special assistance passengers and passengers with children came first; then economy passengers should line up according to seat number.  This created confusion among the passengers. But otherwise the planes had wide leg room; food was good and staff on board were helpful."

Asiana is a truly world-class airline, somewhat dwarfed by the likes of Cathay and SQ, but they take second place to nobody, in my opinion. The only minor negative is the Asiana Business Class loung at Incheon, which has some of the worst food selections anywhere. Not a nice place to have to sit for 6 hours bteween connecting flights!"

Was told by telephone reservationist that the flight was """"wide open"""" and I would have no problem making the flight. Got to Incheon Airport two hours in advance and was told to come back in 45 minutes after being assured I would make the flight. Arrived back to discover that there were no seats except in Business and they were not going to put me in Business or upgrade anyone from Economy. Because of all of these assurances and delays I missed opportunity to change to Korean Air flight. Not the kind of customer service I'm reading about from other people."

My flight was delayed several hours out of Honolulu. I was made aware of this when I checked in and knew I was going to miss my connecting flight in Seoul. I asked immediately if they could help me rebook prior to boarding the plane, I was informed that Seoul was not aware of the delay yet, and that they couldn't help me. I was told to call the hotline to see if they could help me, otherwise to check once I landed in Seoul for my layover. I searched to see what other flights would work for me so I had a list of connecting flights to give them. I called the hotline, and after being on hold for almost 40 minutes, was told that they couldn't do anything at all, that it had to be done at the counter in the airport. Fast forward to landing in Seoul- they had a ticket and map of the airport ready for me at the landing gate for my next flight. 2 problems, the ticket was for a flight at 2pm the next day. From my research, I knew that there were 3 other Asiana or alliance partner flights that night, and 4 before 10am the next morning, so 2pm seemed an incredible delay. Second problem was that because I was flying to China, the Map of the airport on where to go to get my hotel voucher was in Chinese. I don't speak Chinese. 

I asked at 2 different customer service desks about trying to get on an earlier flight, and phone calls were made, but I was told all the flights were full. Disappointing to stretch an already long trip over several days because of a delay on their end. 

However, the hotel was fine and included meals, the airport transfer to and from the hotel was fine, and the flight the next day was fine. I was disappointed in how long and how much extra time the delay cost me, but it was organized well."

There are some good options for food but they seemed confused when we wanted the appetizer from the western meal and the main from the Korean.  They were pleasant but confused.

I done plenty of research, read hundreds of reviews and couldn’t really find a reason not to try them. My main criteria was lie flat beds for the long flight to OZ. To be honest I wasn’t really sure what else to expect but was very pleasantly surprised by the complete standard of service they offered. The only business class experience  I’ve had is with Ethiad Airways who were superb, but the price this year was extremely high, hence looking for an alternative. 
If was going to be picky I would say that Asianas crew had limited English which on occasion caused a few minor difficulties, but nothing that couldn’t be sorted.Conversation outside of their service was very limited.
The business lounge in Seoul was disappointing considering this is there home city.And it certainly doesn’t compare to other lounges I’ve used. However to gripe about this is unfair as it had everything you needed and was satisfactory,but plenty of room for improvement.
On our return trip we had a planned 19 hour layover before connecting flight, I decided to view this as a bonus as we didn’t need to rush back being retired. So I was looking forward to getting off the plane and having a proper nights sleep and shower etc in the hotel provided inclusive of the price by Asiana.Also inclusive was an evening meal and breakfast and transport to and from airport. This was all provided and was satisfactory, but I do feel there is room for improvement and I feel this area let’s down the otherwise exceptional standard of the business class product they offer. Nothing major wrong to note, but just lacked the polish!
Staff were all lovely, food and drink great, standards of plane and cabin comfort very good, special assistance given for my elderly mother excellent.
Will definitely use again, my comments above aren’t criticism just observations where improvement could be made. They are constructive comments aimed at assisting other people who have never heard of this airline to make there minds up and to inform them of a few minor weaknesses.

1. Cathay has amazing lounges in Asia. The food spread, alcohol, restaurants, and comfort are top notch. Asiana? stale croissants and fried rice is all you get.
2. Cathay greets you on board with champagne, fresh water, freshly squeezed juice or signature drink. Asiana? greets you with nothing.
3. Cathay lets you seat where you want as long as seat is taken, take as many pillows/ blankets as you want. Asiana: better not try any of that. 
4. Cathay has cheese, fresh fruit, Nuhu pralines and fresh bread fro snacks. Asiana has ramen soup from a box.
5. Both airlines have fully reclining seats in business class. But Cathay's seats are far wider and newer, resulting in fewer people on board but more comfort per passenger. The entertainment selection is also larger and more up-to-date on Cathay- movies from 2017-2018 in 2018 vs 2013-2015 on Asiana. The TV screen is adjustable on Cathay but not on Asiana.

They helped with my carry on bag, wheel chair, and got me through all the security and to my check-in location for Asiana Air. When it was time to travel to my designated gate.  It was promptly done.  I was assisted to my seat and travel bag stowed.

I flew to Sydney, Australia via Seoul and had 6 hours of sleep on each flight, arriving in Sydney well rested.  The cabin flight attendants couldn’t be any more accommodating.  I asked that my lamb chops be done medium rare and they were.  The choices for dinner were numerous as was the wine selection.  The comfortable pods in business class were ideal for a good nights sleep, though in first class you get your own room.
Even though it was a long journey, the flight went by quickly and I was quite surprised that we were landing already.  I just had enough time to shave and brush my teeth.  In a previous flight in first class, I found the shower quite refreshing, I wish there was one in business class.  I highly recommend this airline in either first or business class."

Very impressed (hard though it is to be impressed flying economy). New A350 better than any similar sized plane I've flown before (and no shortage of overhead locker space). But the best thing is the service - helpful, attentive and never obtrusive. And the cabin crew don't barge into you as they go up and down the aisles if your arms or legs are straying just a few inches into the aisle (and if they did, they would apologise). Unlike BA & co where the customer is """"in the way"""". Would definitely fly Asiana again. They don't pretend to care, it feels like they actually do care.

( FL.602) to Seoul and then onto LAX (204) on 2/9/2018. The flight left Sydney almost 1.5 hours late, no reason given. We knew we would have trouble with the transfer to our LAX flight as we had gone from a 2 hour cushion to less than 20 minutes. Despite my asking for assistance, from Sydney ground crew, inflight attendants on Flight 602 to make sure we could get from our arrival gate in Seoul to the departure gate in Seoul and being assured that we would have this service,it never materialized. In addition once we landed, the ground crew had difficulty getting the gateway ramp to the plane delaying us even further. We were met by a man carrying a sign with our names at the arrival gate in Inchon, who told us to proceed toward the Transfer signs, but did not tell us the new gate number, did not speak English very well or understandably, did not offer to escort us and did not provide anything in the way of assistance to enable us to make our way. We had to go through a security check point and walk/run, carrying hand luggage weighing at least 50 pounds from gate 10 to gate 46 thru a maze of hallways without signage in English or any Asiana or airport employee assistance. My wife wit less hand luggage was able to run faster and made the gate just as they were closing the doors and asked them to wait for me. Fortunately they did and we both made the flight, but of course our luggage did not and we are still waiting for it.
I certainly understand and can accept flight and weather delays etc, but the total lack of ability to handle our transfer in an expeditious manner was very poor customer service. 
Fortunately, I was in good enough physical shape to make the 3/4 of a mile trip between gates, actually measured on my fitbit, without too much trouble other than needing to take some puffs of my albuterol along the way."

Seat, amenities all as you'd expect from a Bus. class cabin. The Lounge at Seoul (their flagship) was dark wooded, with faux books and not very much choice of food - disappointing.

Where’s my luggage?! You can feel the anger and panic of all the customers. After waiting in line for an hour they told us that our luggage is still in Korea! The luggage will be shipped to the address of our choosing in Philippines no extra charge. We went to our home in QC so sad and disappointed, all our gifts to our relatives were still in Korea.

I have no hesitation in saying Asisna rates above most and equal with the very best. 
The cabin was light airy and spacious and the seat as good as any of the pod seats available with other airlines. The pack, slippers and headset usable and adequate. The entertainment system only had limited films but they were current and high quality however limited in number compared to most other flights I’ve done recently
However the food was literally sensational with well cooked interesting menu’s catering for both western and Korean tastes. The were excellent too, well bslkNced and with good tasting notes.
The crew on each sector where incredibly polite, helpful and their attention to detail and presentation worthy of accolade- they worked hard to anticipate your needs and nothing was too much trouble.  I cannot recommended them enough. From check in to departure they where all so very helpful"

The flight attendants that I had to converse with had such heavy accents, I could not understand them. One gal had to repeat herself five times, before I gave up and asked for someone else to talk to me. The people we had to sit by were very rude. One fellow actually lifted his rear to pass wind in the direction of my wife.
 The lavatories were a disaster,one had fecal matter on the wall. And water or urine all over the floor.Paper towels scattered all over.
 We had a terrible flight and Seoul experience the last time we flew Asiana Airlines in 1989.I forgot that we had such a bad ordeal.But this experience is enough to stay with us for a very long time.

My trip to Tokyo late last year I said the lay flat seats were not perfect.  However on my current trip to Hong Kong
I found that this flight using the A388 was more comfortable. It did lay flat and the foot space was much roomier. 
So, I assume the aircraft has different seating designs despite the fact it’s regular LAX to Incheon flight. 
I use Asiana for 2 reasons, the cost!  It’s the most reasonable compared to the competitors crossing the pacific. 
However, if you’re not terminating your flight in Korean, be prepared for a long layover. I spent 4 hours in the lounge waiting for my Hong Kong flight.  Likewise my earlier Tokyo flight was several hours. 
Food and service is adequate but not great."

Usually great service, very good food, and they do have port wine (unlike JAL) which is my favorite libation. In-flight entertainment options are also very good and so are their many airport lounges.

Asiana Airlines does not have a lounge at Shanghai Airport (PVG) so they have their premium passengers use the Air China lounge. So we were there waiting for our flight to ICN on OZ368. Asiana personnel came through making a last boarding call for our flight and rushed us outta the lounge. I forgot my iPhone 7+ at the lounge and told Asiana personnel as I boarded the flight. They would not let me go back to retrieve the phone. I reported the phone missing then and there on PVG tarmac.

Upon arriving at ICN, I tried in vein to have someone assure me that I will get my iPhone back to no avail. Asiana is headquartered at ICN. The phone with its memory is worth a grand but it's open with no pass code and contains all my bank and travel programs information. Again, had to board the flight to LAX without my phone but used my wife's iPhone 8 to take our flight photos. Aboard OZ202, I also reported my lost phone and again upon arrival at LAX on Monday.

Yesterday had a knock on my door, lo and behold, FEDEX at the door with a package from Asiana LAX office that contained my iPhone! Thank you Asiana for the great service and for retrieving my phone!"

A few weeks before flying out of Chicago I ordered a Fruit Platter as a special meal. Asiana Airlines provides this free of cost. This is a great choice. You get fresh cut fruit made that day. This meal is perfect for an international flight. It is light and very juicy. This will help you stay hydrated and you won’t feel too full. You get your meal first before all others. Just make sure you tell the flight attendant your drink choice when the flight attendant confirms your meal. Otherwise you will wait for a drink as they serve the others. Most airlines offer this service but Asiana provides a lovely selection of fresh fruits. Please give this a try you will be happy."

Note - when you get back to Seoul you will not know your hotel until you get to the Asiana desk, get into Arrival hall and turn right, and desk is down to the left, we couldn’t find the desk so hope it helps. And if flying business you get complimentary transfer too. 

The staff are great are very helpful, they come and introduce themselves and try to make you as comfortable as possible, you receive your dinner menu nearly immediately with the drink list.

Choice of films are limited as well as the menu unless you fancy a Korean menu, as this was our first business flight it’s hard to compare to other carriers,

Full flat seating, really edible and individual food, wines etc, very very polite and attentive cabin crew all made for good, including red eye, flights. One minor negative, many of the inflight (in english) announcements were impossible to understand.

- I like the seats, particularly the 'honeymoon seats' for travelling with kids. Comfy.
- I liked being able to gate check prams - this is a big deal in my world
- Flight attendants were very responsive 

Cons
- Asiana seems to heat their planes to uncomfortably hot as a rule. I ended up getting a towel, pouring water on it and squeezing the excess out and draping over my neck and face. As a result I didn't sleep on an overnight flight

- food is nothing exciting and the meal service is way too long for an evening flight - lights weren't dimmed until 11.30pm. Do an express service with all components together then turn the lights off

Tip - don't lie the smartium seats fully flat. Keep a slight angle and waaaay more comfy"
11.9311189651489,9.79963111877441,"Inflight Aircraft Amenities",4,"This my chance to fly on a A380 from LAX to TYO via Incheon. I though this huge plane would have some extra special features in Business class. 
Business is upstairs so it’s a different entrance and exit door which is nice. 
Surprisingly the cubicles are about the same size as other business class airplanes (Boeing-777). 
Here’s the part I’m critical of. The lay flat was not flat. It was angled down. Worse yet the foot area was very narrow so your feet have to be close together. So it’s hard to turn from one side to the other, and you are constantly sliding down. 
So the experience was not what I expected. I was a little disappointed. 
Also the added area where they advertised a bar and social area was not functional. It was just an empty space. 
The service was impeccable. The food was good. They do have lots of snacks available. For some reason on these long flights I really get the munchies so that was appealing. 
Another drawback if flying Asiana is that you will have a layover in Incheon when traveling to Tokyo, Hong Kong, etc. it’s not that bad as their lounge is nice but you can add on 4-6 hours compared to a non stop.

The cabin was dated and didn't seem that clean, the staff seemed a little inconsistent and the food was terrible. We never expect great food on an airline but these meals on both legs were poor. We had a very tight connection in Seoul and we kept telling the Business Class team and they didn't seem that interested in helping. When we were delayed upon landing they seemed clueless as to what to do to help us. Most of the Business Class was making the same connection so luckily they had to hold the next flight but we did not feel like the crew was well trained in how to handle. Many of us were stressed and they just kept looking at each other for how to handle. Ultimately it all worked out but both legs of our trip were bumpy and the service was just very average.

With a little trepidation I set off. The first leg to Seoul was one of the best airline experiences I have ever had. Wonderful service, excellent food and very comfortable seat. Likewise, after a 3 hour stop in Seoul in an excellent lounge, the second leg to Sydney was equally superb.
Our return in January involved an overnight layover in Seoul. Asiana provided a wonderful hotel with transfers and all food, free of charge. Admittedly it took longer to reach home but the overnight in Seoul was well worth the additional duration of the whole trip.

I flew from Manila to Istanbul via Incheon. Flights were on time, cabin crew were attentive and courteous. I found the meals surprisingly palatable. Cabin slippers were also provided.

The long layover in Incheon is not a disadvantage for this airline. For the free Incheon transit lounge and free tours are very good -- from an economy passenger's perspective, that is. To avail of free tours outside the airport, just make sure you have a valid South Korean visa (if enroute to a final destination in the USA, a US visa suffices.)"

While both aircraft were older, and fairly worn interior-wise, that issue was the only thing the two flights seemed to have in common other than the chaos that seemed to embrace Asiana Airlines most of the time.   

We had a 24hr. unplanned layover in Seoul, due to a late flight from Korea, making the departure several hours late, and our connection to New Delhi impossible.  Asiana then put us up in an airport hotel, and provided meal vouchers.  That aspect was nicely done.  While the unexpected delay cost us some time at our destination, we did enjoy the time, and explored parts of Seoul.

I'll attempt to breakdown the various aspects of the flights for you in separate segments due to the immense differences in the flights.  Neither were what I would refer to as stellar in regards to business class travel:

Flight 271, SEA-ICN, Boeing 777-200

SEATS:  Pretty beat up for business class, and seemed rather small and confining for a lie flat pod.  Actually lost my dinner spoon in the side of my seat cushion, (a surprisingly large gap), and cut my hand retrieving it.  To top off the Smartium Business Class seat experience, it wasn't comfortable. 

IFE:  Older screen and system.  Remote control in armrest.  Very limited entertainment selections available, and nothing very current as far as movies went.  Quite limited as far as choices.  The IFE performed without gliches.  

MEALS:  After a slow service start, the meal was acceptable, (not as impressive as I had been led to believe it would be), however OK, but the service was the standout.  Spectacular. Multiple course served, great wine, fair appetizer (scallop), chicken or fish or beef for dinner, and a cheese and fruit plate for desert.  Baked goods and eggs for breakfast.  All good, not great.  

CABIN SERVICE:  A very slow start, but terrific afterwards.

CABIN CLEANLINESS:   Acceptable, but barely.  

CHECK IN DESK AT SEA:   Chaos.  Having a late plane, and trying to work around a planefull of missed connections has to be trying, but it wasn't handled well at all.  Extreme stress was the rule of the day behind the counter.  In the business class line, it took over 30 minutes to check our bags, and we were the first in line with many stacked up behind us.  

AIRPORT BAGGAGE DELIVERY AT ICN:  Really, really, fast.  Very impressive.  

Second flight, Asiana flight 767  ICN to DEL, Airbus 330-300  

SEATS:  Side by side.  Moderately comfortable considering the wider seat, and around 80% recline.  Not that comfortable by other airline standards, but OK enough.  Plenty of room  

IFE:   Very, very limited.  Not many choices in any category.  Disappointing tor an almost 9 hour flight.  

MEALS:   It was like a bad economy meal.  It was hard to believe in was even a meal that would be thought of serving in business class.  My wife asked for the beef choice, and they were out by the third row of business.  This flight was definitely a weird experience.  No arrival meal was offered.  Coffee seemed a task to get 90 minutes before landing.  

CABIN SERVICE:  Horrid.  If you were Indian, North American, or European, your service needs were secondary to others.  I haven't ever seen anything even remotely as offensive as this in any international flight ever.  We thought we were imagining it all in the beginning, but the situation kept repeating itself.  Unbelievable in this day and age.   

CABIN CLEANLINESS:  Acceptable.  

CHECK IN DESK AT ICN:   Quick, efficient, courteous.

AIRPORT BAGGAGE DELIVERY AT DEL:  Considering the vast amounts of people waiting for their bags at 3:00 am at the New Delhi Airport, the delivery time to the luggage carousel was quite good.  

There were nice aspects, and bad aspects to our experience of flying Asiana.  It was our first time flying with Asiana, and we had heard great things about their flights, but alas that proved not to be the case with us.  Maybe it was just bad luck, or a bad couple of days for them, or us.  Nonetheless, I don't think I'll be recommending Asiana to anyone I know.  There are a lot of ways to get around the globe for business or pleasure, and I think the competition will be my next choice."

The entertainment choices were only fair - lots of second-tier movies. Planes were older but were clean. Food was reasonably good but definitely not great. We ended up missing our connecting flight in Seattle and staff was helpful (after some encouragement) to rebook us on a different airline. If it would have required a little less encouragement, I would have added an additional star to this review. I've flown this route many times over the years, but this was the first time on Asiana. I wouldn't go out of my way to choose this airline again.

The high point was the layover in Incheon, S. Korea. The airport offers free tours if you have at least a 6-hour layover, and we took advantage of this by taking two tours, both of which we really enjoyed. You can search for """"free city tours Incheon Airport"""" to check them out and make a reservation."
10.9098653793335,7.1582670211792,"Asiana Flight Review",1,"this is my second time flying with asiana. for one, there were very limited flights going to lax from clark. first thing you'll notice when you book from clark is that there are longer waiting hours for the lay over at incheon compared to when you're coming from manila. not sure why they can't get you on an earlier flight to reduce the lay over waiting time since they have lots of planes going to lax.
next, delays are common. there was not a single inbound or outbound flight i had that took off on time. 
food was ok. not bad, but not excellent either. what i appreciate about it is they serve the meals in just the right amount of time.
their website is not user friendly at all. difficult to navigate and more often than not its too confusing to continue using. highly suggest they update their website to be more user friendly with the interfaces.
lastly, one of the worst comments on a review i can give, but this airline does not keep their word. during the return flight from lax to incheon during my first trip with this airline, there was a medical emergency for which the crew approached me if i could help a out fellow passenger. i assisted in stabilizing his condition and continuously checking up on him the whole flight. as a gesture of gratitude, the airline said they would put mileage points in my membership  account. 2 years later, and those mileage points still hasn't appeared in my account. i tried following up with them, but for some reason, they cannot be contacted all of a sudden. if ever a similar situation arises and they ask for my help again, i'd be very reluctant to accommodate them. 
now that i'm based in Manila again, there are more airlines to choose from. not really inclined to take this airline again. i hope there are airlines with much better service than this. if you're considering taking this airline, make sure you're expectations aren't that high."

Even before boarding the plane I was struck by Asiana's dated and largely unusable website, with its requirement for multiple registrations and passwords and its incomprehensible interface. Doing something as commonplace as online check-in was a chore, and I was completely unable to make a seat selection online.

Once on the flight I was treated with indifference by the attendants on this short-haul flight, notwithstanding the business class cabin being 2/3rds empty. They did proactively take my jacket to hang it up, which was nice. What was less nice was that they didn't think to return it to me when the plane was descending or after landing, which is what happens on all other airlines I have been on. As I was jet lagged after my long trip from Europe, I myself forgot about the jacket until I was in a taxi half way to my hotel. The hotel called immediately and a day later the answer came that the jacket had indeed been located. However, rather than offering to deliver it to my hotel - hardly an unusual thing for an airline to have to do - they said I could pick it up at the end of my week in Tokyo (not very convenient given the weather). If I needed it sooner, I would have to pay the cost of a taxi to have it delivered. Wow, Asiana, nice...

Between this and the longer flight I took on Asian from Seoul back to Europe a week later, I was left bewildered as to why the Star Alliance would want this airline as a member. It certainly is the worst long haul business class experience I've had on a Star Alliance airline (other than United, of course, which is garbage)."

I think for that week Asiana had brought in a bigger plane as they had large group bookings and hence they had a first class which is not a regular service and hence was not sold. That explains the upgrade
Overall I found the first class cabin to be brilliant, well designed and very private. The service was warm but not very bothering and I got a decent shuteye due to that"

The entire floor was set aside for business class, on the new a380.

Their flights are often delayed so the connecting flight gap time is so short that they would divert us to San Francisco then to Seattle. Instead of arriving in Seattle at 11am we would be arriving at 7pm. Ask then about options .... first is to take the two stop over which is INCH / SF or take the next day flight, so I said we would be willing to take the next day flight if they are willing to pay for our accommodation but no they are not willing so their is no option right!!!!!! And that was a week before our return to Seattle, w h at I did was call Asiana and after a long and arduous time arranging our return flight we had our tickets rebooked for the original time of our arrival in Seattle which was 11am. Lo and behold we arrived at the airport counter early and was instructed to a special line in another counter and they where insisting that we take the the flight through SF again oh was I livid!!!!!! I just said it is not acceptable for us and they should find a way for us to catch that Seattle flight from Inchioen Korea.  After a very long wait we flew with Korean airlines and was able to catch the flight to Seattle we originally booked for."

Checked fares and Asiana had the best prices and read good reviews. For long haul flights fly business. In every process from check-in, boarding, in-flight service, to transfer in Incheon could have not been more helpful. 
Seat was very nice, I choose window seat as it was single row and has extra storage. Food was very good and I selected Korean menu over Western. Food portions for me were perfect many American’s might think it was small.

I think business class had 38 seats 1-2-1 configuration. Center seat alternated each row from sitting next to each other with storage on aisle to separated with storage between seats. Also isle seat had small overhead bin above seat and large bin in center overhead.

The only two downsides for such a long flight was the selection of music and movies in entertainment system. For English language you had 2 movie choices, Hollywood (current movies) maybe 6-8 movies and Classic 12 movies. I remember one being “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. Music had different channels with was OK but tracks were only about 2 hours in length so you heard same music over and over. Digital music takes so little storage, why not 10 hours on each channel.

Second, plane was A380 (first time on A380) so superior to Boing counterpart. Problem was no WIFI.

11.4030694961548,9.31726932525635,"Asiana Flight Review",5,"So... never heard of Asiana Airlines before this... found some super cheap flights from Sydney to London via Seoul and decided to have a night stopover in Seoul along the way. Here’s my thoughts on Asiana if your thinking of doing the same...

Pre flight

Booked and paid online and all went ok, confirmations fine, became members, got a card, got their newsletters, chose seats online, checked in the night before online easy peasy. Running late to baggage drop thanks to Monday morning Sydney traffic, counter staff had great English and super helpful and quick. Calmer than us that’s for sure!

Flight

Boarding for A380 learnt a neat trick, Asiana have three queues based on seat numbers, so finding your right queue could save heaps of time, we literally went straight through and on via the upstairs queue! 

Seats for four in economy we had 74 J and K and 75 J and K, two in front, two behind. Window, seat, seat, aisle. Cool! Under the windows they had really big storage bays which were unreal, as I didn’t need overhead locker at all and used that for my backpack and gear.

The seats are not plush, but were fine and no problem. In fact the thinner seats gave me the big winner... heaps of legroom. With three of us over 6ft tall legroom is a thing... but not on this flight. Lots of room to stretch out. More than I can ever recall before in economy. Excellent. 

The flight itself was 10 hours and no dramas at all, on time.

The food and drinks on board are all Korean. The Bimibap for meal 1 was better than the chicken. The fish and pork options for meal 2 were good too. The Korean beer didn’t cut it! Cass? Pass! There were no bubbles either. Sad. The coffee was actually pretty good though.

Big tip. There is no snack buying option on board for chips or drinks. BYO and you’ll be set! 

The service from staff was efficient and polite. Brought everyone lots of glasses of water and soft drinks during flight. 

Online movies, games and phone charger worked well. They let you use your devices the whole flight too which was great.

Arrived on time, off the plane pretty quick, and baggage pickup went fine.

Overall a very good flight experience for a great price. I’d fly with them again, oh yeah... that’s tomorrow’s leg to London! 

And having a one night stopover to breakup the flight is a real winner! Just sayin’..."
9.03679275512695,5.93751001358032,"Airline Seating Review",1,"I have never experienced  the awful service starting with booking my seat on any airline domestic or international.   I am an older traveler who is temporarily  disabled which really shouldn't have anything to do with it but anyway I flew the 380 with the 1 2 1 seating.  I always  like the 1 primarily since I am a solo traveler.  My wonderful agent always books me that way but this time he wasn't able to.  I decided  to call asian a myself.  I got a runaround being told if I wanted one of those seats I would have to go to the airport because they don't allow it ahead of time.  Needless to say I was furious saying that this isn't sea that you have to get there early to fight for your seat although domestically  it is the best, this is first class which cost a Lot of money.  They refused and said call LA IN THE AM, LA said call Korea.  This went on 3 to 4 days.  I felt harassed.  Finally they gave me first row.  I asked if second was available,  I certainly would have understood but same story cant book you.  
Got to LAX look8ng at a 12 hour lay which I will never do again and the counter just closed but everyone was still there.  Wanted to check my 1 bag and again they refused.  As I said I am temporarily disabled  and what would I do dragging  it around so I decided to go to the lounge,  nope I couldn't do the either they wouldn't is She boarding pass.  I started to cry even the airport police and security officers felt bad for me.  12 hrs by baggage really.  Security Mr had to go to them and assist.
Overall flight was ok but first class cabin something kept banging as if someone kept opening and slamming a steel door.
I fly first class international  fairly often but this was a nightmare.  I asked the two other passengers if the experienced it they said no"
10.1502618789673,6.44422483444214,"Airline Seating Review",4,"It was our first experience flying with Asiana Airlines from Seoul to Sydney. The day we flew was the first day of winter in Korea and the heavy snow was falling on our way to the airport. We actually have chosen our desired seats before we departed from Sydney 2 weeks ago but when we checked in at the Asiana Airlines counter, one of our four seats had been taken by someone. The ground staff could not solve the problem and her English was poor.
Boarding time was delayed by half an hour and on top of that we had to wait for another 3 frustrating hours in the plane because the runway and the plane had to be cleared out from ice/snow.
But as frustrating as this was, we could not blame the airlines because it was the act of nature but it would be much better if passengers could spend the time in restaurants and shops at the airport rather than staying in the cabin for so long !
As a result of this, food was not served until late and everyone was hungry with dinner being served around 11.00 pm. Luckily, the bulgogi was good, served with fresh vegetables.  
Fortunately we were also able to swap seat with the lady who took our seat and sat four in a row. The aircraft is huge, clean and the seats are comfortable. Cabin crew are polite and helpful.
It was my second time having congee/porridge for breakfast but Korean style
I’m hoping that when I do fly again with them in the future there will be no delay !"

Plane is in pretty good condition, food is great!, staff is very attentive and always taking care of business, services are always clean! (That is a Plus), the only downside I found was...entertainment options!, unless you are fluently speaking Korean, you'll get stuck in a 16 hrs flight with 3 or 4 movies you can watch at. Other than that I would recommend this airline and most likely I will use it again."
6.41204452514648,6.69378280639648,"Flight Attendant Service",5,"Second leg of a Heathrow - Sydney flight, this deserves a separate review as the aircraft and cabin is, in my opinion, much nicer and has more modern and updated feeling, although the seats/ beds themselves are much the same as the Boeing 777, as is the service and food and beverages, which are all excellent. 

I sat in seat 10A, on the upper deck, forward business cabin. The cabin lighting is much calmer and less yellow in appearance than the Boeing 777. In front of this cabin is a small social area, with seating for 4, and enough space to gather with fellow passengers of travel companions, chat and stretch your legs. There are 2 toilets here, one of which is very large and great for changing outfits for the flight or arrival. I imagine it would be really handy for travelling with children or for less mobile passengers, or the needing assistance.

The audio visual system is controlled via a small touch screen remote, again located in the seat. This is much more user friendly than the Boeing 777 system. Earphones are the same and I couldn't hear any aircraft or cabin noise over them. 

Food and drinks service were all great, if similar in offering to the previous flight. The chicken breast main course was really good, and I couldn't fault any of the dishes. The Port was delicious, a 20 year old Taylors, and the Chardonnay was a lovely rich older style. The coffee with breakfast was also excellent. 

I slept like a dream and only watched one movie, during dinner and before falling asleep. 
Again the seats are as on the earlier flight, although were more modern in appearance and looked newer (less wear and tear). Pillow and quilt were the same and very comfortable. 

The only issue I would have with this flight was the cabin temperature, slightly too hot given the quilt etc. Pyjamas would be handy, but for the return journey I will pack shorts and a T-shirt so I don't wake up sweaty. 

The crew on Asiana really were excellent, and would rival and of the crew, in any class of travel I have flown with."

I was actually glad to have chosen Asiana for the reason that its layover is in Incheon Airport.  That airport is very good especially for long layovers.

I got a good/cheap rates with Asiana Airline that is why I did not expect high quality service from their end.  Overall experience was fine."
9.07742309570312,6.11183404922485,"Airline Seating Review",1,"Why am I paying for pains? There are 4 things that I am deeply disappointed with Asiana Airline. 

1. Numerous delays: 3 times. I had to cancel my Saturday dinner appointment. But it's okay. It could happen.

2. The world worst customer service at the counter: I and my wife's seats are separated. (When I have purchased two people's tickets at once, it's automatically and always assigned seats together for decades.)  And of course, gentely asked if we could sit next to each other. The only answer I received was that 'You figure it out. I can't do anything. This is how it is' . I still cannot believe. She moved our seats close. My seat was in front of my wife's seat. When I asked her 'what's going to happen next' she replied 'it's all up to you. You need to ask people around to change your seat'. I was like ' what about cabin crew? would they be responsible for this? """" She told me NO. And she asked me to take $10 voucher. This got me really upset. I was asking for her effort to put us together, no the cheap vouchers. I left the counter speechless. 

3. As I got on board, I looked for the manager if he could do any help for us to put together. I've waited for a long time and finally, he solved my simple request.

4. The airplane looked like 80s one. fabrics had its old smell, no touch screen, no USB ports, no nothing. Incredible. I haven't seen this old aircraft at least for 10 years. There was a box beneath my seat. and the metal corner part started hurting my foot. I didn't have any will to ask cabin crew to do something. I took care of it with my own bandage. 

The agent at the counter was like an old lady and her name is Seung-Hee Kim. I can't believe that Asiana Airline lets this rude service to customers.

Horrible experience ever. Never with Asiana Airline."

Very clean, spacious, mostly quiet except for one child having certain reactions at times (and the flight steward tried to help). Two items were given to every passenger: In-flight slippers, alongside a toothbrush with a travel-sized toothpaste. A thoughtful and very-welcome gesture.

Korean food such as bibimbap for lunch was delicious (with good quality gochujang and sesame oil) and well-presented, although the veggies did not fare so well when it came to the steamed rice selections with gochujang-flavoured beef or chicken for the second meal. Did not try the steak for lunch, so unable to comment on that. The mid-flight snack of a ham and cheese roll also went down well. I was very well-fed, and my hot water requests were quickly answered.  

Entertainment was slightly less varied than Cathay Pacific or Singapore Airlines, but still very decent. For the ticket price relative to overall quality experience if flying from New York to a Southeast Asian destination, this airline is better than those 2 airlines (IMHO, but YMMV). Asiana is one of South Korea's two main carriers, and provided a positively memorable experience with this aircraft.

Even though I was already at the boarding gate but had gone to the store next to it to look at Maui Jim sunglasses wonderfully-designed to truly protect the eyes from the sun in a stylish manner (and not easily available outside certain countries), the Asiana representatives at the counter later called my name alongside the gate number and flight number, to ensure I would reach the correct gate with enough time. Boarding was also quick. Flight took off on time, and landed on time. 

Notes: If you have any specific dietary requirements involving animal-free meals or not eating certain meats for personal reasons, check to see if special meal choices can be booked to accommodate your preferences, prior to buying a ticket."

I witness too on how Asiana staff responded to one Passenger that complaint of short breath that seems she has having a stroke so there were so many Passengers who volunteered to check the condition of the said Passenger.  Close to where I was seated even one passenger beside me volunteer to check and monitor the condition of the sick passenger and a lot of Asiana Staff were there to get what is needed and their respond and expressed concerns is very commendable and really excellent.

The amazing thing was there was power outlet to charge my phone during a long flight. Pilot was really amazing. It was a really nice taking off and landing. Flight attendants were really friendly and helpful. Some of them can speak Vietnamese, so it was really covenient for my mother when she needed something. Food was really delicious.

Arriving at FRA 4 hours before flight time, there was no one at the Asiana First check-in counter. So I went to the landside Luxx Lounge to chill. An hour later, I returned to the Asiana First counter. Everything changes to smooth sailing from that point on. The efficient and kind agent handled everything quickly and smoothly. Within 2 minutes, I was on my way to the LH Senator Lounge in Area B of Terminal 1. At 5pm, the boarding time printed on my board pass, I arrived at the gate. Showed the lady at the First Suite boarding line (no one in the queue at the time) my boarding pass, and within 1 minute, I was in the plane. As soon as I arrived at my seat, 3E, one FA, holding a few packages of OZ pajamas, asked me about my sizes. And I went into the bathroom to change right afterward.
Upon return to my seat, one of the FA was serving drinks already, and I ordered my favorite guava juice - delicious. Shortly afterward, they were serving champagne. Prior to the flight, I had read in Flyertalk that OZ downgraded their top champagne offering from Pol Roger Winston Churchill to Barons de Rothschild Brut. But I found the Rothschild just as tasty (in different ways, with different notes) as the Pol Roger, much to my relief.
The culinary offerings are fantastic, and I think the dishes on their Korean menus stand out more than the ones on the Western menus, with one exception, the caviar course, sumptuously presented with a mother-of-the-pearl spoon, blini, separately chopped egg yoks & egg whites and other scrupulously tasteful accompaniments - absolutely brilliant.
After dinner, an FA made the bed for me so I could catch up with some sleep. That's when I discovered one of the very handful shortcomings of Asiana's suite product: the bed really doesn't have enough paddings. Since 3F was not occupied, I just borrowed the blanket from it, increasing the padding and was able to sleep quite comfortably for a few hours.
As usual, the purser and the FA staff were wonderful: friendly, efficient, professional, poised and genuinely caring. Asiana should be proud of them.
11 hours passed quite quickly, and after a short break in the Asiana First Lounge at ICN, I would be ready for the sequel flight, ICN-LAX."

Due to my height, flying Economy class for long hours(in this case,about 12-13 to Korea alone and then another 4 to the Philippines) provides a level of discomfort that does not allow for a restful trip. In contrast, the level of service and attentiveness exhibited by the flight attendants is unsurpassed. Between S.F. and Korea, 2 complete meals ( and between those,snacks) are served. I recommend this airline for trips to Asia and the far Pacific."

I was advised there would be baggage fees, and I said, """"Fine, I was careful to weigh my bags, and they weigh less than 50 pounds"""". I was then informed that there were fees, anyway, and after weighing my 2 bags, they informed me my fees would be $720 US Dollars.  I'm like, No Way, and that's insane, and was told I could always ship my things.  I'm in an airport in Saigon, and I asked, """"Where would I do that?"""" and was told """"We don't know"""".   Then I was told I could either pay the fees or leave my luggage there.  It was a nightmare, and one of my worst flying experiences.

Coming after a 7-hour layover in the wonderful Seoul Airport where we were able to use the Asiana transit lounge, listen to chamber orchestra music, and do Korean handicrafts, it was superb.  The attendants were personable, the food and wine good, the seats comfortable, and the flight on-time.  At the end of 48 hours of travel, it was blessed."

I was impressed first by the very clear diction and slow, calm speech of the English speaking person who announced the flight. There was NO problem understanding what was being said, as can often be the case during international travel. Boarding was smooth and swift, and a choice of alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverage plus mixed nuts were offered while we waited to take off. The lovely, smiling flight attendants were professional, cordial, and truly attentive without being intrusive. A nine-course dinner and delicious breakfast, both delicious and served impeccably, left little to be desired. The lavatory was absolutely clean and neat each time I used it. All toiletries provided were in a nice, zippered kit of a higher quality than is sometimes the case, and the soft, comfortabe pajamas and slippers fit better than on other airlines. Not only does each First Class seat fold down into a complete iie-down bed, but each also has sliding doors to the aisle and a Do Not Disturb button that allow the passenger to have complete privacy, if desired. All seat and TV controls worked perfectly, and inflight wifi service was provided, including air to ground cell phone service (phone service is charged at $7/minute, but it's a nice option to have if you really need to reach someone when you're in the air). While we waited to board, the First Class lounge was beautiful, clean, and comfortable, and served a nice variety of free food and beverages. The flight departed  and arrived just a very few minutes late, but not enough to consider it """"delayed,"""" and baggage was delivered promptly to the carousel. The two improvements I would suggest are 1) a thicker mattress pad and pillow, to make sleeping on the seat-folded-down-into-a-bed more comfortable, and 2) cabin temperature was a bit warm for me for sleeping, and I could not find an individual fan to blow on me during the night.

The lounge in New York is the Swiss lounge at Terminal 1 which is only adequate and was very crowded when I was there.   The Business lounge in Seoul was very nice with a good food selection and a nice warm environment.  I was particularly impressed with the efficency of the boarding given that the A380 is so large - they station gate agents with signs to form cues for each class and premium classes are afforded their own airbridge which prevents the whole thing from descending into chaos.

After I called them several times, I bought the ticket on Expedia. After I purchased the tickets, I called them to raise a request, then they said I need to buy the cage in advance, in a certain size under their requirement, so I went to buy the cage and required information. Finally, I called them up again to raise a request again, they said actually they realized that they are unable to bring dogs into London and suggested that I should cancel the tickets. My mother called several times and all they said was that the only thing we can do left is to cancel the ticket and bare the cancellation cost(USD300). I am infuriated at how they give WRONG information to customers, make them take an action, and make them pay for Asiana's mistake. They did not apologize to me until I requested them to, and all they kept on saying in the beginning was go cancel via tripadvisor. I cannot describe how angry I am at them.

You really start appreciating Asiana's seats when you fly with LATAM before boarding Asiana's flight. LATAM is cramped with narrow seats cause of their 3-4-3 seats arrangement.

Staff very attentive, but this is Korean culture so I'm not surprised. Even when the flight is at night and the majority of passangers is sleeping, the stewardesses make rounds with water and juice in case someone is thirsty. They do it from time to time.

It is soooooo much better than any airline in the US that it is embarrassing. The level of service and attention to detail, the totally professional staff made of nearly perfect flight attendants serving you supersedes anything I have experienced on other airlines, and that includes Korean Airlines which is frequently ranked higher. Admittedly, my experience is in business class and I do not pretend to know anything about the economy cabin. One thing I do know, it is cheaper to fly from Honolulu to Southeast Asia on Asiana in business class - assuming you catch the lower fares calendar and plan ahead - than it is to fly business or first class from Honolulu to the east coast of the US. It's the seats, it's the flight attendants, it's the comfort of the ride, its the cleanliness of the restrooms, the toothbrushes, the combs, the mouthwash, the snacks at any time - noodles, sandwiches.

It's the wine, it's the ginger ale, it's the assistance with connecting flights, and the flexibility in meeting your needs.....they have never said no to any request that I have made, and i have made a lot of requests.  My last comment is that there are a few times in my life that I enjoyed flying so much on an airline that I was sad to deplane after arrival.

On my most recent trip from New York to Korea, business class on the A380, my fabric of my new Max Mara dress got ruined from contact with the velcro on the reclining chair. I provided proof of the dress tear and pictures of the seat that caused the fabric to get destroyed to Asiana customer service, but they are refusing to reimburse me for the torn dress. This is unacceptable service to a loyal Asiana customer who has provided valid proof and reasoning. I trust that I am not the only one who has experienced this problem, even if the problem may not have been voiced to their customer service department for a variety of reasons. I am thoroughly disappointed by this experience and will consider switching airlines for all future flights to Korea."

11.5134153366089,9.80677795410156,"Asiana Flight Review",4,"First, if you are flying to Asia from the US, avoid US flagged carriers unless... you can afford Business Class (or someone else is paying your fare). Asiana, like every other asian based carrier I have flown, is really good. Unlike US carriers Asiana, actually treats economy class passengers like paying customers. We recently flew to China, by way of Seoul SK, on Asiana. We flew flight 203 from LA to ICN (Incheon Seoul) and the return flight 204 back to LA. The flight is an A380, so it carries a lot of people and takes a while to load. We were actually about an hour late leaving LA, but the flight was right on time on the return leg. Asiana has economy seats on the upper deck in a 2-4-2 arrangement, due to the curvature of the planes body, and on the main deck which is 3-4-3 on the return. Asiana has a standard 32"""" pitch in economy, which is standard for most carriers, although United has 31 on their new 787's. Asiana does not offer an economy plus version. They do charge $100 extra for bulkhead seats that have extra legroom. their new A350's do have an economy plus section for about $100 more with extra legroom(but same seat width of 18""""). 

Since Asiana only operates 1 flight a day from LAX to Seoul, checkin can be a bit hectic at LAX. But they had plenty of staff available to answer questions and direct you to the correct counter/line. At Incheon, Asiana has tons of self-checkin terminals. Just scan your passport, and it prints the boarding pass. Then just drop your bags (if checking bags) and proceed to customs. My wife and I each checked a bag, and the attendant who tagged our bags gave us a pass for expedited customs. Using that line took only 2 minutes to have our passports checked, and be security screened. I discovered there are self-checkin terminals at LAX for Asiana, but they are few and not obvious. Returning to LAX, I used the Mobile Passport App from Customs and Immigration. Apparently few new about this app, as there was no one in the line and we cleared customs in 2 minutes! At the baggage carousel, lets just say an A380 carries a lot of bags in addition to passengers, and it took some time for our bags to finally get there.

Their flight attendants are friendly and helpful. During the flights the flight attendants circulate through the cabin offering water or fruit juice.We ordered red wine with our dinner, and when I asked for a second glass, the attendant brought it with a half dozen snack packets. They offer a choice of a Korean meal, or a western meal for dinner shortly after takeoff. And on the la to Seoul leg either a western or Korean breakfast about 2 hours before landing. Since the Seoul to LA leg arrives in the afternoon the second meal was lunch, again wither Korean or western. I opted for the Korean dinner, and it was very tasty. Although Korean food is usually spicy, the meal came with a separate chili sauce, so you could adjust the level of spice and heat. I have heard some complain that the Asiana seats are harder than normal. I am not sure this is true, but, anytime you spend 12 hours in a coach seat your posterior will get tired! 

Overall I believe Asiana is a very good choice for flights to Asia. They are not quite at the level of Singapore or EVA Airlines, but if you normally fly UA, Delta or American, you will be amazed at how well you get treated even in economy. Oh, the price was $847 round trip from LAX to Beijing(via Seoul), and Shanghai to LA(via Seoul) on the return."

The quality of food being served at the lounge was somehow mediocre. Flight attendants are very attentive and well trained to provide quality service. Shop online and pick up in the plane service was really convenient! However, it seems they spend so much time and energy to """"sell"""" duty free items."
8.59667110443115,8.38617706298828,"Asiana Flight Review",4,"Having flown a few times with Asiana Airlines recently, this being my first-long haul flight, I have consistently seen excellent customer service, even toward English-speaking passengers. I flew long-haul Heathrow to Seoul, then between Hong Kong and Seoul, and I am looking forward to my flight back to the UK soon.
 The food options were Korean when I was flying from the UK to Seoul, and between Hong Kong and Seoul. There was a western option available in both of my flights between HK and Seoul though. Drink options are plenty, and tea/coffee is served after each meal. It was nice and unexpected that a meal was served on just a 3 hour flight too. The food was tasty, comprising of a side dish, bread and butter, dessert cake, drink, metal cutlery, sauces (e.g. chilli paste for bibimbap) and ceramic bowls containing a meat-veg-rice-type meal. 
The entertainment on my long-haul flight was very dated, and the movie begun where the last person had finished, with no option to rewind! The quality of the screen was limited but I was surprised to see a few hollywood films that were released in the past year or so. I am glad I had netflix films on my tablet for the long-haul, and would recommend you bring options like this if you are big on watching films on flights, especially the 11-12hr ones! There is no wifi onboard any of the flights I had been on, but an option for onboard calls and aeroplane-ground was available for $1.50 or so. The flight between HK and Seoul however, had excellent entertainment, with a better resolution screen, better touchscreen capabilities and the remote you have to control everything was clearly newer. For every flight I was provided with average quality headphones, a blanket and average quality small pillow, and on the long haul flight I was provided slippers. No blindfolds for sleeping were provided however! The headphones use both slots for audio, so using my own earphones meant sound was only coming out of one ear, but this was surprising as it was onboard the newer aircraft. 
Generally, you'll find the decor very beige and not very modern, but I don't mind this so much, and for the main part of the flight the lights are usually dimmed enough to allow passengers to sleep. All of the screens have the option for the """"airshow"""" which allows you to track the flight and see weather/time conditions in the place of origin and the destination. Everything was available or repeated in English, and the staff also spoke very good English. 
Overall, I would recommend Asiana Airlines!"

On my flight home from Seuol to the USA on September 16th, I was denied boarding at the gate after I mentioned my disability issue to the gate agent and stated it should be noted in their system.   I was then taken to separate room that my GF was not allowed to enter ( she is a native Korean speaker) and my luggage was tossed, including my anti seizure meds. I almost missed my flight and was not given an explanation as to why.

My luggage and meds were not repacked and closed properly, I was just motioned to move on. I had to carry a half open suitcase and medical containers to the boarding area. I asked for a supervisor multiple times and was denied. I had doctors notes in hand, I ended up having a seizure during on the flight home.

Ok going back to the review- it was a fairly empty flight- had the whole row to myself and dozed off for an hour or so. Crew are very polite and nice- I like their red apron and of course, the attention to detail is lovely. Before boarding, one Chief attendant waits outside and welcomes you in and he does the same when you leave. I like how they employ both young and older employees- I'm never a big fan of an airline that discriminates against older workers- it is about service and not about age or looks. Duty free items and purchases and bookings are quick and efficient. You can make a pre-order and pay in cash or credit card later. Legroom and seat is comfortable- I wish my flight was longer. One more little detail that I like are the airline's vomit bags- there is a sticky strip where it can be securely placed unlike the ones in Chinese airlines where you have to fold it etc. Comfortable but far too quick- I sometimes wish I could just sit there for a day and not know where to go."

Korea to Bangkok.We had a 2 leg trip on the way back too, Bangkok - Incheon, South Korea and Incheon, South Korea - Toronto. We tried to upgrade on the way back too. But Asiana Air informed us they can only upgrade both legs of the journey not just one, so we asked the price of both flights being upgraded? To which we were told, even though they have premium economy and business class seats available, we can only pay for the first part of the trip with Asiana Airmiles (how would I have enough of those if any?), they don't accept cash or credit cards for an upgrade.
I don't know what type of plane it was, but when you sit in the seats your knees touch the back of the other chair. Service was OK although english announcements were rushed and hard to understand.
So when we got to S. Korea we immediately went to Aisiana Airlines Customer Service desk and were quickly sent away, with them saying that this leg is run by Air Canada and we need to speak to them instead. Air Canada tells us we can't upgrade through them because Asiana made the booking. After speaking to manager after manager over the phone the answer was clear. They can see our upgrade history from the way up and can charge us the same for premium economy, but they don't have any seats available. And they have business seats available but they don't know how much to charge us and therefore they would not sell the seats.

Full flight -wish it could be longer. Received the duty free items without fuss. Many people travelled with babies and they are well looked after by the crew. Excellent check in and tripods are allowed on board. One little rant: I like the packaging and design + attention on little things- the plastic cover to their food  has the slogan """" Expanding your horizons beautifully- it's more than a gloal network...it's a connection"""" accompanied by drawings of international landmarks...nice! It will be great if they can provide English Newspapers and get their flight crew to wear the Hanbok. PS: I wonder what brank of make up the crew uses- their skin looks great"

The meals are far better than other airlines and offer a choice of Western or Korean meals.  The staff from baggage check to flight crew are a pleasure to deal with."

They use a modern Airbus A380-800 on this route. Great seats on the upper level (2-4-2 layout). Quiet plane, great entertainment, delicious food for economy class and decent leg room for an average sized person (5'10"""", 170 lbs).

I have now been on two flights with Asiana and to be honest I found it better than Korean Air, now many of my Korean friends would be quick to argue with that but I found that the Asiana flight attendants were always going up and down the aisles making sure that everyone was ok. They were also very kind and it seemed to be genuine and not fake. The food was also very nice and tasty. As for entertainment their selection amazing (Turkish flights sometimes have like 360 movies to choose from) but I preferred the lower number because I wasn't overwhelmed by the sheer number of movies."

I was so surprised by this on a flight which I thought would have received particularly special attention, since it is heading to San Francisco /Silicon Valley.
Asiana is heading downhill, fast and their international marketing (esp for online, emailers) is very poorly managed.

Two long-haul and two short-haul flights with Asiana and everything was smooth. I sat on the upper deck on both of the flights from JFK to ICN and back. I highly recommend the last row on the upper deck as you feel less guilty reclining your seat (the recline was extremely generous) and you get an entire side cabinet all to yourself. Legroom on the A380 was fantastic, and so much more so on the older 747 and 777. Entertainment options across the board was considerably poor, there were only a few recent movies and basically no relevant TV shows. But I was lucky enough that they were actually some content I was still interested in, although not much has changed on the return flight so I literally watched the same movies on the way back.

Despite the poor IFE, what Asiana shines at (and most Asian airlines) is service. The flight attendants are extremely polite, helpful, and friendly. All of my requests were properly and promptly taken care of. On average, my service button was answered within ten seconds. Another thing that they excel at are the meals. All meals on all sectors were simply fantastic. These are meals that I would actually want to eat on the ground. The bibimbap as usual is fantastic, and so are the western meals that they offer. Snacks and drinks in between was available upon request 

Overall, a fantastic option if you're flying to Asia from North America, especially if you can get a seat on the upper deck of the A380. They are a very close second favorite international airline, right after Singapore. Fantastic service, great meals, and usually one of the cheapest options out there make them a no-brainer. Just bring an iPad or a good book for entertainment."

Saving a few more hundred dollars in exchange for a 20-hour layover in China was NOT in my plans, especially considering that I had my daughter in tow. 

The flight from Osaka to Incheon was seamless, and even with the short flight, a hot snack was provided and drink service as well.  The CA's frequently went up and down the aisles offering more drinks to those who needed it (definitely a plus, considering that I'm always using LCC's to get around Japan). 

The flight from Incheon to LAX was also similar, in that we had two full meals provided, and plenty of beverage opportunities throughout the flight.  The in-flight entertainment was good selection for both my daughter and I, as well as ample legroom for me to stretch out.  My only gripe, however, is that the bottom of the seats where you rest your bum are a bit flat, and so fatigue can easily kick in if you don't have something to support (extra pillow or rolled up blanket for the lumbar).  Other than that, we had a very pleasant flight going to LAX as well as returning back.  Couldn't be happier, considering the price:time value.  Will definitely consider using this airline in the future!"

However, we had one incident that ruined the rest of the experience. During our wait for our connecting flight from Seoul to New York, we had to wait from 5:20 am to 10:30 am. We were asked to check in our carry on before we left from Hanoi to Seoul because the flight was full, so we did not have any jackets to warm us up. Therefore, after unsuccessfully looking for a store to buy some blankets, I approached to Asiana Business Class lounge for help. Upon my request, a hostess brought two blankets but after finding out that I needed to take these blankets out of the business class lounge, she refused to let me borrow them. Because of the language barrier (she spoke very little English), all she kept replying was “sorry”. We understand the business class gets certain perks, but blankets are a basic need for a 5-hour layover.

When we sat down, they gave us drinks.  Honestly, I have never seen glasses that small before.  Two sips of OJ and then they took our glasses away.  They had a tendency to stay until we finished our drinks which made us uneasy.

While waiting for the plane to take off, during the delay, they didn't offer us any snacks or more drinks and yet we were in BC.   English is still a challenge to them.  There were times that we didn't know what they were talking about.  

The aircraft was very old and stinky.   And the food was not fresh (see pictures).  The attendants were generally friendly.

I do have some gripes, though: for a modern, sophisticated airline from such a technologically advanced country (South Korea), the lack of in-flight Wifi on all of their international routes is quite disappointing.

Additionally, the business class equipment itself—from the seats to the amenities kits—leave a little to be desired. They are not quite as modern, well-designed, or luxurious as one would expect. 

Ultimately, however, Asiana offers a great value for the money, and I would recommend it to international travelers who don't mind being without internet connectivity for extended periods of time."

Asiana Airlines have good leg room, comfortable chairs. You never go hungry on Asiana Airlines. They serve 2 meals and a snacks for my international long flight. They give free earpiece for the entertainment, a blanket, disposable slippers, eye cover, toothbrush & toothpaste. The flight attendants give exceptional service- They are nice, helpful, friendly, constantly going around asking if you want water,coffee,tea or juice during meals & in between.

On our flight to Seoul from Tokyo we were treated to a premium in economy seats. We didn't pay more than a hundred bucks for our flight yet we were treated to ultra wide seats and ample knee room (as a tall, burly man this was a huge asset after cramming myself into Asian sized sardine seats for a month).

We loved the airline then (it was a A330); therefore, we were excited that this segment, it was on the A380.  I must say their service has gone downhill from our last flight.  First of all, the boarding was not smooth in ICN (granted, this was a higher capacity airlines), as they would announce the boarding in unintelligible English so everyone was all over the place.  Once we got on-board, the crew was pleasant but the food was a big disappointment.  Those of us who opted for western food felt that the meat was bland and overcooked.  I had the Korean dish which was not good at all.  Their service was haphazard, where one side of the plane would be served completely and almost done with their meal and the other side just beginning to be served.  Granted it was a full flight, but I think the service was much better last time around.  In-flight entertainment was OK, I thought the selection of western movies were quite limited as compared to other airlines we were on during this trip (EVA, Thai, and even United).  The flight crew were all nice and pleasant, but appeared exhausted and tired was the best way I can describe the experience.  As for food, which used to be their strong point, is now their Achilles heal (at least on this flight)."

However recently this airline is going downhill by removing few quality of service to their loyal customers.  In flight service for business class is rather pushed over and following standard routines only rather than providing travel comfort suited to individual customers. They do not come to you unless you call them and it seemed like they are always busy with something but not really were attentive at all compared to other airlines.

Now all the long haul options are spicy, or unusual in some way -see my comments on chicken breast and cheesy potatoes served in maple syrup. Really?

On the return trip, the check-in agent informed me that the flight would be delayed by 15 mintues due to a “connection problem”; we ended up taking off an hour late. 
It was an old B777 and as soon as getting into my seat, I was informed that that IFE system was broken; no real surprise there. I asked about the charging port, and an FA said it would work when we’re airborne. You’ve guessed it; it didn’t. The attendant apologized that she was misinformed. After a mediocre meal, I asked for a cup of Americano, as the menu indicated there was an an espresso machine on board. You’ve guessed it; it didn’t work either.

I fly regularly with Asiana just because my company is one of their corporate customers. However, I believe they are no longer a 5-star airline. The sad thing is that they used to be good; what made them undergo this downward spiral in the past decade or so is anyone’s guess."

The aircraft as an A380 and the business class configuration was awesome. The overall space of the individual cubicle is sufficient and the lie flat bed accommodated my 6'2"""" frame with ease. The onboard service was great! The staff to passenger ratio was high this allowing for the level of attention I have come to appreciate but not expect in air travel. The food in both presentation and taste was superb. Finally the Asiana lounge deserves the high ranking accorded it.
Overall a wonderful travel experience thanks to Asiana airlines."

The flight from LAX to Korea is 13 plus hours, they served food an hour after the take off, and the gap between the next meal is 9 hours, so if you're diabetic flying with them, be ready to bring lil snacks or chocs in your bag coz even though you ask for a can of soda, the flight attendants wont give you any... On the contrary, the flight between Korea to MNL was awesome, great food were served since it's an over 4 hrs flight...Their lounge in Korea Airport was also a plus, free internet, shower, lounging chair, kid's playroom and a decent place to stay for long layovers...Another, upon check-in , I'm not sure if we were served with an unfriendly attendant or it's really the overall airline culture, but I hope they will have more accommodating staff since they offer services..."

Of course, when I attempted to call the China office, they were closed. This lack of quality service is unbelievable.

However, Asiana exceeded all of my expectations and more. We arrive at Sydney airport and the check in counter was a breeze. Although there was a line, all the check in counters were open, so we were moved through pretty quickly. Boarding was seamless and timely, and we had realised that we were possibly given a free upgrade to our own row on the upper deck of the A380. I'm not sure if it was 'Premium Economy', but compared to Qantas, Air New Zealand etc, the seats seemed way wider and comfier than regular economy, and came with complementary blanket, eye mask, pillow, slippers, ear plugs, toothbrush/toothpaste, bottle of water etc. Our row had plenty of side-bin storage which meant not needing to store our small bag underneath our seat. 

We were served two meals and multiple light snacks on the flight. The meals were of tasty quality. Unlimited drinks ranging from soft drinks to wine and beer during the flight, which we ordered any time we felt like by pressing the cabin crew button. Free mixed nuts/bar snacks with each drink. Entertainment system in seat had a wide variety filled with current stuff and classics. I didn't need to touch my ipad the entire flight. 

Staff to Passenger ratio was excellent, and we did not feel neglected or second rate at all, even when they were cleaning up tray tables after meal services. Toilets were great. Even when there was a wait, it was the opportunity to stand up and stretch the legs. 

Disembarking the plane was met with enthusiastic goodbye's and thank you's in Korean and English by the cabin crew. 

Having flown many airlines around the world, Asiana may not yet be quite the BEST in the world, but it is getting close to being up there with Emirates and Etihad etc. I know that it completely exceeded all of my expectations and it was worth every dollar of the great deal.

Here, they all are attractive, cooperate with each other, and are very active and seek to be helpful.  Unfortunately, this is basically one of those """"non English speaking"""" airlines.

On the flight to ICN, no wi-fi, no reason explained.  That's a long time to be out of touch!  On ICN-CEB, no electricity at seat, hence of course no wi-fi.  

Plus my reading light did not work.  At least 4 flight attendants involved themselves in this problem.  Mostly, they had crazy ideas, such as """"I will go and reset it"""" and turning on the entertainment system.  Finally, when we were close to landing, another one jiggled with the light--and made it work.  I couldn't have done that because I was in the aisle seat, though it was the most logical way to address the problem.

An old Korean man across the way complained to them that my empty Diet Coke can had spilled on his sock.  I told them I had nothing to do with it, but that if he wanted to sue me, that was fine.  I was hoping to fight him in the jetway, but no such luck."

I had no sooner boarded the plane when the flight attendant greeted me by name so as to know for certain I was the one who needed GF meals.

The only complaint is coming from the softness of the seat. The second sector Seoul to Bangkok was 6 hrs 30, and when your back hurt after 2 hrs it is not so good.
Despite this for an Asian carrier, I had quite a lot of room leg. Normally my knees touch the front seat. The service was good, and catering was ok."

I had to follow up, drive down to the airport twice, write letters, call the offices repeatedly to get any action. Asiana Manila was not able to call internationally to Seattle b/c they didn't have long distance service.

These seats are, in fact, very, very uncomfortable.  The seats are NOT bed-style unless your bed is like an ironing board sloped at a 30 degree angle!  We heard other people complaining about how bad their seats were and how they could not sleep or rest due to how uncomfortable they were.  The biggest reason the seats are terrible is that you feel like you are always sliding down towards the floor since the semi-flat seat slopes at such a noticeable angle, even with the foot rest deployed. These expensive seats made our 5-6 hour red-eye flight to ICN very memorable, for the wrong reason!

The cabin crew hit it out of the park with the service: efficient and with the utmost respect and politeness.  They always had a smile.  I went with the Korean meal selections and the dinner was fantastic.  But probably should have gone with another selection for breakfast as the Korean rice porridge was only so so.  The upper deck business class of theA380 comes with its own """"social area"""", although I didn't see anyone use it.  One of the bathrooms was also extraordinarily large.  Seating was also very comfortable and did not feel as cramped as the EVA business class seats.  However, I have to give EVA the edge in terms of the flight amenities kit.

The food was good for the first meal but horrible for the second meal. On the return flight, the plane was much older without any power plugs, the video screens were old, small and hard to see; both meals were poor and one of the toilets failed. To top it all, the return bus ride had too many people and too much luggage for the return bus ride. To avoid safety issues with kids on people's laps due to the overload, we offered to rent a car to go back with the expectation that we would be reimbursed (yes, we should have asked about this before but after being up for 18 hours and with a 3 1/2 hour ride left to go, you can understand that this was not foremost in my mind with a daughter and a wife in tow).  Since then, we have got nothing but a run around--no support by the travel agency (Am-Pac Travel in Lakewood, WA), Asiana who contracted the bus service has been of no help and the bus service has simply made excuses.

Left Chicago O’Hare during a snow storm (in March), the plane had to be de-iced. A new one for me.  My seats were all booked by the wing. Could not even feel the take-off. Very smooth. The meals were all Korean and quite tasty. I can eat anything, so my opinion of the food may not be helpful. I am grateful to eat and when in a foreign country, do as the new country does.  They had water, coffee, green tea, beer, red & white wine and soda. We took the midnight flight, we were given pillows, blankets and slippers. The bathrooms were clean and not smelly, equipped with toothbrush and paste, cups to rinse your mouth, and after a 12 hour flight we needed to freshen up. We finally arrived in Korea at 4:00 am for a 4 hour layover. Customs and security went very smoothly. Don’t carry anything in your pockets, easy to remove shoes, have your passport and boarding pass with you and all will go well. I made sure to do my homework on what I can bring to Japan and since I take medication, I contacted the Health Consulate of Japan in regards to my medications. I copied everything, separated the prescriptions into baggies in the original container, along with my ‘OK’ to travel  RX papers from the Japan Health Consulate and all went well. No search, very kind, non-invasive during the x-ray scan. I’d rather security and customs be extra careful on my account. Getting back to the flight. Took off from South Korea to Tokyo Japan.

The Asiana Lounge was quite crowded, even though it wasn't small. The way they have arranged the seats made me feel like I was in a classroom. Food selection was acceptable though not fantastic, with 3 hot dishes, salad bar, and snacks. The staff were not prompt in ensuring that there were adequate glasses for drinks, and the shelves for glasses were mostly empty on multiple occasions. I wanted to have a glass of wine but there were no wine glasses (or any other glasses), and I asked the staff about it, and she suggested I use the paper cups (which was provided for water) instead!

I went to the boarding gate about 10 minutes before the stated boarding time, and waited, and waited. By the time the original departure time has passed, we were still sitting and wondering what's going on. Many people approached the service counter and asked about the flight, and apparently the aircraft had some problem that they had to deal with and they were still waiting for the maintenance to complete. However, there was no public announcement, and even the departure status boards still stated that the flight was on time.

Finally, about more than an hour after the original departure time, they put up a notice at the service counter stating that there will be a change of gate and aircraft and a new departure time. But even at this time there was no public announcement! Most people only realized that there was a change after they approached the service counter and looked at the notice.

We eventually boarded our flight about 2 hours after the original departure time (at the new gate)! 

I was pleasantly surprised that they upgrade me to Business Class (I flew Economy on the flight here and was not impressed with the seats and service), and looked forward to a better experience.

Their Business Class seats were more roomy (than economy, and this was expected), but the seats control was not well designed. I wanted to lower the seat back, but that caused not only the seat back to be lowered but also the seat itself to be raised (it's probably the way the internal mechanism worked); I took a while to get used to it.

The service in Business Class was good. The flight attendants were friendly and prompt in their service. In Economy Class (on my trip here), they kept speaking to me in Korean, even though I have already indicated multiple times that I don't understand Korean. Here in Business Class, they managed to remember that I don't speak Korean and started speaking to me in English after the first contact.

The food was great too! The beef steak I had was actually tender and nice.

Entertainment options were still limited. There were about 10 English movies available and they were mostly old ones; only three were recent enough.

Overall, I would say the service was good in Business Class but there were lots of room for improvement in other areas, especially they way they handled delayed flights."

This was an overnight flight, supposed to depart at 10:40pm but they delayed it because the flight from Incheon was delayed.

The boarding announcement in Singapore was done first in Korean and then in English, which was inconvenient, because the Korean version somehow took longer than the English version, and those who understood Korean already acted upon the announcement.

The seats were rather narrow, and the legroom was quite limited. Being an overnight flight, I was unable to sleep at all.

The entertainment options were really limited, mostly older movies.

The flight attendants were cordial enough but not exceptionally friendly.

After 30 minutes from eating he felt like vomiting and dizzy. I told him to go to the restroom and on the way he fell down but we catch him with the help also of the stewardess. They call a nurse right away while he lying down unconscious. When he recovered and felt better he proceed to the restroom and have an unfortunate event. The Supervisor assist us right away by commanding the stewardess what to get and have everything he needed to change his clothes that they provided from the business class and a lot of hot face towels, because our luggage are all check in. They asked our seat mate to transfer, so my husband can lie down. Supervisor and stewardess were checking on him every now and then."

5.82570123672485,9.99002075195312,"Inflight Aircraft Amenities",4,"This review is geared more to the new A380 double decker jumbo jet then the airline. I usually fly Asiana when I go to Asia (miles, price etc.). Ok, the plane is big, so keep that in mind when you fly on it. It's like having double the passengers in one plane. Having said that, know what comes with it. Almost double the time getting on and off the plane. Double the time to claim luggage at baggage claim, same for customs and immigration when travelling international. I noticed all the major airlines that fly over the pacific are starting to use this model of aircraft. 
Things I likes about the A380, more space in the seat and leg room (compared the 747 & 777). Entertainment center had a large screen...plenty of movies, each seat had usb charging port and 110/220V charger at the base. Dislikes, the over head bins left and right side of the plane, upper deck were very small! Shameful! If you have a large carry on it won't fit. The lower seat cushions were very thin. I felt they were cheaply made. The 747 & 777 have better seat cushions, but less space. I have always loved the 747, but that's a personal opinion. So when taking Asiana or any plane from the west coast of the U.S. to Asia, check the plane you will be flying on. Both of my flights, inbound and outbound to LAX were delayed due to flight connections. I think (totally speculation on my part) the fight times were delayed was due to so many people being crammed on to one plane, any other connecting flight would hold back the A380. I will have to consider a different airline next time I go to Asia because of the people, flight delays and luggage/customs delays. If you plan on delays, then its ok. Food on the airline was ok."

We used four flights during our travels and the level of service, cabin standards, food quality and entertainment was perfectly consistent. I do not mind basic facilities if cleanliness and consistency of experience are met. And in this case they were. The food is better than most airlines with a good variety of dishes on long haul. Some people complain about the lack of entertainment options but really people do you need more than 20 movie options per flight. This would have been a five star review except we were delayed both ways by 20-30 minutes due to cleaning staff being late in turning the plane around between flights. Not sure if this is Asiana issue or not but it did disrupt our flight experience. Lastly, the price of the flights were extremely reasonable for the level of service provided."

No big flight delays, food was actually good but the ride itself could have been made more comfortable especially for people who are not typically Asian built. My companions found it especially cramped in the leg room area and if you are seated beside someone hefty then expect him to """"spill over"""" a little bit and encroach on your seat space."

The seat was very uncomfortable. It is a small seat and if you are tall as me (I am 6 foot 4 inches) you are hitting your head once you want to lay down and the upper seat goes down.
Service was sub par as nobody had a smile on their face and if you asked for something you could feel that they did not want to bring you anything.
The worst was the heat on the plane. They """"cooled"""" it down for me to 26 degrees C. This is horrible. Last flight with them."

Asiana was by far the worst of the 8 international first class services we've used. As a quick overview the food was bad, the catering terrible, and the service unbelievably awful, resulting in a long and unpleasant flight which should have been enjoyable.

The first class lounge before the flight was like a low-end business one with mediocre and minimal food, and a loud waiting area above and open to the busy terminal. A bad lounge compared to others, but we were saving our focus for the flight itself so weren't concerned. In retrospect this was the best food of the experience. 

Dinner service is when things starting going downhill quickly. We had preordered meals, which were not at all as described. They were bland and left largely untouched by us but for a cursory taste of each item. This should have been no problem as normally 1st stocks lots of options, but it was not the case here. It seemed like they didn't have any other choices, all the other meals were either 'already ordered' or not on the plane. This is in a small cabin that wasn't even full! It could only have been a case they didn't get the food loaded properly on the plane. They didn't even have cheese...

Six hours before landing (4:30am) when all passengers were sleeping, two of the night staff, eventually joined by a third, made themselves cozy in the empty first class suite immediately in front of us in row 1. For more than an hour they had a loud conversation that included laughing and woke everyone up.

With everyone awake, we started ordering breakfast, which were denied as """"they weren't ready yet"""" (first class is supposed to be dine on demand), and asked to wait an hour, which ended up being more than 2. They offered to prepare the 'anytime' items, which for this flight were just Korean soup and ham sandwiches, which we declined. When breakfast eventually came it was better than dinner, but still only a business class level at best.

This is very much a 'first world problem' scenario, but these flights cost over 10k. Most business class experiences are better, and I have even had better food, wine and service on one Air France economy flight. The only way this was first class was the seat with a door, and champagne (but Rothchild, not Dom or Krug). When service was not ignoring the passengers (water was never refilled even once unasked in a 15 hour flight), it was telling us didn't have what was on the menu or preventing us from sleeping."

The entertainment was worse than most airlines provide in Economy - mostly really old TV shows and very old movies.

The first leg was delayed taking off due to a late arrival. Since the aircraft was also the second in our outbound trip it was delayed taking off from Seoul being the crew did not make up the time of the delay.

Return trip we were again delayed taking off due to late arrival of the aircraft. This time we changed aircraft in Seoul but even this flight was delayed taking off.

I have flown Asiana just this one time and that is 4 delayed departures and arrivals and that is not at all a good track record!

All aircraft involved in this trip were old and way out dated. Not one had a power outlet to plug in phone or laptop. It had the old style split prong headphone adapter meaning I could not use my own headphones. On the return trip the monitor was an older style smaller screen poorer video quality.

Return trip both aircraft had a box under the seats so this ate up a good chunk of my foot space and is not at all acceptable and on top of the the return aircraft leg room was just down right horrible! I had to pretty much site spread legged just to find any sort of comfort otherwise my knees would have been buried in the back of the passenger in front of me!

Services on the aircraft were also not very good. While the crew was acceptable the services offered were not. Most the time we were only offered tea, coffee or water and occasionally Orange Juice. The longer of the legs (Seoul to Singapore) we did have some soft drink and other juice options. but even state side most airlines offer soft drink and juice options even on shorter flights unless just to short for services. So on 2+ hour flights to have such limited services is not at all good.

Food the shorter legs were not good at all food wise in fact I left half my lunch from the return trip from Seoul to Tokyo as the food was very mushy feeling to it and not very appetizing. Now the longer legs from Seoul to Singapore and reverse leg were much better in regards to the food. These legs were perhaps some of the best I have had on any airline as of late.

They do not automatically arrange it for you. However, there is no problem. Staff were most helpful in making the booking.

When arriving at Incheon I was told to follow the 'GREEN TRANSIT SIGNS'. You DO NOT need to do this. IF you do you will find yourself in a room zigzagging hundreds of people to take onward flights.

This is what YOU ACTUALLY DO. 
1. Make sure you have a confirming letter from Asiana Airlines acknowledging your free hotel.
2. Line up at Passport Control with your passport and the confirmation letter.
3. ON the incoming information card received on the plane - you will find a question to state your address in Seoul. I put 'Asiana Airlines transit hotel' as you at this stage do not know where you are staying.

My seat 10H was just behind the Business class bulkhead at an additional charge. Though the seat was comfortable itself once the business class curtain was drawn the 
area became uncomfortably hot. I often walked to the back of the aircraft purely to 'cool down'. The problem as I see it is that the area above the curtain is blocked so air cannot circulate through the cabin. Consequently, that area becomes quite stifling.

The staff, serve meals and drinks together, but over the long flight between Seoul and London only twice did they walk round with water or juice. Once the food is served and cleared staff disappear. They are proficient but not particularly friendly.
For such long flights the entertainment choice is extremely limited with old movies or documentaries. 
IN Seoul we sat on the tarmac for over 45mins because Chinese airspace was too busy. If Asiana schedule flights for that time why not change it to save the inconvenience.

When I got to LAX, I was happy to easy that they had a kiosk wherein I could print my boarding pass and ticket bags. However, as I was few minutes to finishing up, my passport couldn't be scanned. No one was available to help, unlike the other other kiosks for Eva Air and other airlines. My day kinda turned around because she checked in my 3rd (carry on) bag for free. Then the waiting time began. After about an hour of waiting, we were told to move to another gate. Then 10 minutes into our actual boarding time, we were told the the boarding is delayed by 25 minutes. Then the 25 minutes turned in an hour! This was tough for people like me who had a connecting flight to another country. 

On my return flight, we delayed for an hour initially. Then when I came back to board, we were delayed for another 45 minutes. The food is just okay and the bathrooms didn't run out of essentials. The entertainment choice contained classics and new releases. 

Asiana Airlines won't be my first choice but given the right rate, I won't mind booking with them again."

Chicago to Korea then to Thailand and back home is 4 flights and everyone of them delayed by 2hours or more!  No over airlines have or had delays.  I fly a lot and looking at there delay times for the year there not bad so I'll chuck this up to bad luck. 
Let's talk about why you should fly Cathay or Korean air.  Asiana has outdated TV entertainment for when in flight and unlike the other big airlines they have No!

Seats - Comfortable, Angle flat
Food- WOW! They feed you so much that by the time I landed, I couldn't eat another bite!

The only complaint that I have is that Asiana seems to move your seats from what you originally purchased. I don't like that, and this is Business Class! I'm traveling with my mom and my 2 kids (15 & 17) there's a reason why I chose the seats a certain way, I was not happy with that! Even if they changed the model of the airplane that they plan to fly, they should still keep the seats in the same configuration that I originally purchased, instead of moving us around. Example: I originally got seat 2A and 2B & 3A and 3B, so that we have a window and aisle seat, instead they put us as 1A,1B 1C and 1D, so only 1 got window seat, the rest were aisle seats. No warning and no notice, it wasn't until I was checking in did they tell me that they changed my seating arrangements. I purchased my Business class tickets in June and my trip was in December! I gave a big fat ZERO for that!

The inflight entertainment offered a bare minimum of choices and insufficient to entertain for a long haul flight. 

Due to a 5 hour delay departing New York I missed my Seoul to Bangkok connection. The best that was offered was another flight 24 hours later, Asiana claiming that there was not one seat available earlier on their airline or within the Star Alliance network. A quick internet search revealed many available seats, but trying to reason with staff was pointless as they lacked the intelligence to have a grain of compassion. A fellow passenger who uses a wheelchair and travelled business class was treated with the same level of dismissive arrogance by staff who have the personality of a rock. 

Requests for earlier flights to Bangkok were met with robotic responses. Is it any wonder that South Korea has become a world leader in automated systems design, for necessity is the mother of invention. An actual robot would have performed better than what Asiana pass off as service staff. 

Ultimately, 5 hours of delayed departure, 15 hours flight, 24 hours layover in Seoul and a final 5 hours to Bangkok. Total 60 hours and with not so much as a pair of socks offered as compensation. Trying to complain serves no purpose as their response only adds injury to insult.

I slept on a bench because there were no hotels available to book less than a week out from Christmas, and the airline offered no hotel or assistance of any kind.

Their business class from Jakarta-Incheon (CGK-ICN) was more or less ordinary. Nothing impressive but the flight itself was fairly smooth and I didn't experience any flight delay.

Although the aircraft they were using appeared to be quite old but it was well maintained. The drawback was they didn't serve dinner during the route CGK-ICN. However, the plus point flying with Asiana Airlines was the fact that I was able to join (free) city tour once I reached Incheon International Airport. The tour staff very helpful as she guided every one to the immigration and in my case, in less than 20 minutes, I was sitting close to the counter waiting for the group tour to be departed. I did the same exact thing on the returning flight LAX-ICN.

In flight food was acceptable although it was not great. However, I didn't really like selection of in-flight movies since there were not many good movies to watch for compare to the ones in Thai Airways or Singapore Airlines.

The same business class product is also deployed on Asiana’s long-haul 777-200 fleet. 

Seats:  The 180 degree fully-flat seats are arranged in a 1-2-1 staggered layout with each seat featuring direct aisle access.  With the staggered layout, the arrangement of the “1” and “2” seats vary from row to row.  So depending on your traveling priorities and whether you are traveling solo or as a couple, you should consult seatguru to find the seat that suits you.  I had a seat close to the window with a shelf between me and the aisle; this is the type of seat which offers the most amount of privacy.  I thought the seat was very comfortable in all positions and  found the width and length of the seat / bed to be adequate (I am 6’1).  The seats, however, may be a little narrower than the reverse herringbone seats found on some other Asian carriers (such as Cathay, EVA and China Airlines).   Being on the upper deck, there are sizable storage cubbies underneath the windows, which is a plus. 

Meals and Services:   The business class was only about 30% full at most, so things felt wide open.  Upon boarding, the pursuer came to introduce herself. The flight attendants were very friendly and attentive throughout the flight. They always had a genuine smile when interacting with the passengers.  Two meals were served on the flight, with a good wine list.  For the first meal, I was looking forward to having bibimbap.  However, the Korean option featured a beef dish instead, which I found to be somewhat disappointing.  It was essentially a big bowl of seasoned white rice with thistle, a few slices of grilled beef and vegetables, and some typical Korean side dishes. As much as like rice, I could not finish that huge bowl of rice.  For the second meal, the Korean porridge option had already run out by the time the flight attendant took my order (I was away from my seat when they started taking orders).  So I settled with a pesto linguini with shrimp dish – not bad but nothing special, a little oily.  During the flight, I ordered a spicy instant ramen – it was presented nicely in a big bowl and came with a couple side dishes – I think I enjoyed the ramen more so than the other regular meals. 

Entertainment:  Prior to my trip, I had heard about Asiana’s entertainment selection being somewhat lacking, and indeed it had a smaller selection of movies, music and TV shows as compared to some other carriers.  Still, it had enough things to keep me occupied while I was awake.  The user interface was good and easy to use, and the screen resolution was good. 

Amenities and Extras:  This is probably the category that I believe is the most lacking   The amenity kit is pretty basic, and Asiana does not offer pajama (which is fine as I brought my own).  However, I was surprised to find the pillow and headsets to be basically “economy-class standard”.  The pillow was very small, and the headset was flimsy and of low quality.  On some other carriers, even premium economy passengers get some type of noise-canceling headsets.  Also, the Asiana A380 seemed pretty austere and there was no walk-up bar or snack spread set up for the flight.  There is a small lounge with a sofa in the very front of the aircraft upper deck, but there is nothing special about it and it was empty when I visited there. 

Summary:   Overall, I had a pleasant flight – comfortable seat, fairly empty flight, nice cabin crew and on-time arrival.  Bu with strong competition from other carriers, Asiana should try to step up its offerings of amenities and the various “little things” that can elevate a good flight to an excellent flight."

In flight entertainment, yes it may not be as modern or responsive than other flights, but it was still great and did what you needed which is to entertain you on a long flight. 

Food, now this I was impressed with, two options usually, Korean or Western, I always opted for Korean, felt very fresh and was also quite tasty! You were given ample amounts of food, and drink throughout the course of the flight. Also my girlfriend is vegetarian and she was given good vegetarian alternatives to the Korean meat options.

Lot's of lounge choices so I tried Singapore Kris Lounge at HKG, a nice offering but nothing Mind Blowing. A bit of a hike to the gate. Once boarding began it went smoothly with Suite Customers taken first. Suits were lovely with the door open and partition up, but awkward with the partition down. I found my next door neighbor a bit off putting. Flight attendants were polite but not overly warm on this flight. Since it's a short middle of the night flight, the meals consisted of an upscale gruel that is popular in Korea and tastes pretty good. Once airborne they got the meal out quickly, got my partition up, and when I was ready closed the door to my suite. It felt a bit too enclosed at first but I was tired and slept well till wake up call prior to landing. Some nice juice and coffee to get the wheels turning.

Skip business class and take the stress out of flying by cocooning yourself into your private suite and let the world roll by under you. 

Asiana still offers a true Asian first class service.  The attention to detail is evident at each point of contact from check-in to deplaning. 

I shuttled into JFK on a cramped Jet Blue connecting flight.  I was able to interline my bags to Bangkok but Jet Blue failed to tag my bags as priority.  Asiana check-in staff in Nee York remedied that oversight. It was important to me as I had immediate need of my bags upon arrival in BKK which I had planned for. 

The one black mark on my Asiana first class experience was the unavailability of a decent airline lounge prior to departure.  At JFK, Asiana uses the Swiss Air lounge which offers few amenities in their business class lounge.  The Swiss Air first class lounge doesn't open until 2pm? Which is after the Asiana departure. 
In flight, I enjoyed enough real estate in my private cabin to stow everything I needed for a comfortable and long flight.  There are small lockers at your seat (which on Emirates holds a mini-bar hint hint Asiana) which are deep and empty so I could stash my books, laptop, travel pillows, Bose headphones, etc.  Asiana provides Bose headsets to go with large screen video system.  The hand-held video control device was annoyingly difficult to use. One needs to be a video gamer to scroll monitor to lock in on desired entertainment options.

Kudos to the excellent service and seat comfortness to make up for the lousy entertainment."
11.9935436248779,9.66891574859619,"Asiana Flight Review",3,"Of course Business Class is going to be better than Economy and an Asian carrier is better than the Western competition but when you know your business classes and compare Asiana against Singapore Airlines, Japan Airlines or any of the Middle East carriers, the product is decades behind the competition. 

I flew Tokyo to Sydney via Seoul. I booked it months in advance and was looking out for the new Smartium business class to be scheduled for my flight. I got lucky but it was a bit of a disappointment. Asiana flies some old 777-200, many with a business class from the '90s with a 2-3-2 configuration and sloping seats. Smartium is their new product in a staggered pattern but only randomly on the Sydney route which you'd think is a premium route. Leading up departure, the aircraft changed about 4 times for both my connecting and onward flight. This required a seat change each time.

This is getting into the weeds of detail but if you know your business class, this will mean something:

Lounge - horrendously crowded and not one place to sit. It's the only Star Alliance lounge in Seoul (exc SQ) and also welcomes Emirates and Qatar Airways passengers - way too crowded and a dismal selection of things to eat. Cold spaghetti salad anyone?

Check-in at Narita - waited 15 minutes - only 2 people doing check-in. Not good. 

Smartium business class seat - solo seat and direct aisle access appreciated but this is the standard now for international business class. The seat is very worn out with tape holding bits together for my seat. The cushions are completely worn out; the aircraft is otherwise clean.

Meal - overly elaborate service for very simple food that could be served faster, especially for a night flight. Food is very boring and rather average. I had the 'western' option which was actually a Chinese sweet and sour fish with sun dried tomatoes (?) and fried rice. For some reason, the soup and salad for the western meal weren't available so it was paired with a tofu and strange squid salad from the Korean menu. Breakfast was terrible and were two dried eggs with a pasty sauce.

Amenities - economy pillow and economy blanket - no duvet, no mattress topper. No bottle of water provided.  No Express pass given for business class passengers for Sydney arrival. 

Entertainment - terrible selection of movies, less than 10% of what Singapore Airlines offers. Very poor quality of resolution and size of screen.

The only good thing about the flights were the crew - very service oriented, friendly (if not somewhat robotic) efficient and caring.

Both flights were late with the explanation """"late connections"""" which really meant '""""late inbound aircraft"""". First flight was 1.5 hours late, second was 2 hours late - aircraft had late inbound from PVG.

In summary, Asiana has really got to pull up it's socks. Competing carriers like JAL, ANA and SQ in the region blow away Asiana. I flew Korean last year and found them to be much better but not as good as the aforementioned carriers. The people are the most important part and I was really impressed with the crews but they are working with hardware and catering that could easily be improved.

I was traveling through South Korea with my wife and we went to several locations via Asiana. I was very happy. The price was decent for a major carrier and I was able to use and get points from United since they are partners. The flight from Beijing to Seoul was on-time and we got a hot meal - even though it was only a 2hr flight. I flew from Seoul to Jeju island which is only a 1hr flight and I also got a hot meal. They don't have strict carry-on rules so I was able to get my backpack onboard. That is a huge bonus since most of the budget carriers require me to check it, pay extra, and wait for my bag to come out. And they also offered free in-flight entertainment on a personalized screen from Beijing to Seoul. I watched a recent release movie on the way to Seoul for free.

- The crews are like their eye is place on top of their head. Getting a cup of ice water they will give you that face like you are very troublesome. Not only just 1 crew giving me that feeling. Come on we are on a few hours flight... it is common that people will get thirsty. Throughout that few hours flight I only call for 1 drink so I seriously don't think that is very overboard.

The A380 is a nice roomy plane but Asiana made no effort to set aside a lounge like Emirates does on their A380. The NY to Seoul flight is long but they only offer two meals. One shortly after takeoff and a second one about an hour before landing.  That leaves a 10 hour gap where no food is served. We asked for a snack and got a bowl of ramen but I think they should have been more open about snack availability. The crew is polite but don't engage with passengers. I think partly because their English is limited. On a long flight it's nice to be able to stretch the legs and engage with crew and fellow passengers. The business class seats were comfortable but the entertainment offerings were weak. Most of the movies were bad and dated. And tehre was a limited selection. The Korean food was good.

Thumps up to Asiana Airlines.  I had doubts at first as my other first Airline choice was Korean Air, Asiana  Airline proofed me wrong.  The return flight was better no delays.

It's a joy to be back on an Asian airline, in this case Korean, with surprisingly good food both Asian and Western, good wines, and efficient service, a bit on the formal side compared to the casual attitude on all US airlines.

Asiana was picked because of the Clark International Airport destination. Flying to Manila and then trying to get out of Manila is pure insanity with the traffic. Clark International is a great alternative and we were very pleased that that connection existed in the Philippines. 
The seats on the aircraft are really comfortable and roomy. I abhore airline food but in this case I will make the exception because of the selection of Korean foods that was offered. I have to commend the airlines for the amenities it offers on the flight. Slippers, combs, toothbrushes in the restroom etc. I've been on very long flight and the rest room are what they are from beginning to the end of the flight. In the case of Asiana Airlines personnel kept the facility clean and stocked. My wife and I had no qualms about using the facility because of this fact.

I really recommend bringing a good quality neck pillow, but the headrests are pretty maneuverable which will support your head pretty well, but if you're a restless flyer like me, a neck pillow will do you wonders. Besides not really being able to sleep, everything else about the airline was pretty pleasant. There was plenty of free food to eat, pretty much a full course meal with both korean and american foods - you had an option. We were pretty surprised with the amount of food we were given during our flight. There was a main entree with a drink, and usually a few additional snacks or side dishes. There was a variety of movies and shows to watch, games to play and music to listen to. The lineups for the washroom were a bit long at times so if you frequently use the washroom, request an aisle seat and wait for the line to lull.

We were fed constantly and all drinks were free, the entire flight! We were given blankets, pillows and slippers and I believe head phones as well.

food on board is good, with a Korean and Western option and is better than I have seen in economy on other airlines.

Asiana has a kinda strict luggage rule, you can only carry one luggage of maximum 23 kg comparing to 30 kg and 2 luggages of Thai Air. The airplane from Incheon to Bangkok was maybe A380 something which has 2 floors, and it was not full so I got to sit 2 seats, really comfy. The entertainment does not offer much but still enough for my 5 hour flight. The food is bad in my opinion because I couldn't eat anything. They offered a bentou for flight from Fukuoka to Incheon and bimbibap (mixed rice) for Incheon to Bangkok. The great thing of Asiana is that, when I flew back from Bangkok, my flight was delayed so they automatically transfered me to Thai Air and they gave me the premium lane card so I didn't need to queue for passport control anything. The fact that they handled it so smooth made me feel relaxing. And I was worried about my luggage as I would fly 2 airlines but then they arrived normally."

The staff  ( flight  attendants ) were very helpful and polite and the overall service was very good. The meals served was also very good. You were given a choice of Korean or Western meal. I was extremely pleased by the service of I had on board Asiana airlines and would not mind flying this airline again. I would give it a 4 star out of 5 star service!"

The flight attendants were courteous and always offered refreshments. The food didn't disappoint me too. I opted to book for the upper deck economy seats on the flight to JFK. It was my first time to ride the A380 too. I find it more convenient to reserve seats on the upper deck for more room and storage on the side, plus boarding is easier, since there are fewer seats. Overall, I would fly Asiana for long haul flights especially when visiting the US."

Priority Handling on Baggage - 2 Star  They have different tiers even for priority baggage.  You can be the highest tier member but if you're on economy, don't expect your bags anytime soon.

Lounge - 5 Star (Their lounge is one of the best in the world)

At Gate - 3 Star (What's the point in having lines if it's not regulated.  They take premium cabin, elite members, and regular economy customers at the same time)  It's a nightmare.

In-Flight - 3 Star.  (This plane had a power plug and USB port in all rows.  But they didn't all work for everyone.)
 - In-Flight entertainment was very limited.
 - If you need wifi, look elsewhere.
 - Food quality has gone down.
 - Beverage refresh rate and selections has gone down.

Cabin Crew - 5 Star.  They are efficient, friendly, patient, and literally speak every there language.  So communications and getting help is not an issue.

Cabin Conditions - 3 Star.  It was hot then really cold and then hot again.  Seats were worn out.  Window shades were stuck.

Elite Status - 1 Star.  There really are no benefits for this program now.  No upgrades, and no real priority anything.  You just get a cool looking card and bag tags.  If you take Star Alliance, you may be better off exploring other airline's programs, as I am going to be cutting my losses here soon and exploring other programs as well.

You write one good review for them, they keep sending you surveys.  You give them one bad review, they don't send you anymore surveys at all.  They used to thank you and recognize your membership level.  They don't have that anymore either!

Considering their quality and services went down, they are more expensive than their competitors with less to offer.  If you can find a roundtrip ticket from the US to Asia with them for less than $1100 for economy, then go ahead and book it.  However, their average prices are usually $1500-$1800 for a roundtrip ticket, where United or Singapore are between $750-$1100 with much more amenities.  If you fly Asian from SFO, they are always the cheapest.  But like I said, if they are more than $1100, I'd fly with someone else.  Many of their competitors are cheaper and offer more."

How is it that their staff, regardless of where they are in the world, speaks NO Korean OR English?!?  Check-In was a nightmare.  

The cabin was dirty and crowded.  There were odors coming from the seating and carpeting.  The carpeting was coming off.  In a tough economy, they need to increase their level of services, not downgrade.  I thought the objective of companies was to retain their customers and get new ones.  Well they are losing out now...Asiana has gotten VERY cheap.  Apparently, as of this month, they don't even offer drinks like soda and juices (on an international flight!!!).  They only have water and tea now?  

They have no power or USB plugs...media screens don't work and no wifi.  (really shows how little they care about customer satisfaction and amenities.)

You can be the highest tier member (which I am) in their airline mileage program but you don't get much (no upgrades or priority services in the airport.)  You get your priority baggage and boarding...but they have many categories for that too...so if you are not on a premium cabin...those don't mean much either.

By the way, the plane was very loud and rocky.  During take off and landing...I swear to god I thought the plane was gonna fall apart or explode...they really need to upgrade their equipment and get their planes checked out.

In my opinion they are no longer a 5 star airline...they've been 2 star for many years now.

If it wasn't for the great flight attendant staff on-board, I would've given a 1 star.

Many of the other airlines are really stepping up the quality, unlike these guys who are going backwards.  Cabin quality looks really old.  In some seats there are stains and odor.  There is not enough leg space.  In this particular aircraft, there were no charging or USB ports.  Most of the in-flight entertainment (what entertainment?) screens were broken and not working.

On arrival, I was told the flight WAS departing on time when the boards said there was a 4 hour delay. There were no announcements so I went into the departures area to be told there was yet another delay. There was 'compensation' consisting of a small box with chicken in sauce and masses of sticky white rice with some chopped peppers. We eventually boarded almost 5 hours after expected departure time. There was no proper announcement so people just queued at a gate. On board, a very bored-sounding hostess apologised as if WE were at fault, and rattled through the safety aspects so quickly it was inaudible. Given the aircraft was delayed due to some maintenance issue, that might have been crucial. Food offerings were poor. There was some warbled message about not consuming items not purchased on the plane but what the hell they could do about it if you did beats me. Air Asia in Malaysia operates a good schedule and has far higher standards of service. Air Asia Indonesia is downright sloppy. Fly Garuda for higher standards or Lion for more frequent, though basic, offerings.

I was not allowed to board this flight because I missed my earlier flight from Incheon to Tianjin due to late arrival of the aircraft. I was told as a result of that, the remainder of my flights were cancelled including further flights beyond Incheon. This was never explained to me at Incheon when I missed my flight, if they had I would have asked my office to fix it.
Instead the gentleman who refused to assist me keep stating its not the fault of the airline my ticket was cancelled and told me rather rudely I could either buy another ticket with them or fly another airline. At this point another Korean gentlemen, a more senior staff came to my assistance and explained to me their procedure, apologise for their failure to point out to me their failings in Incheon, led me to their ticketing counter and assisted me in getting a new ticket issued to allow me to continue my journey.
Asiana Air is a service provider and staff needs to be properly trained to handle situations as nobody wants to be stucked in a airport through no fault of theirs and the airline try to washed their hands off it. 
My entire experience at the check in was very disappointing to the point I have to raise my voice many times and I'm glad a good senior ambassador of the airline came along, and it ended well. I would like to thank this elderly Korean gentleman for doing a good job"

We booked the flights through Aisana but United was the partner for the USA legs.  First, we were pleasantly surprised to learn that Asiana gives you two free checked bags each; and, that fact passes through to United.  We did not have to pay for the bags on the USA legs.  We had a 777 for the flight to Korea and a late model Airbus for the flight back.  Asiana's flights were well-staffed with many flight attendants.  I think that I counted upwards of 20 of them getting on the return flight, which was the larger Airbus.  The entertainment options were excellent, with many movies, music, and games available at each seat.  Each seat also had its own USB outlet so that you didn't run down your devices on the long flights.  Leg room in economy for my wife and I (we're short) was fine.  I found the seat cushion to be very hard on both flights and I was in significant discomfort from it.  You may want to bring a foam pad to be safe, if you tend to find seat firmness an issue.  Asiana kept us well fed, with a western and korean option on the full meals.  There were multiple snacks served and they came around with beverages repeatedly.  That said, I found the beverages a challenge.  They don't bring out a full beverage cart like U.S. airlines do.  The flight attendants came around with a tray of glasses of water, juice, and sometimes soda.  That said, the relatively small glasses were only half full so it really wasn't enough to drink.  You will want to ensure you bring bottled water with you.  They serve wine with the meals, again, small glasses, half full.  There was no opportunity to purchase a full serving of wine / liquor, or to get a full cup of coffee.  I have trouble sleeping on planes and would have liked a scotch or two to help me nod off.  Before the flight back, I specifically asked of the gate attendants if there was an option to buy a drink but couldn't make myself understood and all I got was a duty free catalog.  They do have beer available for free, but it is fairly warm.  They serve coffee and tea with the full meals but, once again, it is a very small cup only partially filled.  I don't mean to belabor the beverage service but since it is different than USA flights I want others to be forewarned.  All in all we found Asiana to be a very capable airline and I wouldn't hesitate to fly them again, but I would bring a seat cushion the next time!"

And as instructed by my doctor I got up every couple of hours to stretch and walk about. The seats were right at the back which meant a lot of jet noise. Thanks brother for lending me your noise cancelling headphones (indispensible!). The food was quite edible. (Choice between Korean and European - I chose Korean).

For this particular flight, it's a typical Asiana economy service. A very efficient and helpful check-in desk at the airport. It was a full flight, but the cabin crews direct and assist passengers boarding the aircraft. Cabin crews were friendly, courteous, and extremely helpful. IMHO impeccable.

Take off, landing and flight were smooth; kudos to the cockpit crews. I actually can hear what the pilot was saying when he was making announcements. Some other airline, no offense, but I have a problem understanding what was said.

Food, they have a choice of either Korean food or a more western food. I like the Korean version more than their Western food. I think it's tastier than the standard airline meal. I had the bibimbap, if you don't like spicy food, go easy on the chili paste. 

Entertainment, I like their balance selection of movies. Both Hollywood and Korean movies, from various genres. I think there is something for everyone.

I have flown this route several times and it is delayed 80% of the time by 20-60 minutes. Service is fine and leg room is good, so I was able to take a decent nap in the window seat. However, for what you pay this flight isn't worth it... Korean Air offers a much nicer experience while Vietnam Airlines offers similar service at a lower price."

The check-in was perfect, we arrived just 20 minutes before the counter closed. Our seats were chosen in advance and we had a very first row in economy. While purchasing our tickets we asked Asiana to provide a baby basinet, baby food and etc. Airline provided everything. Baby basinets are quite comfortable, so our baby really enjoyed sleeping during 60% of whole flight.

The aircraft was A321 which is good for 2-3 hours flights. More over, Asiana's A321 equipped with personal AVOD (audio/video on request) system that is not very common for a short-to-medium haul aircraft. This is a huge positive point. Food was also great (even hot meal was provided). 

The only minus is that Asiana is always having some delays from KHV (from 30 min. to 1 hour) which affects arrival time to ICN and makes your connection time less than expected. 

In general, Asiana is good airline for flying with infants. Seats, basinets, baby food - all were provided for free even in economy. Ticket price was also the best from all options.

The plane controls the total plane temperature. There are no individual air vents. My husband began turning red and needed direct air. He has had heat stroke before and we have to watch his body temperature. I explained this to the stewardess that they better drop the whole plane temperature, other people were uncomfortable too. She didn't bring us ice or cold towels to bring down his body temperature. I had to fan my husband.
It was hard to get the stewardess' help because they were busy for quite awhile bowing to some big wig in the first row. The bowing is part of the culture, but we needed help with a health heat issue. Due to the air vents situation, we can't fly Asiana again."

It started when my flight from Lansing, MI to Chicago was so late I missed my first flight (where I was confirmed 1st Class). Whenever I went up to the counter I was never recognized as a 1K flyer. I would think the gate people would want to know who their flyers are but it appears they could care less. I was confirmed at the last minute on a later flight. It was bad enough that I went from a confirmed first class seat to coach, but when I was put in a middle seat, it was a nightmare for me. I had no choice. What bothered me is that had they recognized me as a 1K when I first checked in at the gate, they would have been able to get me a better seat. They were just """"too busy."""" When they were selling food, they were going to charge me for the snack box when as a 1K it's supposed to be complimentary. It showed on the plane too that they simply did not care one iota about a flyers elite status. The flight attendants just did their job with no show of any joy whatsoever.

I'd ordered vegetarian meals which were AWFUL. When I asked for another meal, they said they had nothing else (at all) available. This is nonsense; I worked with the airlines (on the ground) in the past and I know they always have extra food. I was hungry almost the entire way to Cambodia (two very long flights via Seoul, South Korea). 

On arrival to the airport in Phnom Penh, I approached an Asiana rep & cancelled the vegetarian means for the return flights. On route back, however, we were delivered not only the veg. meals BUT THE EXACT SAME DISGUSTING SLOP we were served on the way. I tried to explain that we had cancelled these and asked her to bring us the regular menu but the flight attendant looked annoyed and as if she didn't understand me. I was hungry all the way back to JFK!

The plane is gargantuan and great to fly on. It is reminiscent of the Pan Am 747 transcon days. The only control at your seat in economy that is not available or I couldn't find it was the airflow control on the overhead console. There was one for the light but none for the airflow. Truthfully it really wasn't needed as the cabin was very comfortable.
Asiana was professional all around and I would fly it to Asia on every trip except the Aircraft do not have WI-fi on board and there is no information on when it will be installed?
So as much as I loved the flight going 12-14 hours in the digital age is unnecessary and unthinkable especially with everyone having an mobile devises. Other than that there is great service plenty of food and beverages. I was served two meals and snacks on all
legs (1 meal ICN-BKK and back). The flight attendants are polite and never rude or angry looking like their American rivals.

I learned the hard way unfortunately. Ive rated seat comfort low as the planes on this route have old business class seats that are not lay flat and dig into you a bit.

So the second time I decided to try a different airline and decided to try to fly the new Airbus A380 which Asiana had just put into service. I flew with them on the A380 in economy class in the upper deck and found the experience sooo much better than United. Nicer and bigger seat, better food, better entertainment system and the service from flight attendants was over the top. The next year I decided I'd try them again but in business class--their prices for business class were much less than all other airlines to Manila. They say once you fly business class you can never go back to economy class---I'm finding that to be so true!  I did fly the Boeing 777 in business class to Inchon and from there to Manila.  What a new and great experience for me! A lay flat bed, all kinds of room, a regular menu with choices of different foods and drinks and the flight attendant introduced herself to me as being the one serving and taking care of me during our 13 hour flight to Korea.  All the flight attendants on my flights on Asiana spoke very good English--no problems there.  The food was above average but nothing spectacular but I did have some good choices, and having regular silverware and flatware instead of plastic trays and forks was nice also.  Being able to lay down fully and sleep on the flight was such a blessing--no jet lag here!  The airport in Inchon is one of the best airports I've ever been too--easy to get through and navigate and clean and all signage is in Korean and English--and all shops and restaurants take US dollars but change will be given in Korean money.  I've already booked my next flight to Manila on Asiana for this coming year in business class again as the price was again very good and the flight I took before on the Boeing 777 has been replaced by the A380 so I'm looking forward to flying Asiana again!"

Perhaps it's because I was the only Caucasian on the flight (At least that I could see) I've never experienced such a situation before. I think it's more to do with poor service, cost cutting and/or laziness. The whole experience was extremely disappointing and I'll never fly this airline again.

The service and the food was fine, nothing exceptional though. The food was okay. They served bibimbap twice. They ran out of the chicken quickly. It was also an older aircraft so that amenities were not up-to-date though sufficient. The best thing about our flight was the skill of the pilot. Our plane was diverted to another airport in the Philippines due to bad weather in Manila. We refueled and after a little while headed for the Manila airport. We could not land so the pilot circled the air until we got the clearance to land. Though there was turbulence in the skies, the bumpy moments were few. When we finally landed, the plane smoothly touched the ground. It was a testament to the pilot's skills. Communication between the flight crew and passengers could be improved, especially during moments when unusual situations were happening.

Thankfully, the layover between flights was long enough that it didn't matter but it would have been nice to get to my destination sooner since I had someone waiting for me there.  But in particular, the longest leg, JFK-ICN, which was flown on an A-380, was not pleasant, mostly because the seats on that plane are the most uncomfortable I have ever experienced.  It was impossible to sit for more than an hour or two without being in agony, and this was a fourteen hour flight!  The leg from ICN to MNL was on a 777 and the seats were WAY more comfortable.  But the A-380...torture.  I mean, it's a great plane, very stable, goes through turbulence with hardly a bounce or jolt, but THOSE SEATS...the other annoying thing was that the entertainment system kept crashing.  Happened three times, each one leaving us staring at the seat back in front of us for 15 to 20 minutes.  But hey....the food was pretty good.  ;-)"

With 150 EUR per person, this was the most expensive flight on our east asia round trip. However, for several other so-called """"low cost"""" carriers, we still paid 100 bucks and were rewarded with an abysmal experience.

The website provided an online check in (in my native language! german), which was a bit cumbersome in usage, but got the job done. I did not find any option to download the boarding cards into iOS Wallet.

The 7-year-old A330 looked okay from the outside. The interior design was like a journey back in time, and reminded me of the 90s. Check out the photos and judge for yourself.
The interior was quite  """"spacy"""": There was plenty of legroom. The overhead lockers were a little smaller than usual. The seat configuration was only 2-3-2, which made the aisles quite wide.

The food was good, and included in the price of the flight. There was no in-seat Entertainment, only overhead monitors.

The crew was very nice, and capable of a slighly better-than-average-in-asia english. When the seatbelt signs were turned on during cruise flight, the performed a little choreography, walking through the cabin in a 2-2-group with the exact same step and all in the same voice constantly asking to fasten seatbelt, return to seat, put up tray table.

Asiana is also one of the few carriers that's still rather classy! My last trip to Vietnam on Asiana (March 2016) was no exception, it was wonderful. While no airline in the world is perfect, Asiana makes very few mistakes. My hint to the flying public is to purchase your Asiana ticket as early as possible, because there is a limited number of those inexpensive ones. 

I think I have flown on most of Asiana's fleet to date, and I have to say that my favorite plane is the OZ 744, while my least favorite would be the OZ 788. This is the airline with the friendliest flight attendants and the roomiest economy class."

It was a family trip with my mom, and we had never heard of this airline - so we really didn't know what to expect. We had flown Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific in Business Class, and so were accustomed to premiere service and planes.

Wow. We were treated like royalty. And the food was UNBELIEVABLE. Seven years and more than 30 flights later, I can say that this airline has consistently delivered top notch service and food on every single flight I have taken. The new Airbus 380 from Los Angeles to Seoul is especially fantastic.

My only complaint is that the food in the Incheon business lounge is completely subpar. And I use the term 'food' loosely as instant noodles and cheese sauce from a jar to accompany your Nacho chips - the staple of their business lounge - is not what I would expect from an airline of this calibre. Also, the massage chairs could use a refurbishment - the pleather covering is worn out and ripped on many of the chairs. Other than those two points - it is a nice lounge with excellent internet access and lots of comfy seating.

As I have a Priority Pass, I just go to that lounge for the food - and return to the Asiana Lounge for the ambiance. But I would love to see a better food selection in the lounge to match on-board food - which is amazing."

The Business class was very nice and comfortable; especially service attitudes of the flight attendants were above the other carriers. However, I want to make a comment about the lounges in ICN (the stop over in Korea). The business lounge was crowded and noisy to say the least. The seats were not so comfortable, and the food was mediocre. only good thing that I can say is FAST INTERNET! The first class lounge was also mediocre in that the food was not much better and seats were not much different from the regular business lounge. Other than fast internet, only other thing I can recommend is their disposable shaver - which was very nice."

I did not sleep a wink on the flight to ICN, as I was in an aisle seat and I'm a light sleeper (bad combination).  Since I flew Asiana there and back, I'll summarize pros and cons:
Pros:
-Economy seats are decent size (I'm 5'11'' with long legs)
-Frequent meals, drinks, and snacks
-Friendly, attentive, AND attractive flight attendants
-In-flight entertainment saved the trip, as I watched movies back-to-back-to-back
Cons:
-Perpetually long line to use the restroom (LAX to ICN routes)
-Frequent interruptions/announcements in Korean started to wear on my nerves, as I ATTEMPTED to sleep
-Seats do not recline much and - when they do recline - it ends up encroaching in your space
-Food was NOT as good as some reviewers indicated. I've eaten REAL Korean food and REAL Japanese food.  The in-flight meal bordered on edible and decent.

This was the most enjoyable flight I've ever had.  It was my first time traveling to Asia, the flight was more than 12 hours, and I wanted to make sure I was comfortable.  Their business smartium seats made a world of difference.  Being able to lie down on such a long flight made traveling this distance a piece of cake.  The movie choices were surprisingly good and I got to see movies that were on my bucket list. 

The flight attendants were impeccable in their manners.  The food actually tasted great!  That's a first for me.  The LAX and Seoul business class lounges are well appointed and offer decent food and coffee.  They also provide rooms for showering.

Luckily the AA in flight service and quality was as good as the KAL. Food was decent and flight attendants were courteous and professional.

I have flown other airlines to the Asian sector, and would say Singapore airlines and Cathay are a step above.. i chose this airline mostly on price as they were hundreds $$ less for similar time flying."
10.1874551773071,9.65459156036377,"Asiana Flight Review",3,"For a 2 hour flight from Seoul, Korea to Narita, Japan I did not expect too many frills, but to not even have any form of seat entertainment (even in Business Class) was rather surprising.  The plane was an Airbus A320.  Bring a book or headphones to listen to your iPad/iPhone or other source of entertainment.  Overall, Asiana was acceptable and I would fly them again."
12.7028751373291,8.4795970916748,"Asiana Flight Review",5,"This is my first International flight to Hong Kong.  The service on this airline is exceptional throughout the entire flight.  The food was delicious and they offered free in-flight entertainment with unlimited movies.  I was also thrilled to ride on the A380 - this plane is HUGE and it was a thrill to be able to fly in this double-decker plane.  I have never heard of Asiana before, but I would not hesitate to fly them again."
9.68327140808105,8.98249053955078,"Asiana Flight Review",5,"Going there was a lot of room, nearly everyone had a row of 3 seats for themselves.  The food was amazing and simply the best Ive ever had on an airline.  Also, dozens of current movies available on demand...a great flight.

Coming back there were only 2 empty seats...movie selection still great...but had no choice for either meal...and those two meals sucked!  Fruit was old, salads wilted...and beef porage?  Really?  Each time was told, sorry sir we are out of everything except """"xyz""""..is that OK?   NO!

Staff were always friendly.

Only other complaint is why does the pilot even try to speak in English?  Heard the pilot or co pilot probably 1/2 dozen times each flight...never understood even one word.

12 hr lay over in Korea on return flight always ask for the free tour or hotel and food...Asiana does a great job providing this."
5.35642766952515,6.03801727294922,"Flight Attendant Service",4,"Seats were comfy and good amount of leg room as we are both tall. Two seats together so good not to be stuck in the middle of a three seat figuration. Food was ok, but I don't have expectations these days when flying to have a decent feed anyway. Entertainment. Eg movies etc was nothing new or exciting. Service good."
12.0744247436523,8.39887046813965,"Asiana Flight Review",5,"Asiana is just the best airline that I've flown. I traveled with my family from Bangkok to New York City with connecting OZ222 at Inchoen International Airport. When we arrived ICN we went to the lounge which provided us a very warmed welcome after a whole night out of our home. The WiFi in the lounge was very fast, nice bathroom to shower, various kind of drinks, food is average since we didn't have much appetite. When it came to the boarding time, we queued in a separate line as we flew business class. The Asiana staffs were very careful on checking U.S. Visa for all passengers, especially passengers who connected the flight. Even our family member is American and showed them U.S. Passport , they still ask him for his U.S. Visa.(unexpected, but it's fine hahaha) They boarded us following the class of service, unfortunately we noticed that there were other passengers from different class came in at the same time which block our stair case since our seats are on upper deck. The seats on business class of Asian A380 are total flatbed with safety belt like belt in the car. I love it. The minus point is the cabinet for window seat is very difficult to open. The inflight entertainment was great. There were many movies, songs, TV series and even the information of the destination available. Blankets were provided. The best that I have to mention was the food. Passengers could choose either western, asian or Korean menu as they like. There was also alternative choices to choose such as ramen, I tried it and found out that it taste wonderful with a big portion. The flight attendants were very cautious. They came by quite often just to see whether anyone needs assistant. In the front of upper deck stands the private lounge for both first class and business class passengers to relax and it has separate lavatory available. Flight attendants keep lavatory clean. The toiletry in lavatory was great, many items are available such as toothbrush set,comb, hand gel, moisturiser and eu de toilet. I love it. We were welcome with Champaign and hot towel. Once flight attendants served meal, they served them in a proper way  like in the restaurant. This is a perfect way to dine. When we arrived at JFK, our suitcases came out very quick. I certainly would like to recommend Asiana Airline to everyone."
10.3291501998901,8.2445821762085,"Flight Attendant Service",5,"This was a great flight, although long.  Fly Business class and definitely recommend
 on such a long flight. The service was great.  I won't use an American carrier again unless I have to.  International carriers are so much better, and I am a multi-million mile flyer on an American carrier."
4.97804498672485,6.26497459411621,"Flight Attendant Service",4,"Attentive staff, comfortable seat and bed. We sat in the middle row with 2 adjoining seats that face slightly inward. For single travelers most of the middle row seat face slightly outward for more privacy. The plane cabin was noticeably quieter than others I have flown which was a large plus for an 11 hr flight. The food was better than expected - great Norwegian gravlax appetizer. It was my first time flying Asiana - nice experience."
10.9674940109253,7.63974332809448,"Asiana Flight Review",4,"I travelled on Asiana Airlines with some friends in September 2015 on our holiday to Japan. They operate a great service, all four flights we used (Heathrow to Incheon, Incheon to Tokyo, Osaka to Incheon, Incheon to Heathrow) were on time, really nice food on them all, the entertainment system was good on them all but the first leg of our trip. The only problem I had was all the flights were so hot, we were sweating so much!

The staff on board were great too. Nothing was too much trouble, even when the lights were off at night. 

Good value too, we paid around £600 for all our flights."
10.2301120758057,10.5705604553223,"Asiana Flight Review",5,"The service on this airline is extremely good! I was constantly offered water and juice - I loved the food, and the entertainment was good, if a little old. For the price i paid, i got a stopover in Seoul included. I would fly Asiana over Etihad any day - just for the service in the cabin."
8.56116390228271,8.22775363922119,"Airline Seating Review",2,"Imagine this - you are sitting in business class for the first time in your life having spent thousands of dollars on a ticket expecting top class service. The menu displays two types of meals, Korean or Western.  I decide on the Western. After take-off and once service begins a cabin crew apologizes that with regard to the Western menu - they have no appetizers on board.  Ok - the aircraft has just taken off and you don't have a complete menu as in the brochure. I can accept that. When it comes to the end of the meal I spy on the serving tray either fresh fruit or a cheese plate as the choices available.  I'm served last and see one cheese plate remaining. Good!  I'll have that. I ask for the cheese plate and the lady says """"It's not free"""".  I think she meant """"it's not available""""  Oh okay!  Did I want the fresh fruit?  No thanks, I'll go without. Would have liked that last cheese plate on your tray but if I can't have it I won't argue.  Ten minutes later she returns with the cheese plate and says """"The captain doesn't want it!!!!""""   What ?  I was shocked that paid employees of the airline, no matter what their rank, are treated with more deference than the people who pay their salaries.  And this is business class.  Obviously customer service is not highly regarded with this airline.   I could go on further about their lousy business class lounge at Incheon airport where the best of the cuisine is hot 2 minute noodles - but I want.   The only advantage of this business class ticket which took me through to Istanbul and returned from Frankfurt is that you get to check in a bit quicker.  Immigration lines still what they are for economy class.  And as for the seat well I can't really criticise the airline for that.  I can't sleep in my own bed at home so how could I possibly sleep better laying and a flat bed on an aircraft?  Business class NOT worth it.  Just an exclusive perk for travelling executives."

I boarded; my seat in Economy was HUGE and totally reclined and for a 12+ hour trip this was heaven.I was brought slippers,blanket and a pillow. Then wonderful Japanese food and sake~everything was gratis.I could watch anything I wanted on the programming and could start and stop it at my convenience.I can not recommend this airline enough."

Asiana provides very good service, staff well trained and polite, as in most of the asian airlines. One of the best features of this plane is the level of noise, extremely lower than in all other big aircrafts. The new Business Smartium Class layout is very comfortable, as all seats have direct access to the aisle. Excellent flight experience in one of the best companies."

I felt like I had a little more leg room on Asiana than on Cathay Pacific, which is my preferred airline to fly to Asia. Entertainment package and TV screen were great for economy class. An outlet to charge laptops on all seats was a surprising touch. Would definitely consider to fly with them again.

I flew from JFK to HKG via ICN on a very modern Airbus A380 on the first leg and Boeing 777-200 on the second leg. Definitely like A380 more and more, I flew them with the Emirates, too;)"

My family and I have traveled the US and globe on multiple different carriers.  Asiana takes the cake at being the worst for the following issue:  

They lost my luggage on my way to SE Asian country.  The luggage ended up in China.....and was there for 3 weeks.  Mind you I was back in the US after 12 days, so another 9 days my luggage stayed lost.  The customer service reps did not want to compensate me for my lost luggage or cover my extra laundry bills because I had only one small duffel bag of clothes that was continually washed in order to keep clothes on my back.  Their customer service was entirely lackluster and lost themselves in what to do about the issue.  The LAX manager used emotional bullying tactics in an attempt not to cover my laundry bills and share """"how much he cared"""".  I don't buy anything their customer service or this airlines says and will be sharing this horror story with as many of my friend, business contacts and colleagues as possible. I am still in process of them sending me my reimbursement and this event started over 6 weeks ago.  Totally unsatisfactory."

I would defiantly fly with Asiana again, made the long journey enjoyable."
