Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the customer service I received regarding my flight (OSVJJN). 

In February, I received an email from Ryanair informing me that my flight had been canceled and that I needed to reschedule. I then changed my flight from 31st January to 10th February. Later, I was notified that the initial email was sent in error.

Despite explaining the situation to your representative, Patrycja, I received no assistance. I requested that my original booking in February be honored, but Patrycja insisted that I pay a €60 change fee. I clearly stated that I would not pay for this, as the mistake was not mine but Ryanair's. Unfortunately, Patrycja's behavior was unprofessional; instead of offering a solution, she ended the conversation abruptly, refusing to assist further. 

As a passenger, I felt disrespected and unsupported. I strongly believe that Patrycja's conduct does not reflect the standard of service that Ryanair should provide. I would like to formally lodge a complaint about her handling of this matter. Given this experience, I would not recommend her to represent Ryanair in customer service.

I look forward to your prompt attention to this matter.

Kind regards,

If you’re looking for an unforgettable travel experience for all the wrong reasons, look no further than this excuse for an airline. From start to finish, it’s a masterclass in how not to operate a business.

Booking Process

The chaos begins before you even board. Their website seems to have been designed in the 1990s by someone who hates both functionality and aesthetics. Expect constant crashes, hidden fees, and a confirmation email that  only provided a printable not digital boarding pass top tip don’t forget to print your boarding pass, Paper copies only!!! Or you’ll pay and exorbitant amount to print at the airport💰 

Check-In

Arriving at the airport, you’re greeted by a check-in line that stretches to the next terminal, overseen by a single staff member who looks like they’ve been held hostage. The airline has perfected the art of turning every step into an obstacle course of inconvenience.

The Flight

Prepare yourself for the worst. Delays are guaranteed, though the staff will remain blissfully vague about the reasons. Boarding is a free-for-all, and you’ll likely end up seated next to the lavatory, whether you paid extra or not. The cabin itself is a dystopian nightmare of broken seats, mystery stains, and air vents that refuse to vent.

The food? A culinary war crime. Imagine a soggy sandwich that expired during the previous century the only thing gourmet about it is the price.

And let’s not forget the entertainment system— there isn’t any.

Customer Service

There isn’t any of that either. Their motto seems to be, “Your problem, not ours.” Lost luggage? You’ll need a search party and possibly divine intervention to see it again. Complaints? Prepare for emails that go unanswered or responses so condescending they could double as insults.

Conclusion

Flying with this airline is less a mode of transportation and more a test of human endurance. If you want to arrive at your destination late, stressed, and questioning every life choice that brought you to this moment, then Ryanair is the airline for you.

Rating: 0/10. Would rather swim."

No response from the point of contact in the contract for problems. The 1.5 hour journey then took just over 4 hours because the driver refused to use the toll roads, presumably because of the cost. An attempt to change the return leg journey time resulted in being told it could only be changed if the return leg was cancelled. Once cancelled there was no way any form of refund was going to be provided just a new booking at a full price. Last ever flight on Ryanair, glad to see the back of them."

This experience served as a reminder that not all budget options offer value, and sometimes, you truly get what you pay for—only worse.

Seating: Cramped and Uncomfortable The seating arrangement on Ryanair could only be described as a sardine's nightmare. The legroom—or the lack thereof—was excruciating, with seats so tightly packed that even the slightest recline from the person in front felt like an invasion of personal space. The quality of the seats matched their comfort level: hard, unyielding, and seemingly designed with the sole purpose of turning a short flight into a marathon endurance test.

Overpriced Food: A Culinary Highway Robbery The food and beverage service was nothing short of daylight robbery. Overpriced does not even begin to cover the exorbitant rates charged for snacks and drinks that barely hit the mark of mediocrity. A simple bottle of water was priced as though it were sourced directly from an alpine spring, accompanied by a gourmet biscuit, which in reality, tasted like bland cardboard.

Service: Negligence and Nastiness The flight attendants seemed to have taken a lesson or two in the art of negligence, topped with a sprinkle of rudeness. One attendant, in particular, managed to combine an odorous presence with an attitude that suggested she had not only skipped her last shower but had also abandoned the concept of customer service years ago. Requests were met with sighs, eye rolls, and a tone that suggested that passengers were an inconvenient disturbance rather than valued customers.

A True Lack of Hygiene Among Flight Attendants A pervasive issue that notably exacerbated the overall discomfort of my Ryanair experience was the distressing lack of personal hygiene among the cabin crew. The entire flight attendant team seemed to have forsaken the basic norms of cleanliness. Their uniform appearance was disheveled, marked by stains and wrinkles that suggested a careless disregard for professionalism. The offensive body odor emanating from the crew filled the cabin, creating an almost tangible cloud of neglect that lingered throughout the flight. This disregard for personal grooming and cleanliness not only detracted from the overall experience but also raised concerns about the hygiene standards upheld by the airline itself, making an already unpleasant journey all the more intolerable.

Delay Disaster: A Day Lost To top off the series of unfortunate events, our flight was delayed by an entire day. The lack of communication from Ryanair was appalling. Updates were as sparse and unhelpful as their legroom, leaving passengers stranded and frustrated, scrambling to rearrange accommodations and connections. The airline's handling of the situation—or rather, the lack of handling—was a perfect endnote to their symphony of service failures.

Conclusion: Avoid at All Costs In summary, this Ryanair experience was a dismal failure across all fronts. From the uncomfortably cramped seats to the overpriced food, topped off with poor service and severe delays, it was a flight to remember for all the wrong reasons. For those considering Ryanair for a budget trip, consider this a cautionary tale: sometimes it's worth paying a little extra to avoid a lot of misery. If there's an airline that makes every penny spent elsewhere seem like a wise investment, it's Ryanair."
7.61218929290771,2.52895736694336,"Ryanair Baggage Complaints",2,"This is the second time I've been burnt by this airline. Back in 2018 my family and I traveled to Germany and they lost 2 of our suitcases. It took 4 of the 6 days we were there for them to be tracked down and we had to drive over an hour back to the airport to retrieve them. The entire process was such a headache and I was very dissatisfied so vowed not to travel with them again.

Fast forward 6 years. I had a family emergency and had to fly home quickly. Ryanair was the only airline available to get me from Malta to Dublin in time to make a Dublin to Boston flight. I had a carry on bag and back pack with me. I had flown on 4 other flights over the previous 2 weeks with no issues with these bags. 
While in line to board they would not let me proceed as they said my bag was too big. They insisted I pay a €75 fee to gate check the bag and could retrieve my bag on the carousel in Dublin. I tried to explain I did not have enough time to fetch my bag and make it to the connecting flight...in the other terminal. They did not care. At one point the attendant yelled at me and said if I didn't like their policies I could leave my bag in Malta. So rude!!

I asked for a supervisor. She was equally as rude. I tried to explain that I was needing to make this flight in Dublin so I could make it back to Boston as my mom would be having major surgery the next morning. Again, they did not seem to care. Only option she came up with was to pay the fee (which is exorbitant and ridiculous!) and they would tag my bag and I could ask the flight attendant if it could be stored in overhead. 

Out of desperation I paid the fee and boarded the flight. Attendant watched me put the bag in overhead with no issue, it fit fine with plenty of room to spare. Even the attendant agreed their policies are ridiculous and a ploy to get extra money. 

On top of all that you have to pay for items on the flight and the seats are stiff as boards and do not recline.

I want to share my extremely disappointing experience with Ryanair and warn anyone considering flying with them. This has been one of the most frustrating and stressful travel experiences of my life, and I feel it is essential for others to know what I’ve gone through.

First, I booked the Family Plus package with Ryanair, which clearly states that it includes baggage allowances, including four 10kg check-in bags and one 20kg check-in bag. Everything seemed in order when we purchased the package, but things took a sharp turn for the worse when we arrived at Stansted Airport.

Ryanair’s ground staff gave us misleading and conflicting information about checking in our smaller bags. Despite repeatedly asking if we could check in our smaller 10kg bags (which should have been included in our Family Plus package), three separate staff members told us we could not check them in, causing us to carry these heavy bags all the way to the boarding gate.

When we reached the gate, we were told we hadn’t checked in the bags properly, and we were hit with a £240 charge for what was essentially a mistake made by Ryanair staff. We explained the situation, stating that we had followed the guidance given by the ground staff, but were told it was too late to resolve it.

After the ordeal, we reached out to Ryanair’s customer service, hoping they would take responsibility for the issue and refund the unjust charge. However, their response was nothing short of appalling. They refused to acknowledge their staff's mistakes and simply stated that Ryanair flights are non-refundable. They recommended we contact our travel insurer—completely irrelevant to the situation. This is not just unhelpful, it’s a refusal to engage with a valid complaint.

It’s absolutely shocking that a company of Ryanair's size operates this way, misleading customers with incorrect information and then refusing to take accountability for their actions. They overcharged us, misinformed us, and now they’ve shown no willingness to resolve the issue.

This kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, and I’m now forced to take further action. If Ryanair is unwilling to refund the £240 they unjustly charged me, I will escalate this matter legally and take it to every consumer platform available. I will not allow this to happen to others, and I will make sure people are aware of the way Ryanair treats its customers.

I am sharing this review across all platforms, and I urge anyone considering flying with Ryanair to be extremely cautious. This company’s customer service is appalling, and their business practices are designed to take advantage of travelers. Don’t let yourself be misled and overcharged by Ryanair—choose an airline that values its customers and takes responsibility for their mistakes.

Ryanair, you’ve lost my business for good, and I will make sure others are aware of your appalling service.

The flight was fully booked and they didn’t let us put our luggage in the overhead compartments due to the lack of space. The planes are small and dirty.

Got no confirmation email about parking, so rang them and they said it is definitely booked and confirmed the details. When we got to Stansted Airport, Ryanair had not passed on the booking details, so we had to take a ticket for parking, and unless we could get confirmation from Ryanair prior to our return, we would have to pay the full cost. 

Check in was a nightmare because their system was down. There was barely any staff and the ones that were there weren’t helpful at all. 

We tried to speak to Ryanair customer services in the Airport, all of which were rude and unhelpful. The Ryanair staff there even said themselves never book parking through Ryanair. 

Once we arrived in Budapest, we rang Ryanair and whilst explaining our situation the first person hung up on us. We rang again, the second person could not send us an email, would not let us speak to a manager and tried everything possible to get us off the phone. 

He then assured us that if we sent a screenshot of an email from Stansted Airport requesting parking confirmation from Ryanair, to the Ryanair online chat, we would then get the requested confirmation email. We did not. Instead the person on the online chat left, and did not deal with our issue.

They charge me for extra baggage for my purse! For my bloody purse! It can barely fit 2 mobile phones inside it. How ridiculous!!! 

They charge my friend for extra luggage because the HANDLE was sticking above the line by a centimetre.

There was no shuttle service, as per their instructions, and 20+ calls to Payless went unanswered.
My family, including children, was left stranded with luggage and forced to arrange accommodation and transportation at our own expense.
Despite this, Ryanair failed to take any responsibility as the intermediary for connecting me with such an unreliable partner. Their customer service has been dismissive, offering only a refund for one rental day—ignoring the significant disruption caused.

Ryanair should vet their partners more carefully and take responsibility when customers face such failures. This experience has severely damaged my trust in Ryanair’s services."

I told her it has the exact measurements as listed online and she assured me she can meassure with her eyes and knows this is bigger, even though it also fitted into their “size tester”. We saw other priority customers which had wider (hardcover) suits and she didn’t tested those. Just to mentioned my bag was half full and literally squeezable to make it even smaller. She again said I should have just waited in the correct line and confirmed there is nothing to complain about. Her colleague was laughing at me and said to just leave my bag here if I don’t want to pay, and after saying if they think it would be funny to send a pregnant woman without clothes into a cold country, all I received was laughter and I should “relax”.

I understand and accept you get what you pay for but Issues were
1). Not keeping customers aware of any delay issues. 
2). Total chaos with staff providing support to disabled passengers because staff at the departure gate especially the lady was unfriendly, unprofessional, kept her back to customers at all times, ignored people with disabilities who needed their partners to assist them slide onto their seat. She wanted me to pay for priority seating. She refused me to board with my disabled partner. We both got upset about that. Ryanair need to clarify their policies and also offer additional training and support to their staff who seem unaware of people with disabilities needs such as accessing toilets, accessing their medication. Being treated in a reasonable and fair manner. Just being treated equally. 
3). Staff took my partner onto the plane without me. My partner explained I was needed to help get him onto his seat without pain but the lady ignored repeated calls for help. Unacceptable service. 
On the plane everything was good. Staff were very helpful. 
Coming back the special assistance staff were fantastic. It’s concerning that I had to make these comments. We think we have moved on with disabled rights but clearly we still have a way to go. 

Final comment boarding passengers
Prirority passengers first as they have paid for the service. Then maybe but up to airline to decide disabled passengers next or leave them to last as their seats are confirmed then say rows 10 to 15 then rows 16 to 20. I think passengers would find it less stressful, staff would find it a faster way to get bum on seats, less fuel used as passengers are seated quickly so more profit for Ryanair.

My daughter ended up spending £350 ish as they was without everything for a whole four days.

When we requested more information on whether we could leave the airport and then return, compensation queries etc the Ryanair staff seemed very clueless and were unsure of protocols.
We received a message informing us that we had 8 euro meal vouchers to spend as compensation but the only cafe in the airport was the Ahkio kitchen and bar and most items were double-triple the value of the voucher. 
Even at the newly proposed delayed departure time, there were further delays and chaos at the gate- it was very unorganised. They were only refuelling the aircraft after the boarding time despite the aircraft being there since 8 hours earlier.
There was poor service on the flight, unhelpful and unfriendly staff, uncomfortable seats, not clean and there were some weird communications made from the cockpit at one point.
The worst thing was that there was lack of communication and information throughout this stressful period, and the app even said that we arrived with no delay when we were still in the airport of origin; this made claiming compensation very difficult."

Want to hear my tale of woe?

I flew from London to West Ireland with this suitcase as a carry-on without issue. On my return, myself and several other passengers were pulled aside at the gate because staff thought our bags were oversized. To my surprise, I discovered that my bag which had been within carry-on dimensions on other airlines was about an inch too deep for Ryanair's smaller allowance. Despite knowing that it had fit comfortably in their overhead bin on the flight over, I said """"okay, that's my bad"""" and coughed up the €75 gate checking fee. 

Turns out I politely paid for the service of having my possessions chomped on by some dragon they keep in the back at Stansted Airport!

After my suitcase, may it rest in peace, failed to appear at baggage claim, I filed a charmingly titled """"Property Irregularity Report"""" and went away with the clothes on my back to wait for the airport to locate my bag. The agent who contacted me two days later said, """"it was completely torn apart."""" They wouldn't be able to deliver the contents to me for another four days, which wouldn't work because I live in overseas and was returning home in three days time. 

So I went to collect the suitcase at my own expense, a fun trip that took four hours roundtrip from where I was staying.

Stansted staff were courteous and I take no issue with them individually. However, they seemed embarrassed and unprepared to follow up with me. They wheeled out my belongings inside a cheap used replacement suitcase and I had to ask to see the original, which elicited exclamations of horror from other passengers standing around the desk when it emerged. I asked if I could review the contents somewhere more private, and they sheepishly offered me the floor in a corner of baggage claim. A curious janitor wandered by and asked me what airline had provided this incredible service to me. 

My belongings were returned to me in a jumbled pile, with some objects broken and everything coated in black dust. The soles of my pair of crushed trainers had been ground down as if held over a carpenter's grinder. This leads me to think that the suitcase probably became caught in a luggage cart and dragged over the tarmac, or something. But I’ll probably never know, and what was truly bizarre to me is that the agent who helped me repeatedly asserted that “it was caught in an engine.”

“Caught in WHAT?” I replied. Wouldn’t that be catastrophically dangerous? She stammered that she didn’t think it was dangerous because the plane was “probably on the ground at the time.”

Moving on from that troubling notion, I filled out the correct paperwork and filed a claim online within their deadline. This turns out to be one of Ryanair’s cleverest predatory policies, since, compared to a public baggage claim desk, no one online can hear you scream. 

I asked to be reimbursed for the cost of the suitcase and followed their confusing and often contradictory directions to report the cost of the suitcase and any “damaged or dirty” contents. However, I am a normal human being and had not retained paper receipts for the suitcase I bought several months earlier, nor my meager peasant (I mean, economy traveler) possessions. No one at the airport had indicated to me that I would have trouble with reimbursement because of receipts, or offered me a nominal fee, which I read about later on forums. So I included a screenshot of my credit card statement for the purchase of the bag instead, and this has tied up my claim to the present day, 15 business days after filing. 

TL;DR, I’m sure that the cost of checking, collecting, and replacing my suitcase is more than double the amount I thought I could save by flying Ryanair.

On November 16th, I booked a flight for my wife from Stansted to Krakow, alongside an OPEN return coach ticket with National Express. I’ve booked similar trips countless times without issue—until Ryanair decided to ruin everything.

Ryanair sent National Express the wrong details for the return journey, booking it for the same day instead of an OPEN ticket as per my reservation. National Express confirmed this was Ryanair's fault, and I received the same confirmation from Ryanair when I contacted them. Yet, Ryanair washed their hands of the issue, telling me to contact National Express, who, unsurprisingly, refused to help. According to them, Ryanair made the error, and they weren’t responsible for third-party mistakes.

I now have to fork out additional money to purchase a new return ticket for my wife, because Ryanair, despite being at fault, refuses to do anything about it. Their refund system is a joke—there’s no way to even request a refund for this kind of error. When I demanded a resolution, I was met with the same worthless advice to """"contact the carrier directly,"""" even though National Express has already made it clear they can’t assist.

Ryanair’s utter incompetence and lack of accountability are astounding. Not only did they ruin our travel plans, but their customer service is a disgrace. I will be pursuing a refund through any means necessary, but as for trusting Ryanair with any future bookings—absolutely not. I would rather pay extra for any other airline or coach service that actually knows how to do business.

I know United Airlines gives a 4 hour window if you kiss your flight for any reason, and will rebook you on the next available flight.

The cancellation email promised assistance with rerouting. As Ryanair cancelled all flights from the city through the next month, I was advised by customer assistance to book another flight and then file a claim for expenses reimbursement under EU 261. Ticket prices had risen over 3 times due to low supply, so I purchased the cheapest comparable ticket and I submitted the claim. 

The EU 261 specialist who later contacted me refused a refund and stated that Jordanian airspace was restricted at the time of the cancelled flight. This justification was a lie. Jordanian airspace was open at the scheduled time of the flight and open on the day it was cancelled. I escalated the claim and around a month later, Ryanair has yet to issue the reimbursement or counter-offer a refund. 

I think it is pathetic that if Ryanair cancels flights when they are deemed to be financially risky, they refuse to reimburse expenses (despite advertising that they must under EU law) and hope to pocket the original ticket fare.

Unfortunately, this time we faced a series of events that, we believe, were caused by unprofessional behavior from one of Ryanair staff members, which had a significant impact on our trip. At the boarding gate, we were asked to check our carry-on bags in the baggage sizer. Our first bag fit without any issues, but as we began to check the second bag, a staff member, whose name we later learned to be Maggie(name has been change due to privacy), unexpectedly requested a recheck. Although the second bag also complied with your regulations, she insisted on her own assessment and refused to listen to us. When we asked for an explanation and her name, she declined to respond, walked away, and ignored our requests to call a manager. A manager, Julie(name has been changed)later arrived (we are unsure whether Maggie called her or she came on her own initiative) and helped resolve the issue. We are grateful to Julie for her professionalism and assistance, which allowed us to board without further delay. However, Maggie did not scan our boarding passes, which, as we understand, meant that we were not recorded in the system as being onboard. This failure not only caused issues with our baggage but also raises serious safety concerns. Without our boarding passes scanned, the system could not correctly account for the number of passengers on board, potentially violating safety regulations and risking confusion in an emergency. Unfortunately, the consequences did not end there. Upon arrival, we discovered that our baggage, containing a paddleboard and other essential items, such as toiletries, was not with us. We were informed that the bag would arrive the next day; however, it was only delivered on Tuesday — four days later — which significantly affected our plans. Without our baggage, we had to delay scheduled activities, severely limiting our time on the island, given that our trip was only nine days. The absence of our paddleboard and toiletries also caused considerable inconvenience and affected our overall experience. When we finally received our baggage, we found that the bag was damaged — the zipper was torn, and the protective wrap for the paddleboard was also ripped and damaged. We are attaching photos of the damages taken immediately at the airport, and we are ready to provide a short video demonstrating the staff member’s refusal to communicate with us.
The issue which we have now is that we are trying to get in touch with the Ryanair however they refusing to help us as we did not report officially that our language  is damaged .

They could easily sell my seat to someone else; I booked the flight a month before the departure date. Most airlines that are even semi-decent have a 24-hour cancellation policy.

Terrible Experience with Ryanair – Hidden Fees and Zero Flexibility

I recently had a terrible experience with Ryanair. I booked a flight and paid to check my luggage, but when I arrived, I was unexpectedly charged 50 euros more to bring my bag on board! Despite having already paid for checked baggage, I had no choice but to pay again, or I wouldn’t be allowed to board. To make matters worse, I was delayed because I got out of call of the hospital shift at 8 pm. My flight was scheduled to depart at 9:20 pm, and Ryanair’s lack of flexibility made it impossible for me to get to the gate on time.

The customer service was completely unhelpful and unsympathetic to my situation, even though I explained my circumstances.

We were served by staff Azevedi (28AVR25). Earlier, my hand luggage had fitted into the luggage size checker that was beside their check-in desk but did not fit into the one by their boarding gate!  Staff 28AVR25, with a smirk, asked me to pay the baggage difference. I was confused, but complied. I explained that my hand luggage previously did fit and was confused, however 28AVR25 just smirked again, ignored what I had said and smuggly fabricated that I had 'refused' to measure my hand luggage at the check in counter. When I showed her I had used the size checker she stated it was the wrong one. When I told her she should have clarified that at the check-in desk she said it wasn't her job to. This provoked me and she asked me to say whatever I was saying 'with chest', which I found to be baffling, unprofessional language from a Ryanair staff. I proceeded to the aircraft but was stopped for one last check by Alves (16AG025) who claimed to be the manager and soon became confrontational. At the same time, 28AVR25 randomly accused me of taking a picture of his ID, another untruth. 16AG025 shockingly told me that """"something is wrong with me."""" His abrasive behaviour as a so-called manager was off-beat and foul. I don't believe I've ever witnessed such a strange and inappropriate display of service. So complained to their customer service centre. Their case handling was just as bad, missing the point entirely by robotically and repeatedly reciting their baggage policy rather than focusing on the issue I raised regarding foul treatment by staff. In conclusion, there is no hope for the airline, and it is better to avoid if you can."

But then the dragon decided to turn its smoking nostrils in my direction this week. There I was, with my wife and 22-month-old daughter at the gate on my return flight back home from Amsterdam. I had no trouble on the way in. We checked in our bags in Dublin, and they didn’t spot a thing. We got through at the gate in Dublin, no problem. Nor did they see anything wrong when we checked in our bags on our way back in Amsterdam. But then we arrived at the gate…

Apparently there was something wrong with my name on my boarding pass. It didn’t match with my passport. And lo, it’s true. It didn’t match. And they couldn’t let me through. Unless I did a name change. For €160 euro…

€160 euro!!! For an administrative issue that wasn’t an issue on three occasions before! Outrageous!! But if it was the only way, then let’s get with it. And so I pulled my card and was ready to pay…

And then the nonsense deepened… Although the guy advised me this was the only way, he was unable to get it done. On the phone (with whoever), time was ticking along… Until time was no more. And we were denied to board because Oompa Loompa was, well…

I, then and there, left in Amsterdam, as night was falling, with my family with nowhere to go, made a vow never to spend a single cent on Ryanair again. Even if I had to find a return flight and Aerlingus, or KLM, or Lufthansa, and I had to fly across the world with 10 stops on the way, and would be charging me €1000 euro, Ryanair will never see my business again.

I am writing with reference to my recent transfer experience with “Ryanair Transfers” from Vienna airport to the Hotel Post City Centre.  I booked a private transfer for my friend and I because, being “ladies of a certain age”, we wanted to get to our hotel safely and did not want to worry about catching a train or bus at 9 p.m.

At first the pick up went smoothly and the driver was polite and pleasant.  At some point the driver turned off the Main Street and was immediately surrounded by police cars and uniformed  officers. They said that he was working illegally and that we could not continue our journey.  They also said we should “hail a cab” in the street to continue our journey. Exactly what we didn’t want to do and at further expense. Welcome to Vienna we thought …….

I subsequently cancelled our return transfer as I had lost all faith in the service and couldn’t get in a car knowing it might be illegal and therefore, uninsured.  This once again incurred an extra cost to return to the airport. 
My credit card showed ET Car Hire London.  'looking4transfers', cartrawler, and Ryanair are all involved somewhere but it is impossible to find someone responsible. My advice is to avoid Ryanair Tranfers at all cost - using an illegal and uninsured driver could have fatal consequences - beware ....."

Guess what? We had to back-track, one by one, while they checked us back """"in"""" to the airport, and then had us move the the neighboring gate. It was a disaster, everyone sweating and trying to remain civil. SO awful! The other back experience was en route back from Barcelona. The plane was about 30 minutes late, with no personnel to let us know what was happening. When staff actually showed up and people queued up, they walked the lines looking for people whose bags might be too large according to their MUCH SMALLER bag size limits - I found out the hard way that my good quality bag purchased specifically for carrying on (and I'd used as a carry on for at least six prior flights, including the inbound Ryanair flight!) was a fraction too large to fit in their """"box.""""

Most of the complaints on here relate to airport issues that all the airlines suffer from, and the baggage catch.  The shop tag may say your bag is a certain size, but often the wheels and concealed handle are not counted (the tag often refers to capacity) and once you start filing it they can balloon in size.  There are always bag size racks around the baggage drop area when you turn up at the airport.  Test it there.  If it doesn't fully fit, then you are gambling on whether the gate is going to apply checks.  Go online, purchase the correct luggage size rather than the gate fee.  

Otherwise, the gate staff take a quick overview at the line of people and estimate whether there will be an issue with cabin locker space, especially if there is a high number of priority people looking to get an oversized bag past the gate thinking priority equals entitlement.  If there is a call for volunteers to put their bags in the hold and you have any concern you are over size (remember the wheels) volunteer and avoid a size check!!!  Often staff walk up the queue, if they enquire about your bag it means they are guessing it is going to fail the size check.  If you are offered a free hold transport but refuse, that's why you end up being the one having bag size checked.  

The other main issue is people not checking in online before arriving at the airport and getting stung at the desk.  This proceduree is now common across most airlines with high costs for those who still somehow manage to miss the blunt plain loud and very clear warnings pre-booking, during booking and through emails post booking.  If the app or the web site isn't working, then get screen grabs for evidence and get written confirmation at the check in desk.  There should be half the flight with the same problem, so the issue will be well flagged on the system for refunds.  The local policy to charge has to be implemented in order for the computer to issue a boarding pass - or maybe you'd be more comfortable with anybody being issued with a boarding pass with ZERO security.

I suspect many of the claims made here of check in fees not being refunded have a back story - if the website or app is down, you wouldn't be the one sole passenger affected.  

Seat spacing is due to the type of aircraft and the Ryanair Boeing's are actually more generous than Airbus aircraft.  Stretch your legs out under the seat in front, there's a huge amount of space there if you look for it.  

Budget flights including main carriers these days are flying buses.  They are point to point with no ceremony or fantasy.  You are nothing special going by aeroplane, you're just one of hundreds of millions that fly every year, you are not a VIP, a rock star or celebrity.  Stop expecting to treated as such and show a bit more respect for all the staff that make such easy access to real travel freedom happen."

10.1401643753052,-0.661882638931274,"Ryanair Flight Delays",1,"We flew a round-trip flight on Ryanair between Rome and Mallorca a couple weeks ago. We should have read the many bad reviews before booking this portion of our trip. 

I strongly encourage people to believe the one-star reviews below. I would also caution business travelers and people with flight connections to avoid the added hassles of a Ryanair flight. Based on our experience, we will go out of our way to avoid Ryanair in the future.

It's worth noting that we fly extensively for personal and business reasons. We occasionally fly low-cost airlines and generally have no issues with the experience. But this felt very different.... sloppy in too many ways with elements of a """"bait and switch"""" operation. Low cost actually means low quality on Ryanair. 

First, our flight was the only flight on the monitor showing """"delayed"""" and the Ryanair personnel had no idea where their plane was, when it would arrive, and which departure gate we were using. They didn't really seem to care either. We arrived in Rome almost two hours late and our plans for that night fell apart.

This “penny pinching” airline appeared to become “money grabbing” as our plane started boarding. The gate agents finally stopped talking to each other and looking at their phones and became singularly focused on measuring roller bags that clearly fit in the overhead and charging an additional gate check bag fee. Believe the many reviews, last minute bag tagging at the gate is one way this poor excuse for an airline extorts money from ticketed passengers.

My well-traveled bag was in the overhead on the flight from Rome to Mallorca but the person at the gate in Mallorca said it wouldn't fit on the flight back (same plane, same overhead). She made some comment about the gate agents in Rome not doing their job (not kidding) and said my bag wasn't going on the plane in the overhead.

I was forced to let her tag my bag and charge me an additional $78. Btw - I was holding a “priority” boarding ticket which provides for early boarding and two carry-on bags. None of that matters when the only goal is to extract more money from a ticket holder. (Note: """"Priority tickets"""" are not worth the extra money. Don't do it.)

So, I paid and then I rolled the bag onto the jetway, but no one was there to take the bag. I rolled it onto the plane and placed it in the overhead with that gate check tag still hanging from the bag. Note: I also contacted my credit card while I was sitting on the plane and started the process of disputing the charge.

Next the onboard crew spent our entire flight selling stuff to passengers, first lottery tickets (which no one bought), then duty free perfume and cologne. They also sold drinks and snacks. I've read that Ryanair keeps the majority of the proceeds from the lottery tickets while telling passengers they are raising money and giving it to a worthy cause. One more thing to avoid on Ryanair. 

While the flight crew was highly focused on selling stuff, they didn't do the basics of inspecting the plane between flights. The mess on our plane was in plain sight. The bathroom door lock was missing the knob, and the plane was dirty (food crumbs on the seat next to me, dirty tray tables and some napkins on the floor under the seat in front of me).

This part of the experience reminded me of a story I heard many years ago about a major airline CEO who, when addressing his entire staff said, """"dirty tray tables on the backs of our seats send a message to our passengers that we don't maintain our planes."""" His point was that if they don't do the little things well, why should passengers trust them to maintain the plane.

Ironically, I just saw that a Ryanair flight was evacuated before takeoff on the runway in Brindisi, Italy on October 3rd, 2024, with flames apparently shooting out of an engine. Look it up. Not a great look for the pincher airline."

We began boarding as normal, but were stopped in the hot and humid passenger bridge for about 45 minutes when finally we were told our flight would be delayed for 2 hours. No big deal, it happens. We go back when the time arrives and no one is there to board the plane. About ten minutes before the new flight time a couple flight attendants show up and a rumor of a 6 hour delay surfaces through the flyers. I say a rumor because at NO point did they go over the intercom and make an announcement. It was chaos. So after six hours, which we did not receive a meal voucher for, the flight was delayed another two hours. We lost an entire day in Vienna, missed our next transport to get into the city and arrived at nearly 1am- forcing us to take an $80 dollar taxi. And what is more, as an American there was literally NO WAY for me to get in contact with customer service to request the money back I was dued for the delay by rights. There online platform does not allow for requests that have an American bank and goodluck talking to anyone over the phone. Also, worst landing i've ever experienced."

When at the check-in, we were told there were no seats for us! We had booked the holiday 8 months earlier.

We did not complain to Ryanair because we had once before (the only other time we used Ryanair) in 2020 complained. It was when all holidays were cancelled due to Covid and our holiday then was a Ryanair holiday.

However from the booking to the actual trip has not been easy.
Ryanair do not offer a “package” from Copenhagen to Gran Canaria. Fair enough I can deal with the fact you have to stopover somewhere in Europe and book 2 tickets.
The reason of this review is several occasions with bad experiences and now was the final for me to speak out.
The service at the counter was poor experience a unhelpful lady asked for the final destination and kept repeating the question and to see the boarding pas and I showed her what she asked. At the end she got annoyed and said she couldn’t find the booking.
We showed the other boarding pass with the stopover and she said why I didn’t show that I kindly said because you asked for the final destination.
Well well, then I asked if they couldn’t sendt the luggage all the way to the final destination but that wasn’t possible even both tickets were booked with Ryanair.
I have never in my entire life experience that from an airline. If I would have knew I would never have booked fair enough it might be somewhere in the terms and conditions but honestly every other flight company I’ve used in the passed happily help.
So arriving in Madrid for our stopover was as nightmare and we had to pick up our luggage and check in again. We managed due to our coordination, one ran to the counter the other waited for the bags.
7 minutes before closing for check-in we ran through security till the end of the airport to find out the flight was delayed and here comes the burp. We kept watching the flight schedule and app for updates but no messages about it.
We believed the trains had passed and had to stay for one night in Madrid.

While most airlines provide transparency about additional charges, Ryanair has cleverly concealed the crucial information related to check-in fees deep within the settings of its app. Instead of highlighting this critical detail, the airline's default settings display other, less significant emails, distracting users from the potential added costs that can arise at the check-in stage. This tactic is particularly frustrating for passengers who might assume that the check-in process is straightforward, only to find themselves faced with unexpected charges at the last minute.

Moreover, Ryanair's strategy extends beyond just email communication. The airline often employs a seating arrangement trick that seemingly sidelines more convenient options in favor of squeezing additional funds from travelers. By intentionally placing passengers between two other individuals or in less desirable seats unless they pay extra, Ryanair not only heightens discomfort but also nudges travelers toward purchasing a seat assignment for additional fees. This approach, which appears to be unique in its aggressiveness relative to competitors, raises questions about transparency and customer service. Instead of fostering loyalty, such maneuvers feel more like tactical ways of encouraging repeat payments, leaving many to ponder whether they truly received the budget-friendly fares they were promised."

Agent at the visa desk had to check visa eligibility online!  - and again, this would be fine if check in started early and not almost two hours before the flight. In Dalaman, I was waiting over 2 hours for the check in. Just to get a boarding pass! When the agents arrived, they proceeded very slowly, again, dealing with people who dont speak english and thus delaying the whole experience.
On the plane, the priority boarding wasn't respected and when me and my family showed up to our seats, there were jackets (!!!) stuffed in the overhead lockers which had to be taken in order for our bags to be put in. You might argue that this is normal for a cheap flight / and it may be on a flight for 20-30 euro but not for a 200 euro per ticket flight.

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding the appalling behavior of your staff during my recent experience with your airline. I have been a loyal customer of Ryanair for some time, but the incident I encountered has left me deeply concerned about the treatment of passengers.

During the boarding process, I was subjected to extremely rude, aggressive, and inappropriate behavior by several members of your staff. One staff member was walking between passengers, searching for someone with luggage, acting in a manner that made me feel like a criminal. This invasive approach created an atmosphere of hostility and made me, and perhaps others, feel as though we were guilty of something, which was not the case.

At the desk, a staff member called Emmanuel or Emanuel repeatedly demanded my passport in a bullying manner, saying “give me your passport” over and over, as though I was unable to hear or understand them. This aggressive repetition was both humiliating and deeply disrespectful. I felt as though I was being treated with disdain, which is entirely unacceptable.

Furthermore, two other staff members, one with rich hair and the other wearing glasses, were loudly screaming, and even touched my belongings without my permission. They went so far as to tell me that they wouldn’t allow me to board the plane, which felt like a form of intimidation or even a threat. Their lack of professionalism and hostile attitude left me feeling helpless and harassed, rather than supported as a paying customer.

Instead of offering assistance or advice, these staff members acted rudely and made the experience unnecessarily distressing. I expect Ryanair staff to act with courtesy and professionalism, and what I encountered was far from that. I feel that this treatment is unacceptable, and I ask that you investigate this matter seriously.

I kindly request a prompt response to this complaint and clarification on how Ryanair intends to address this unacceptable behavior to ensure that no other passenger has to experience such a distressing situation.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your response.

PS: the aircraft was dirty and smelly.
To many disappointed points.

Sincerely,

During the flight, I inquired with a staff member (short hair, tall, goatee, average build, tanned skin) about the possibility of moving to an available seat beside my partner. He informed me that the flight was full, and his demeanor suggested a level of disdain. Shortly thereafter, another staff member mentioned that there were indeed two seats available at the front but advised me to wait until everyone had settled in.

I patiently waited and approached the spare seats only to find that the initial staff member was waiting for me to sit down and settle in to only after inform me that I could only swap seats after takeoff. Keep in mind that there were spare seats because someone had already moved to a different location in the aircraft. In the meantime, many passengers were also swapping seats without issue, which left me confused as to why I was singled out. The staff member appeared indifferent to the situation, merely observing the aisle without intervening.

Additionally, I noted at least seven empty seats near my location, which raises concerns about whether he properly assessed the situation. I have flown with Ryanair multiple times, and while I have encountered issues before, this experience stood out for its lack of consideration.

We also decided we will not pay to sit together as it was only a 2 hour flight and kept our boarding passes as non priority.  As soon the very rude woman at the gate saw our boarding pass, we were took to one side like criminals and kept waiting till everyone had boarded and told our bags were too big and we had to pay. After we protested and informed the rude woman the bags would fit under the seat and they are cabin bags as we bought them for this pacific use. We were ignored and told pay up or you do not get on the flight.  ***£120*** later, we were allowed to go through.

We were sat on the front of the plane number one and we were the 1st to get on the flight crew welcome to on board seems very nice but later the flight attendant got very flirty with the captain of the plane, this was noticeable due to the way she was talking to either her friend at the back of the plane or when the captain rang through she was very flirtatious with the body language.
Halfway through the flight, we all asked to put our belts on and not to leave our seats. The captain came out of the flight deck and continued to talk to the flirtatious flight attendant for about 10 minutes, the other flight attendant went into the flight deck which I think is what she supposed to do? The captain then went to the toilet and came out again and stood flirting again with cabin crew. People are wanting to go to the toilet, an elderly lady got up from one of the front seats to go to the toilet and she was told to go to the other end she was not allowed to use that toilet. The attendant was very abrupt with this poor lady who was a bit wobbly. 

People were complaining around me that it was very very inappropriate for the way the captain and the  female cabin crew were behaving . when the captain went back to the flight deck the two attendance sat in front of me on the phone. I’m not sure who you with but with a body language of both of them it was the captain the two male flight attendant carried on tidying up and all this.
I do think the way that they were acting they were like two silly little school children they are in a role of responsibility for everybody on the plane, especially the captain which the way he was behaving the remarks from other people behind me were saying that’s what you get with a budget airline. I have flown with Ryanair many times and had a good flight.

The Ryanair opened the gate, but there was no disabled sit provided after the passport control so I have sit front of the desk wait for arrive the delayed flight, and to the boarding to be start, because I am not able to stand and wait for hours. When the actual boarding started I walked to the passport control desk, but they did not let me board saying I was late. I told them I unable to stand and no disabled sit provided after the passport control, but the Ryanair staff was impolite and refusal to help. Eventually they refused my boarding and ordered me to go away. I told them I have hospital appointment next day, which is about my near future operation.

My concern some aviation officials do not care Ryanair airline discrimination policy will be effect all type of travel opportunity for disabled passengers. Today Ryanair use discriminating policy, next time another big carrier do the same, in the end disabled people has no chance to travel, because companies like Ryanair, do not want to provide the necessarily service for disabled passengers.

Our original departure was 21:10 however flight was extremely delayed with no one present in the Romanian airport to advise on what was going on and with the gate screen having having a completely different flight info on it plus the app still showing the old departure time - leaving everyone in the dark/confused. Once some airport staff sheepishly appeared (last minute obviously) the gate finally opened and it was complete chaos with locals pushing and shoving, millions of kids all over the place, pushchairs ramming us etc. (We have two children ourselves so fully understand how difficult it is travelling with children, but this was completely crazy). We paid for priority but didn’t get it, the airport staff attempted to put a sign up, which was completely ridiculous as by this point it was a free for all. Next… We managed to physically board the aircraft at 21:45 how we we didn’t take off until 22:50 due to the outrageous and quite frankly embarrassing argument between the cabin crew and the airport staff on the aircraft, in full view of passengers. The airport staff had apparently not provided the aircraft with toilet paper. A female local member of the airport staff who was trying to liaise with the captain and crew, was met with what I can only describe as a pack like cabin crew. They were rude and extremely unprofessional towards her, with them all joining in, rudely confronting her and so forth. They were using fowl language behind her back and laughing between one another, even imitating her accent at one point. I was absolutely mortified and felt extremely uncomfortable being of different ethnicity myself, to witness someone being ridiculed for their accent whilst speaking English - I’d be interested to know how much Romanian they can speak? The toilet paper finally arrived with a cleaning lady entering the plane with her products, that they then refused to pay making jokes saying “I’m not gonna pay for it” and “see, how difficult was that?” There are ways of doing things and that wasn’t the right way. On board the actual flight itself there was no hot food or sandwiches available, limited snacks and no ice. I spent ages preordering my meal deal on the flight before taking off, when the trolley service started Nicole had no knowledge of my order saying the devices weren’t working. Overall it was a dreadful experience. We paid extra for priory which we didn’t get. And we were delayed by 1hr 30 minutes. I contacted Ryanair customer service once home - which unsurprisingly was a complete waste of my time and energy as they sent me the bog standard template of “we take your feedback on board” and “hope you’ll fly with us again in the future”.

Disgusting behaviour.  Unfortunately we were travelling to visit family this September flight delayed an hour..  a group of 4 young blokes who were all clearly well tanked up were allowed to board one of them ended up vomiting all over seats before the plane took off  should have been removed from the flight.  Then another delay as crew had to move people from seats and clean up after the selfish drunk, another hour added to the delay and once he was moved from his seat he went on to be sick all over other seating and also put a toilet on the plane out of use.  I asked if these people are fined for their  behaviour, cleaning costs and delaying the flights not to mention that because of the late flight some passengers would have missed their onward travel from the destination.  No one knew.  Its not a cheap airline, I would hate to travel with them again."

the trip back though was a nightmare, firstly the plane was delayed by around a hour and half but that happens.

so waiting for the plane, the screens in the airport showed the delay but the app didn't update at all.

getting in line for boarding is where the real issue started, my friend had a suitcase and he was singled out that it was too big even though it fit in the box and the zip was over hanging, we could see lots of people had bags bigger and did not get stopped, the only difference was he was black, the way they talked to him as well and did it loud enough that everyone could hear completely embarrassed him, he paid the 30 euro even though his bag clearly fit, he felt and so did a lot of customers that he was racially profiled and picked on because of the colour of his skin...

once boarding the plane, the staff looked annoyed and angry, i asked if they would be selling the duty free to which i got a smug look and no we will not be in a stern voice from the head stewardess.

then the pilot refused to take off unless 3 people from the front of the plane moved seats to the middle, my brother who had paid for his seat moved and was annoyed... no thankyou from the staff but he needed to get back as early as possible to get to work next day.

the stewardess was then over heard making fun of a customer that needed a seatbelt extension, which was completely unprofessional.

its not the first time flying with Ryanair and I have always had ok but obviously budget experiences but after the racially motivated treatment of my friend and the unprofessionalism of the staff on board I will never fly Ryanair again, there was 17 of us and next years lads holiday we will be going with tui"

We have traveled with them so many times and to be honest, It does not feel anything else than a proper airline like British Airways. Here is an overview of what you should expect:

Check-in at the Ryanair desks:

At Stansted, there are self-check-in desks or a face-to-face check in too. There are extra charges for bags;

10kg- £12 - £30 online and £24 - £36 at the airport (depending on the time you booked and the destination) per flight

20kg- £19 - £60 online and £45 - £60 at the airport (depending on the time you booked and the destination) per flight

They are very strict on the bag's weight and if it exceeds more than 0.5kg more than the bag allowance, they will ask you to pay £12 per kg.

The handbags, which are one bag free per passenger, also have to fit in their allowance, which is 7kg and 40x20x25

The cabin baggage, which is the bag that is allowed with you on the flight has to be max 10kg and 55x40x20.

Flight;

The flight is smooth, with turbulence at landing and over the sea. The products on Ryanair flights do have a pricey tag. I recommend taking snacks and filling an empty bottle after security. At landing, it was pretty Okay. For the people who make the meme of the firm landings, I partially disagree with it. Ryanair's fleet is the 737 family, which is designed to have firm landings and a firm landing also helps stopping faster, which is good for the plane as Ryanair operates in smaller airports unlike Heathrow, which has longer runways. It assists the aircraft with a faster stop, lowering the risk of overrunning the runway.

It is highly disappointing that I was asked to pay an additional fee for the same luggage, which met all the size and weight requirements during my outbound flight. The inconsistency in baggage policies and enforcement is not acceptable and has caused unnecessary stress and inconvenience.

Moreover, I found the baggage check-in facilities at Agadir to be old, worn out, and damaged. The equipment's condition raises concerns about its accuracy and fairness in assessing luggage dimensions and weight. I strongly believe that the condition of the facilities contributed to the unjust charge.

As a surplus the boarding time was delayed ( about 20 minutes ), and at the same time they were boarding another flight to hamburg, now the lady at the desk taking care of the boarding is been very unprofessional, probably is because my English or accent, but she wasn't being professional with a customer and she decided that I couldn't go because she didn't like me Now as matter of fact this is a really obvious lack of respect for the customer, an obvious case of negligence from your side and I'm ready if necessary to open a suit or a complaint with the department of transport.

The airline is geared towards self-service by apps. You are expected to check-in online using the Ryanair app. We checked-in at 24hr before departure. We observed that the Ryanair tried to use every opportunity to upsell, to ask you to select seat (in order to seat two bookings together), otherwise, it will try to assign middle seats that are distributed randomly across the aircraft. As the Ryanair is always pretty full (through low price), it is advisable to check-in as close to the online check-in close deadline (e.g., 2hr before departure). You may have a better chance to secure an isle or window seat that way.
At the airport, there is an express luggage drop area. You are expected to use the app to scan a barcode to check-in your luggage. The unmanned station automatically weights your luggage, associate the luggage with a particular ticket, and then printed out a luggage tag which you will then attach to the luggage handle. The luggage check-in counter is again unmanned. You will then place the luggage on the belt, use an unmanned scanner to scan the luggage tag, and the luggage will be automatically checked-in. 
At the boarding, there are two lines. Those who paid for priority + two bags can use the priority line, and put one luggage in the overhead bin. Others will use the other line, and board later, and need to place the personal bag under the seat in front of you. The Ryanair boarding is through two staircases, attach to the front and rear gate of the aircraft. 
On board, it did seem that the Ryanair seat is closer. The seat does recline, and there is no seat back pouches, so that the distance between the seat is shorter, and thus the guidance of the length of the luggage is 40cm, instead of the usual 45cm. It seems that the Ryanair personal item guidance exactly fits the seat space under the chair.

I was extremely nervous because of the renouned publicity about their strict rules on baggage sizes and if a single cm out you have to check luggage into hold. I went to very frustrating lengths to buy the exact approved under seat sized piece of luggage and measured my suitcase for overhead locker with extreme care to be sure it would not be rejected. I had priority boarding so could take a single piece of hand luggage for under seat and an overhead cabin locker 10kg piece of luggage. I also had fast track check-in. Owing to a security staff shortage I had to get to airport 3 hours before instead of 2 so was expecting a fiasco of  procedure on arrival. As it happened, I went straight through as had already checked in online so had online boarding passes and the fast track was as it said on the tin, FAST TRACK! I decanted my essential lotions and potions into the 100ml max airline travel bottles that I previously bought from a £ shop. I had them in a clear zip up bag and put in the security tray with phone, personal bag and chargers and suitcase in another. Nobody even looked or assessed the size of my bags!!! I went through all that anxiety for nothing. I did notice people going through with much larger personal bags and 10kg sized bags. I can categorically say theirs did not match the stated size requirements but mine did and that was my only concern as I did not want to be told last moment I had to pay an overpriced excessive charge to check it into hold. My advice to all Ryanair travellers is don't take the risk. But do buy FAST TRACK, well worth the extra price. The plane had very generous leg room,I felt compared to other airlines. Very comfortable seats and staff efficient, polite and friendly. The best thing with these budget airlines is they 99% of time always leave bang on time as they run to super strict time slots. We took off both ends on time and it was super efficient both ends, Stanstead and Krakow. On board service fast and efficient.  Great air conditioning too. Would rate it a 5 but gave a 4 star rating due to the anxiety I had over luggage and then everyone seemed to wander through with any old size."

I flew from Catania to Naples that was due to depart at 8:25, so I arrived at 7am at the airport and lined up in the queue for baggage drop having already done the online checking.  The queue was so long and moving very slow but we patiently waited in the line, while a couple of times, the guy at the counter shouted names of the cities to urge passengers onboarding the flights to those cities.  We were extremely attentive so are very sure that they did not say the name """"Naples"""" or """"Napoli"""" but in any case, the guy only shouted the name of those cities once or twice so there was no way of people missing that moment for some reason to know that their destination had been called for expedited onboarding.  
The time then passed and our last check-in time for baggage drop was nearing but still our destination Naples was not called.  We were starting to feel increasingly anxious and when they called out the name of Venice, for which the flight time was later than ours, we rushed to the counter and told them about our flight.  To our enormous surprise they said the checkin for Naples had been clased so there is no way we can drop our suitcases.  We got so upset but there was no way we could give up so easily, so we kept on pushing  the counter staff to help us, in the end, he told me to bring the suitcases to security and ask the guy to let us with the suitcases.

On 19 July 2024, the Crowdstrike IT failure hit airlines and airports all over the world. Stansted Airport near London was particularly badly hit, and Ryanair handled it particularly badly. My wife and I arrived quite early (>2.5 hours before flight time) to find large crowds and long lines milling around with no direction from staff. Since we had a US passport, Ryanair would not give us a boarding pass via their app. But nor did they ever manage to get people checked into their flights - the chaos was unabated for hours and by the time we reached someone we could talk to the gate for our flight was closed. At the time, airport staff promised us a refund, since even though the flight did take off (a bit late, and mostly empty) we had been prevented from boarding through no fault of our own. I was given a xeroxed paper with contact information to claim that refund. On 20 July I followed up with Ryanair customer service, via chat - and was told, in writing, that missing the flight was not our fault and that a refund would be forthcoming as soon as the airline had finalized a protocol for the unusual circumstances. This would happen within 10 days.

I kept following up. I was then told 14 working days. Then 30-45 days. And then, finally, I received an email informing me that """"Please be advised that Ryanair takes no responsibility for delays (including delay in airport function) caused by the global IT outage as this was caused due to extraordinary circumstances beyond Ryanair's control."""" 

In short, we provided with you no service, told you compensation would be forthcoming, and then changed our minds and kept your money. And yes, we lied to your face more than once -- but hey, as noted in a follow-up exchange, we """"empathize with your view."""" 

I have no empathy with Ryanair, but I do sympathize with their frontline staff -- whom management decided to have lie for them and then undercut. I hope they get a bonus from the money CEO O'Leary effectively stole from me and presumably many, many others on that day.

I am aware that anyone flying Ryanair is making a known bargain with their reputation in exchange for cheap (though in this case only cheap-ish) flights. I don't expect to deter anyone who has decided to accept that risk. I can only say that I will never make that tradeoff again."

Departure was delayed one hour, no problem, and instructed to go to the Gate and wait, as others did likewise. After some time I looked at other passengers around me and we were now concerned. I went to the Ryanair desk to be told the flight had departed from another Gate. Naturally, I was shocked, but not enough to kill me, but close. The polite lady, although sympathetic told me Dublin Airport Authority constantly changed Gates and Ryanair was not responsible. The lady told me the change of Gate was announced over the Tannoy. I  and others did not hear it. due to the low volume and background noise in the area. I was told to be very attentive and constantly go to the Ryanair desk. Another lady, perhaps thinking I was senile, """"Watch me"""" she said, """"when you hear me blow into this mike, pay attention, as I am about to speak"""" and putting her lips to her hand mike, she blew!
Fortunately, I was put on a later flight to Stansted but it cost me 100 Euros and to say the least, it is unfair, and at most, robbery.

We immediately filed the complaint on 29th of July, then we received a very backhanded negative response stating that they did not detect any errors at their system and they won't refund us.

It is far from transparent with its pricing and charges and will do all it can to rinse you out of more money at the last minute and before you fly. Throughout our entire holiday booking process we were informed we could take 1 item of hand luggage on the plane hence I took a small cabin sized suitcase (55x40x20) and we paid for my wife to have a large suitcase. All was fine until the day before our travel date and the online check in opened. Only then are you informed that you cannot in fact take your small suitcase on with you unless you pay for a priority ticket or pay a charge in order to book your case in at the check in gate. Only then are you told you can in fact only take hand luggage onboard that can slide under your seat and with a measurement of 40x20x25. They appear to deliberately leave it very late in order to catch you out and leave you with no choice but to pay the additional charge which on this occasion was an extra £65 (£27 out but £38 back). I found this very sly. Once at the gate, the gate operative was very unhelpful to the point she tried to charge me more by trying to upgrade my small suitcase (which fell within the measurement guidelines) to a large case as it didn’t slide easily through the size guide. It fitted and I had to argue that the case complied with THEIR guidelines and felt they were being pedantic after my case merely touched the sides. To compound issues even more, we didn’t want to pay for seat reservations as again it felt like another hidden charge and we’d always been seated together on other airlines. Once the check in opened there were plenty of seats left available so continued to download our boarding passes only to find we had been seated apart and at opposite ends of the plane. The plane was not even fully booked. There was no common sense in this at all. It just feels like this was deliberate spite because we didn’t reserve and pay in advance. I have never use Ryanair before and will not use them again. It’s no wonder that international reviews rate them the worst airline due to hidden charges and poor customer service.

I recently flew with Ryanair on the 4th of September departure time was meant to be 19:55 but didn’t depart until 2 am which is officially 6 hours from our expected departure.
20 minutes before we were meant to be boarding the plane we received messages regarding a delay for our flight. There was not a single staff member who knew what was going on. We were told it had something to do with the weather and air traffic but witnessed and have proof many Ryanair and other flights were taking off and landing. Realising we now had to stay in one section of the terminal that only had 1 food place was atrocious if we even received a message an hour before saying we were going to be delayed we could have stayed in the main terminal with other shops.
There were two of us on this return flight back to Birmingham we both became very anxious and felt ill/migraines/nauseous from how long the wait was to get home. this is because as it was getting later we had to cancel all transport back home after landing, This is because of the 5 hour delay. Ryanair sent out four euros to each passenger when i received this text I thought it was a joke as we were in the airport for 5 hours what were we meant to buy especially when we physically could only go into one shop to use it!
Moving our departure gate was stressful for both of us as we became worried that our luggage was going to be lost or moved onto an incorrect flight this did not happen although at the time it was all we could think about. Just as our plane landed and they were getting prepared for us they were loading our luggage onto the plane we received an email saying we could request a refund as we hit the five-hour delay. We could only receive this refund if we didn’t board the plane, this makes absolutely no sense as we receive this as we were boarding the plane after previously already waiting five hours and witnessing our belongings going into the cargo hold. If we chose to claim our money and not board the plane our luggage would have already been on the plane so that made no sense at all. 
The best bit about the flight was when we landed and a crew member apologised about the delay and said they had an “unexpected flight “ before us that they needed to do this, means the blame should not have purely been the weather! This made me and the second passenger very angry and never want to fly with you again as all we received was €4 and to cancel and receive our money back as we were already boarding!

At this point the next flight is in 90 minutes so i just say okay i will pay full price. However the flight was not showing up online and the stand at Edinburgh was not an official Ryanair stand they said so we would have to call to book it. I call Ryanair and explain the situation and they said it would be an additional 50€ just for booking on the phone plus another 60€ again cause the flight was in under 2hr so online checkin was closed as well.

Having traveled extensively across Europe, I have never encountered such appalling treatment of passengers as I have at this airport.In particular, the way pregnant women and parents with small children are treated is unacceptable. They are forced to stand and wait for the doors to open for boarding, which shows a complete lack of consideration for their well-being. Additionally, the staff are excessively aggressive when checking baggage for size discrepancies. Even a single extra centimeter seems to warrant an additional charge. For example, I was charged 69 euros for carrying an ergonomic backpack that has back support.This kind of practice is far below acceptable customer service standards. Every time I fly from Riga, I am shocked by the terrible attitude of the staff, leaving me with a very negative impression of Ryanair airline.

Threatened to Remove Me from the Flight Over 1cm

I’ve traveled with Ryanair many times, using the same suitcase without any issues. However, on my recent trip From Liverpool, I was told my suitcase was 1cm over the limit, and they charged me £75. Even though I’ve flown with this suitcase around 10 times before, the staff were completely inflexible and downright rude.

I even offered to leave the suitcase behind and bin it, but they refused. Then they told me I had to either pay for the suitcase or they would take me off the flight. At this point, I started filming the situation as I felt I was being treated unfairly, but the staff escalated the situation by threatening to call security if I continued recording. They also told me they would kick me off the flight unless I deleted the footage. Under pressure, I deleted the video right in front of them, but they still insisted it was somehow still on my phone.

The way the staff handled the situation was completely unprofessional and unacceptable. Ryanair needs to address how their staff treat paying customers, especially when it comes to minor issues like this. I will seriously reconsider flying with them again after this experience."

One of the female officers approached me with an angry expression and said, """"Albo ty kładziesz na tacę, albo nie lecisz, zrozumiałeś?"""" This was not only rude but also unprofessional.

The crew member, whose name was Carlo, responded in an extremely condescending and rude manner, saying, ‘Can’t you see we’ve been serving passengers since takeoff? I haven’t had a moment to rest.’ The lady next to me told him that we had been on the plane for two hours and that I had requested water three times. Carlo shouted at her, saying, ‘We’ve only been flying for one hour,’ to which the other passengers responded that we had indeed been sitting there for two hours. He then said, ‘If water is the only problem, I’ll bring you some, but it will cost you three euros.’

I requested random allocated seats, fully understanding that if there were not two stars together we would be seated apart. My 16 year old daughter was allocated a seat in row 18, next to an emergency exit, I was allocated a seat in row 3. I accompanied my daughter to her seat first, and was very thankful that I did, as a female member of the air cabin crew started questioning my daughter's age, and implying that she was too young to sit in that row. My daughter found this quite worrying as she didn't understand what was going on. I said that we could sit behind in row 19, as it was empty, but was told the flight was full. This was not true, there were lots of spaces with both doors closed at this point. My daughter had a space next to her, so I sat there as she was quite scared at the idea of being in charge of the emergency exit should an emergency arise. This was because of the demeanor of the staff member towards her. I don't understand why Ryanair sat us separately with no need, obviously a money making exercise, trying to encourage people to pay for allocated seats. More so, I am concerned that an unaccompanied 16 year old girl was allocated to a seat which over sees the emergency exit, and she was then scared by the staff member.

This has been an incredibly stressful and upsetting experience, and it is clear that customer care is not a priority for either of these organisations.

I flew from Malaga to Rome on flight FR6139 and was supposed to connect to a flight to Catania (FR4856) the same day. After arriving in Rome, my checked luggage did not arrive on time. I waited for 1.5 hours for my suitcase, but it did not show up. Because of this delay, I missed the opportunity to collect my suitcase and had no choice but to board my connecting flight to Catania without it. This was not a decision I made lightly, as my yoga teacher training course, which I have waited over a year to attend and paid $7,000 for, was starting that day, and I could not afford to miss it.

Upon arriving at Catania Airport, I immediately reported my missing suitcase to the Lost and Found desk. However, instead of receiving the required Property Irregularity Report (PIR) number, which is necessary for filing a missing luggage claim with Ryanair, I was only given a reference file number. This number does not allow me to proceed with the claim process with Ryanair, who refuses to assist without the proper PIR number. This failure to provide the necessary documentation has left me unable to recover my luggage.

Since then, I have been caught in a frustrating loop of unhelpful responses from both Catania Airport and Ryanair. I have spent several hours each day trying to resolve this issue, only to be met with indifference and a lack of accountability from both parties. The ongoing lack of assistance has caused immense stress and anxiety, as my suitcase contains essential items and personal belongings needed for my training.

This experience has been a nightmare. The negligence and incompetence displayed by both Catania Airport and Ryanair are unacceptable. I demand immediate action to locate my missing suitcase and provide the necessary PIR number so I can formally lodge my claim. I expected much better service, and the complete disregard for customer care is disgraceful.
I urge anyone considering flying through Catania Airport or with Ryanair to reconsider, as their handling of lost luggage is appalling. This situation must be addressed promptly, or I will have no choice but to pursue further action."

I've had the misfortune of flying with ryan air 3 times and every single time something has gone wrong. The first time was for a return flight for a work trip. They canceled my flight and didn't even bother to notify me. It caused me to wait at the airport for 3 hours in different lines only to find out that my flight was canceled and they offered me absolutely no compensation besides a 20 dollar food voucher.. So there I was stranded in an airport with no promise of a different flight and no hotel compensation. Thankfully my employer paid an insane amount to get me a first class flight home with KLM later that same day but the most ryan air offered was a refund for the flight. DO NOT BOOK WITH RYAN AIR unless you want a chance of your entire vacation being ruined by an incompetent airline. Ryan air advertises as a cheap airline but then they charge you at every turn. Want to reserve a seat? You have to pay for it no matter what seat. They only allow one small bag as carry on where other airlines let you bring a small coffer and a small bag for FREE but surprise surprise ryan air charged you for that 1 small coffer if you opt to bring one. Want to have check-in luggage? You guessed it, you have to PAY so don't think you're getting a cheap flight because they will milk you for monet at every turn and unless your flying alone and don't need luggage it's not worth it. Also the other two times I flew with ryan air was not out of choice. I booked a 10 day getaway for my partner and I through a travel agency and only found out that the flight was with ryan air after the booking had already been confirmed. We had to pay around 300 euros EXTRA to reserve bad seats so that we could sit together and so that we could bring any luggage at all so we would've been better off flying with quite literally any other airline. I also want to mentioned that they advertise as a punctual airline but they were one and a half hours LATE on both of our flights with them(to and from our destination.) I've flown with KLM, delta, TAP, air lingus, air canada, transavia and many more airlines and I fully understand why ryan air has the reputation that they do. Book with ryan air at your own risk. One time I flew with TAP and they were 30 minutes late, which caused me to miss my connecting flight to my final destination and they booked me the earliest flight they could find (next day) and they also booked an extemely luxurious hotel stay for me that night(which included breakfast), paid for my taxi to and from the hotel and provided me with a free dinner voucher. This is how an airline should treat you when they make a mistake but ryan air doesn't care about their customers at all, they only care about money. We all value our vacations so please I'm warning you don't trust Ryanair with the outcome of your holiday because there is a very high chance that they will ruin it for you by being the incompetent, disgusting airline that they are. Fly with air lingus if you want cheap flights, they are miles better, it's not even comparable. The one star I'm giving them is because we didn't crash."

I have been a regular customer of Ryanair for several years, frequently traveling with my family and friends. However, the incident that occurred during this flight was both distressing and humiliating for me and my family. During the flight, my seat was assigned separately from my wife and children. My wife and children were seated together, while my seat was a few rows behind them. As my young child was feeling anxious, I moved to an empty seat next to my family. I politely requested the air hostess, Emily, to allow me to sit there and even offered to pay any additional charges if required. However, Emily completely disregarded my request and spoke to me in a rude and unprofessional manner. She also made derogatory remarks about my appearance and threatened to remove me from the flight or have me arrested if I did not return to my assigned seat immediately. This entire incident occurred in front of other passengers, causing extreme embarrassment to me and my family. The rest of the flight was extremely stressful, and my child is still traumatized by the experience. I cannot tolerate such racist and inhumane behavior. I request that a thorough investigation be conducted into this matter and that appropriate action be taken against Air Hostess Emily. If I do not receive a satisfactory resolution, I will be compelled to take this matter to the court and other relevant authorities.

And, being a passenger and knowing that if you act badly you can get kicked off a flight or you see people being arrested, we all sat quietly fanning ourselves and hoping that it would be over soon. We were there for at least 45 minutes in a hot oven. Approximately 45 minutes later a bus shows up and we were all herded out of the metal oven on the buses to go out to our plane . Not only was this treatment unacceptable but I’m really surprised there wasn’t any medical emergencies in that metal tube while we waited for 45 minutes. I am a seasoned traveler, having traveled to over 50 countries. I’ve had good flights. I’ve had bad flights but I have never ever been a situation that felt dangerous because  of the treatment we were given. There was absolutely no excuse for what happened."

When I booked my trip I specifically purchased my baby an extra infant seat, confirming with the booking agent and posted policy on Ryanair’s website that this would allow my baby to use his aircraft approved car seat on board. 

Upon check-in, I again confirmed that our car seat would be allowed on board. It met all of Ryanair’s specified criteria: forward facing, 5 point restraints, within dimensions to be installed in window seat with armrest down, carrying approval seal for use in aircraft.

On boarding, the flight attendant quickly confiscated the seat, instructing me to hold my baby in my lap for the entire flight. My purchased extra seat could not be used as my baby did not have an appropriate child restraint system since the car seat was taken away.

The seat belt sign was on for nearly half the flight due to turbulence and my active 1 year old was not safely secured in a seat the entire time. He was crying and had to be pulled away from the seat in front to avoid having him kick and grab at the passenger in the row ahead. 

I have used this car seat on multiple flights in N America and EU without issue and it is in fact consistent with EASA guidelines that infants be seated in child restraint devices, including car seats, during air travel. The refusal of the seat on board this flight was also in contravention of Ryanair’s own policy.

I have flown on numerous low budget airlines around the world and understand that you get what you pay for. However in this case Ryanair actively refused to provide what I paid for (purchased seat on board for my infant) and enforced unsafe aviation practice.

During the boarding process, a staff member—who was polite and courteous but extremely persistent—attempted to charge me an additional 60 euros, claiming my carry-on luggage was oversized. It’s important to note that this was the exact same bag I used on my outbound flight FR1143 from Lisbon to Berlin on August 14, 2024, at 05:55, without any issues.

Despite my efforts to comply, including removing some items such as flip-flops, the staff member refused to re-check the bag’s size using the measuring device, insisting the problem was related to the """"weight of the flight."""" Yet, after making this claim, she allowed me to board the flight, which proceeded without any issues whatsoever. The flight and the journey were perfectly fine—proving that her initial concerns were unfounded.

It became clear that the staff member’s primary objective wasn’t to enforce baggage regulations but rather to extract an additional 60 euros. After multiple failed attempts to pay with three different cards, including one belonging to a friend, she finally allowed me to board without the charge when she saw how visibly distressed I was—almost on the verge of tears.

We had booking a flight from Athens to Santorini on 23.7.2024. The flight was at first delayed for 2 hours and then cancelled last minute. I absolutely needed to be at Santorini at 24.7 morning which practically forced me to book another flight by another company last minute (as you know last minute bookings are always more expensive). Had I known that i wouldn't fly with Ryanair I would have booked the other flight well in advance and paid much less money. Ryanair is 100% responsible for the cost difference between the two ticket which was about 30€. Unfortunately my flight was approximately 9 hours after my Ryanair original flight which forced me to stay at the airport for almost 11 hours total, since the cancellation was overnight and there were no metro services and also Ryanair did not hold any responsibility regarding transfer services compensation which should be expected for an overnight cancellation. Moreover, I had to stay without food for 11 hours because Ryanair did not hold any responsibility regarding food coupons either and airport food is rather expensive not to mention unavailable at said timeframe. I arrived to Santorini 9 hours later that i had anticipated and planned and also hungry and with 0 hours of sleep, my mood was practically ruined and I ended up wasting half the first day of my trip trying to take some rest and relax after your terrible services for which no one at the airport would neither take responsibility nor explain. 
Not only was my trip ruined but my terrible experience continues even a month later, since I had made several attempts to get refund for at least the ticket price (which is the absolute bare minimum a respectable company would provide refund for). The refund application form was not working and giving us a different non sense excuse every time (for example the customers name is not right, the flight was not cancelled, we have received a big amount of applications and cant help you at the moment etc.). After a whole month of trying we contacted the chatbot who gave us a different link for another application form and told us that the link we were using (that we had found on the no-reply emails your Ryanair was sending us) was wrong. We took a last shot to reapply for a refund and the final response was that the cancellation was not Ryanair's fault or responsibility thus we are not entitled to a refund. 
Overall 100% horrible experience, I could spend hours callin Ryanair every name in the book since it not only ruining my mood for a much anticipated trip but also made the refund process so complicated and after all impossible. Cancelling a flight is one thing, however taking 0 responsibility over it and providing 0 refund to the customers that trusted your """"company"""" is another.

My mother and mother-in-law were left stranded in Barcelona after Ryanair overbooked their flight. After paying an additional 70 euros upon arrival at the airport, they were allowed to go all the way to the gate, only to be informed that there were no seats available for them. The lack of communication was appalling, and despite promises of accommodation, refunds for flights, taxi services, and complementary food, none of these were fulfilled.

They were forced to wait for five hours before being put on a flight to a different airport than originally planned. This ordeal tarnished what was supposed to be a special holiday and led to them missing an important wedding. When they finally arrived home, they were faced with an additional £200 taxi fare, adding to the mounting costs of what should have been a straightforward journey.

To make matters worse, the promised refunds have yet to materialize, and the so-called complementary food was nonexistent. Communication with Ryanair has been a nightmare, with each reply taking a minimum of two weeks. They have repeatedly refused to communicate with us directly, despite the booking being made in our name, through our email, bank, and Ryanair account.

The overall service has been nothing short of shocking. The way Ryanair has handled this situation is laughable, especially given their self-proclaimed status as a top airline. I would strongly advise anyone considering flying with them to think twice. This experience has been a complete disaster, and I am left utterly dissatisfied with their service.

Once again, our experience with Ryanair was nothing short of a disaster. They had, yet again, oversold flights, adding unnecessary stress and chaos to our journey. To make matters worse, they kept the check-in closed until just two hours before the flight's departure. With multiple flights scheduled to depart around the same time, the queue was absurdly long—stretching what seemed like a mile.

The situation became so desperate that we had to push through the crowd just to have a chance of making our flight on time. I would be absolutely astonished if fewer than 100 people managed to catch their flights on schedule amidst the disarray. This is simply unacceptable and speaks volumes about Ryanair's complete disregard for its customers' time and peace of mind."

Started with the check-in, I think nowadays it’s even worse than before because this company purposefully separates the family in order for you to buy the seats. This is a scheme of course so they can receive more money. From my end, they will never see money coming out of my pocket to buy seats.

I just had a simple bag, only with a change of clothes and toiletries. I use this bag for all my flights because it fits perfectly under the seat. And guess what? Of course there was a lady from Ryanair that stopped me to put the bag on the measurement. (I guess nowadays only if you leave with a book on your bag it’s the only way for you to not be stopped lol)

It fitted, but she insisted that it didn’t (I will attached the photo of the first attempt of the bag fitting). But well, she picked the wrong person because I wasn’t gonna pay for sure.

I was scheduled to fly to Spain, but on the morning of 9 August, I received the heartbreaking news that my daughter’s mother had passed away. Naturally, this devastating event meant that I couldn't go ahead with my planned trip, including the return flight to London.

Hoping for some understanding during this difficult time, I reached out to Ryanair’s customer service. What I received, however, was a generic, impersonal response that completely ignored the gravity of my situation. There was no acknowledgment of the loss I was facing - just a cold, impersonal reply directing me to fill out standard forms for refunds or compensation.

I was stunned by the lack of empathy, so I followed up, expressing my disappointment. Unfortunately, this only led to yet another canned response that closed my case without any meaningful resolution. It was clear that Ryanair had no interest in providing actual customer support or even engaging with me as a person.

This experience has been incredibly disheartening. I understand that Ryanair is a budget airline, but the way they handled my situation was beyond disappointing—it was unacceptable. It’s clear that they value their customers solely for the revenue they generate, with no regard for basic human decency.

They have a slightly different weight limit for big bags which can make it a real challenge if you have flown into Europe from the United States, as now you have to figure out how to shift things around.  Further, even when paying for bags up front, they find ways to scam you out of more $.  When we checked my larger pre~paid bag, we also asked if we would be good to go with the other bags we had and had paid for in advance.  The person who checked my bag said we would be good.  
However, there was a sourpuss of a person who gave us a hard time at the gate.  She insisted we needed to pay an additional $46 for our bags.  Ironically, the person who checked my larger bag at the beginning of this travel segment was also at the gate and she also said she did´t understand either, but told us she the sourpuss was higher status than she was.  Then, to add insult to injury, there was a woman of similar looking nationality/ethnicity who had 4 bags who was also challenged by sourpuss, but sourpuss let her board with three bags after she condensed (clearly making her bags exceed the size restrictions).   
Then i tried to inquire online to ask for a refund, and they dont have a drop down for my situation.  So, I went on the chat, only to see I was number 174.   I waited over 45 minutes and finally connected with someone who asked me to describe my situation.  15 minutes later she told me there was nothing I could do via chat and to contact the complaint center.

Not wanting to give up feeling that I was being taken advantage of, I sent in a full description of my concern and even included a picture of the woman with the three bags.   I received an fairly quick rejection reply.  I commented that this was unfair and unjust, and received another rejection and a note LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING YOU NEXT TIME.   
So, I warn you this airline looks for ways to abuse travelers and make them pay for even more bag costs, even when we had already paid for 3 bags.  Further, not sure why they have a customer service chat or online submission if they are simply going to reject any part of my query and slap me down.     
The flight was fine, albeit it the cabin was overly hot until we were almost 30 minutes into out short 2 hour flight.   Their ground personnel includes people who walk around with sourpuss faces and treat the customers sternly without any apologies.  Lastly, they should rename their customer service chat and online systems as we~dont~give~a~sh_t~about our customers as they are not apologetic.   They get a ZERO out of 5 stars in my book and I would rather pay more with an airline that doesnºt try to steal more of your money at the actual gate and that has true customer service standards that may not agree but at least show they value your business.

We were forced to pay again for the same service and experienced significant inconvenience due to this oversight. This is a blatant Ryanair mistake, and yet both Ryanair and Looking4.com are refusing to take responsibility, offering only unreasonable excuses.

This is beyond frustrating. I’ve asked repeatedly for this issue to be escalated to someone who can have a reasonable conversation and correct this obvious error. This is one of the clearest examples of a Ryanair cock-up ever.

I explained that I was travelling with my wife and 3 kids and it was easier to use the app but she was furious at me, shouting for me to hurry up ! She then pointed to our 5 bags and said 'sir you need to pay 46 euros for each bag, please move to the side' she never spoke a word to us after that. She shouted at her colleague and demanded him take our payment of 230 euros. She ignored us completely to the point my wife was in tears in front of our 3 kids not really knowing why she had acted in this way. Her colleague apologised on her behalf several times saying she was very aggressive today because she had worked a long shift the day before because of the software crash. The Ryanair cabin crew had seen my wife was upset and tried to comfort her when we taking our seats. To be fair the cabin crew were fantastic! 
Overall it was a horrific experience and I am annoyed my wife was left in tears and my kids witnessed the whole thing not to mentioned being charged 230 euros. Not how a holiday should end and as a result I will definitely not use this service again.  : ("

Seats: Reserved in the second row with priority check-in

Online Check-In Issues:

I attempted to complete the online check-in via the Ryanair app for two days before the flight, but the process did not work. Strangely, the first passenger (under the same reservation) was checked in without any additional cost, while the second passenger incurred a surcharge of €55.

Customer Service Experience:

I contacted Ryanair's customer service multiple times and spent hours waiting in line for a chat with an operator named Patrik. Unfortunately, Patrik was unable to provide the necessary information for filing a complaint. Instead, I was given links to submit claims for issues such as illness, bereavement, delay, or cancellation. 
Despite repeated attempts to get the correct information, I was only met with the same incorrect responses.

Resolution:
Given the inadequate assistance and the failure to resolve the issue, I am now considering seeking legal advice. Ryanair's customer service has been extremely poor in this instance. I believe the company should not only refund the surcharge caused by the system error but also compensate for the inconvenience and consequences suffered due to this situation.

Overall Rating:

I rate Ryanair's customer service very poorly based on this experience. They need to improve their support system and ensure accurate and helpful information is provided to their customers."

We have just flown home to England after an incident at Arrecife Airport in Lanzarote with Ryanair. 

We were due to fly on Wed evening (27th July) at 18.55. The flight was delayed by half an hour and as soon as the gate opened we queued to get on the plane as normal.  (along with everyone else) 

As soon as boarding started we could sense there was an issue, as the boarding staff starting arguing in Spanish, but we obviously didn’t understand what they were saying. From there they started bringing some children  and their families through ahead of everyone else queuing, which again, we thought was strange. Then, after waiting approx 45 minutes at the gate, they suddenly closed it. 

They then announced that the gates were closed and the rest of us were not getting on the flight. 

There were 37 of us left behind, including a family that had been split up, a lady’s husband and one of their children had got on the plane, and the lady (with her other child) were stopped. Her husband had all their money on the plane with him, and all their hand luggage. She was in tears, there was a lot of confusion, upset and frustration. 

The 37 of us were told to go to the office to find out what to do, bearing in mind, our luggage was still on the plane at this point. 

At the desk, they did not want to help us. They explained that there was an argument between the local government and Ryanair and Ryanair was making the point that they don’t have enough time to get everyone on.
This then, was making the planes late for every journey. So decided to close the gate during boarding. 

We all believe that they were using us as pawns in their argument. 

The plane was still on the ground an hour later while they took our luggage off, in which time we could have got on. 

It then took off with 37 empty seats. 

There was no clear justification for what they did to us. 

At the desk they shrugged their shoulders and did not offer to help us. The only option we had was to buy new tickets to fly home the next day, at a cost to us. But we had no where to stay. 

All 37 of us were just left in a foreign country with no help. The Ryanair staff were very cold and uncaring of the situation they had left us in. 

I believe that we were the victims of a dispute between the local government and the airline. 

It was mentioned too, at the desk, that this could likely happen weekly to passengers until it’s resolved. This was explained to us by a one of the passengers who could speak Spanish and was translating for us all. 

We are now home, but only because of an extra cost of around £500 to us, and this was because we managed to find a room to stay in in the local area and flew back the following day. (1st Aug)  Luckily we took a credit card with us for emergencies but not everyone is that fortunate. 

We have had absolutely no contact from Ryanair. NO email,  NO apology, NO guidance of what we need to do. NOTHING!!! 

I’ve tried calling customer services 4 times over the last few days, and emailed 4 times, but they don’t want to know. One response was automated accusing us of not being at the gate on time. I’m furious!    They are rude, arrogant and hostile when speaking to them, and I keep getting referred back to the online forms for cancellations and delays which neither cover the issues we had.

I understand that airlines need to enforce rules, but this seemed excessive and downright unfair,especially given the circumstances.It felt a blatant cash grab rather than a necessary policy enforcement.

So he told us to go to the Ryan Air customer service counter to ask for help, which we did. We went back down to the counters, where only one guy working there. We went up to him and requested help as we were unsure why our tickets were not working. 

However, his attitude was extremely poor for someone working in customer services, especially at the front of a help desk. He did not even bother looking at us or our boarding passes and said, """"Why are you here?"""" we told him multiple times that we were unable to get through the gates and that security had told us to come down to ask for help. He responded with """"Go back upstairs, why are you here"""" and we said again that we had been told to come down. He then continued ignoring our pleas for help and told us to go back upstairs or go to the check-in counters, despite us saying we'd already checked in. He proceeded to raise his voice and said that we were being unreasonable by saying that we needed help from him, not once had he tried to help us or even look at our booking to figure out what was wrong with it, he had just sat there with his arms crossed looking like he did not want to be there, at a customer service help desk, where his job is to help customers. 

I proceeded to ask for his name as I had wanted to lodge a formal complaint against his abysmal attitude. He then raised his voice and said, """"why do you want my name?"""" I said I just wanted his name for the record to show proof of his extremely unhelpful conversation with us and he proceeded to scold us when we were already anxious about missing our flight. We decided that arguing with him was a waste of our time as he was not providing any support in any sense and left to go back to the departure gates to ask the security guards. 

Another security guard at the departure gate looked at our tickets and told us we were supposed to fly from Barcelona Reus Airport rather than Barcelona. We were grateful for this information even though we missed our original flight because someone had helped us rather than this guy sitting at the counter whose job is ironically to help customers but he did nothing of that sort.

Instead of providing any sort of compensation or even an apology from the customer service desk I had to pay them more money to get on the next available flight. £100 for the courtesy, and plus another £100 for a hotel room at the airport as that flight out that I missed had been the last of the day. I wasn’t the only person in the same boat, there were at least 10 others. So Ryanair made at least an additional £1000 from us poor fools. Totally unfair and unjust. They have people over a barrel and they know it. Because it was less than 3 hours delay legally no leg to stand on to make a claim. Also very strategically they don’t allow people to book two legs in the one booking which would constitute failure to provide service booked.

Yesterday I was part of the flight from Paris - Beauvais to Lisbon FR1084 and after performing the check-in the day before, a seat was assigned to me and another one to my girlfriend. Yesterday at the airport though, when we tried to scan our QR codes, it didn't work and by going to the check-in we figured out an overbooking happened and our seats were taken (we didn't pay for seats, they were assigned randomly but we also were not informed that not paying for seats would present a risk of not onboarding). We were given another boarding pass without seats and with a """"standby"""" signal.

The airport was a complete chaos and after managing to go through all the queues and talking to the receptionists, we just waited on the side for everyone to come in to see whether seats would be left open to us or not (there were about 3 other couples in the same situation).

All the """"standby"""" people were at the queue around 16.55hs (flight departure was scheduled to 17.10hs) when the receptionist started checking seats available and a family who was not in """"standby"""" arrived very in a hurry because the airport was completely packed (there were even a lot of people outside of the airport). They were then informed that they couldn't onboard because the gate was closed, but actually there were still a lot of people outside of the aircraft waiting to go in and even ourselves in the queue inside the gate. Everyone got very nervous. We were told to go and they were left behind. We've just got a feeling that we were the ones taking their seats but my flight was bought 4 months ago. I don't know what happened to Ryanair system but the whole situation was completely unfair to us, to the employees there and even though the company is responsible for the overbooking, the airport for the chaos as it clearly cannot accommodate that amount of people, all of this situation was at customer's expense as Ryanair sold more seats that what they had and claimed the gate was closed while the family seats were given to us who suddenly lost the seats but had bought the tickets a long time ago.

Honestly if available, I prefer paying a higher fare to another company who provides a better service because the feeling I have everytime I perform a check-in with them, is that they are just waiting for us to fail when selecting seats, luggage, insurance or whatever to rip us off. Yesterday I had complete proof of how unfair they are because even though they were responsible for the overbooking, the customer who paid for the error. I'll do my best to always buy short distance tickets with other companies and if I need to pay more, I'll pay it happily because I know I won't be contributing to such a badly intended company.

Please do yourself a favor and opt to spend some extra money to avoid being abused by rude and careless gate agents and personnel. By the way, this flight was not even so cheap …  My flight was scheduled to depart at 7:25 am from Edinburgh to Rome Ciampino from gate 21. There was a long line of passengers who like me opted to pay the priority rate to be allowed to bring on board a carry-on and a small personal bag. Before being able to board, passengers were asked to place their luggage in a measuring container. My carry-on fit perfectly, but the gate agent said it was slightly wider than the box allowance and I had the option to either make it smaller   (??? - it is a hard plastic suitcase!) or pay extra 75 pound sterlings (!!). I tried to explain that this was a regular carry-on size (by the way half empty as I was in Edinburgh for only a couple of days) and complained about her request. As I was complaining (of course, I was not happy about this nonsense) she threatened me not to let me on the plane because she said I was being rude to her. She actually said: “You are not flying today!”. There were many other passengers in my same situation, but the gate officers would not budge. On the contrary, she “punished” all the passengers who were asked to pay extra money, by letting all the other passengers in line board the plane before us (including all the passengers who were flying economy and spent less money).  We were left with no other option than being quiet (or we were threatened not to be allowed on the plane) and paying for a carry-on we had already paid for. By the way, at that point we were rushed because we had to get on the plane and I was not even given a receipt for my charge. Shame on Ryanair for putting their clients in such an uncomfortable position and for encouraging their workers to abuse passengers. I feel I was abused by a sadistic gate agent that enjoyed feeling powerful by putting travelers in a difficult and submissive position. By the way, Ryanair administrators, if your company has any valuable standards, I would identify the gate officer that was in charge of boarding passengers on July 30, 2024, gate 21, flight FR5589, leaving Edinburgh at 7:25 am.

It was so bad the flight was supposed to be at 9:25 am and the line was so long for check in. we asked to go to the last minute counter  because the line took too long. and they only let us go to the last minute counter when we were almost through the line for check in. then the employees in the check in counter was shouting at us to go back to the veryyy long line and it would’ve taken us another 2 hours. then they said we had to pay 165 euros for 5 people because we were “late” and it was 35 euro per person and this was a very big cost. Then, we payed and went to the security. we told the people working there that we were about to miss our flight then the same thing happened. she told us to go to another line, then the worker in that line started shouting at us. By the way they are shouting and speaking in spanish as if we are understanding them. We asked a worker where the gates are for the airline and she didn’t know so a woman standing in the line had to explain to us , which was very helpful. (Very weird that the customers know more than the workers). Then when we say we don’t understand, they get more mad. we finished through the security , then ran through the duty free to see the gate. number. It turned out that our flight was delayed to 11:35, which was 2 hours later. That was a good thing because we were about to miss it. But the gate information didn’t come out for another hour and a half. 
We waited and went through the duty free, only to find out our flight was delayed to 2:30 pm and at the time it was 9:45 am. We were very mad, as we payed a late fee and got shouted by many employees only for the flight to be not for another 5 hours. A lot of time passed and we found out that we got a compensation of 250 euros per person which was very good, although it’s the least they can do. Also, turns out they canceled the compensation and we didn’t get our money back, and we also wasted 165 euros for NOTHING.  After a while, they announced that the flight got delayed to 3:30. Having it delayed many times, it was normal, but it made us very mad and tired since we were at the airport at 7 am. After more time, They announced the boarding to start at 4:20. With no surprise, the boarding didn’t start till 5. We waited at the line at the gate for around 1 hour and they kept telling us to stay behind this line and squish us like ants. We waited for the people from the plane to deboard, which took 20 minutes for no reason. Then waited another 10 minutes for them to remove the bags. We finally boarded the plane, only to see the flight attendants shouting at the passengers. Very disrespectful. We were on the plane for 15 minutes after everyone boarded, ONLY to find out that we had to stay still for another 15 minutes. At this point it was 6:30pm (9 hours after our flight was supposed to take off) Overall this experience was HORRIBLE and i wouldn’t recommend this to anyone as there are better budget airlines. The workers are very rude, irresponsible, unorganized and impatient. Overall this airline is so unorganized and they keep apologizing which does nothing.  This flight was from barcelona to malaga, which is an hour and 15 minutes on the plane. Like all of this for an hour and 15 minute flight??? The delay was for 9 and a half hours which i could’ve drove in the meantime. I had to drive to Marbella for another hour after the flight, which was delayed. It was raining while the flight was delayed, which i thought was the reason, until they told us they had to “rescue” passengers from the Napoleon. I paid a lot for my vacation, only to have a whole day wasted because of some unorganization and poor planning. I had an invitation and booking a few hours after we landed, which is gone and i couldn’t attend. They gave us €4 vouchers for water??

Initially, the pilot informed us that we could wait as the storm might pass. However, due to a difficult passenger on board, and after what seemed to be less than 5 minutes, the decision was made to divert the flight to Rzeszów where police were waiting to handle the situation.
Upon arrival in Rzeszów, the Ryanair staff quickly left in taxis, leaving us passengers without guidance. The airport staff managed to arrange one bus, but many passengers, including myself, were left without any provided transport. We received a message instructing us to organize our own transport and that we would be reimbursed.
Given the late hour, nearly 4 AM, five of us struggled to find a taxi or bus. I contacted companies provided by airport staff but all of them had only space for 4 passengers or they were closed during the night. I am glad I did not take two taxied as it would be £600 .Ultimately, we paid approximately £300 for a taxi to Krakow which I stoped on airport .I have since submitted a claim for reimbursement of this expense, but Ryanair has declined my request, stating that transport was provided where we have proof they send us messages to do it as airport staff is struggling to find transport. O also ask airport staff to speak with Ryanair what does it mean reasonable expenses and after speaking to Ryanair they said taxi is ok as there was nothing else at this time. Also the cost should be divided by 5 passengers. I contacted people who were on that flight and some of them had refunds and some of them didn’t so clearly Ryanair is lying to their customers as they responded to me that transport was provided."

Not only was the flight delayed, which was possibly unavoidable, but passengers were made to stand outside of the terminal before the plane had even landed. When the plane eventually arrived, after the aircraft was disembarked by the previous passengers, we were then allowed to board. During queuing to board the engines were been tested and I boarded from the rear of the aircraft. Having no choice but to stand on the steps, as people awaited to board, the tanker was emptying the toilet waste right underneath the steps where customers were standing, the smell of human waste and fuel was enough to make some customers, including children physically sick. On boarding the plane, my seat was covered in rubbish(snacks and crisps)and an empty pop bottle, the plane, obviously hadn't been cleaned prior to boarding, which brings into question the possibility of contamination and the spread of viruses, such as Covid. I have personally boarded military aircrafts more sanitary than this during operational flights. The cabin lights were also on throughout the whole flight, when the cabin staff were asked, why? By a passenger next to me, the flight attendant was rude and simply said, """"That's the law, look it up online if you don't believe me.""""

After waiting another 20 minutes, we had just 60 minutes left to catch our plane. We decided to try the other lane, and after another 20 minutes, we found out that we had been in the wrong queue the whole time. They issued my wife's boarding pass there and said we should have come sooner.

I ask you to publish this feedback about our experience with Ryanair: """"Our family used Ryanair for the first time and we were very pleased with the prices and service, Thank them! The only thing that upset all of us at the beginning of the trip was that Ryanair didn’t send an e-mail that we needed to register online in advance and when we arrived at check-in an hour and a half before departure because of a big queue and paid a fine of 165 euros for check-in at the airport. We thought that, like in other airlines, if you need to check in online, you will receive a separate e-mail about this. For us this was a very large amount and we were all very worried that this happened. We understand that it is our own fault that we did not carefully read all the airline rules that are listed on the website. But as an exception for the first time, we kindly asked Ryanair to credit us with these 165 euros as a voucher (even not a refund) so that in the future we can buy airline tickets from their company! But they declined! We hope this feedback will reduce the amount of dissatisfied Customers of Ryanair"""""

I downloaded the app. On the flight to Zadar it told us it would be delayed til 7:30 (so I thought the app was the best thing to check) because the boards at the airport didn’t change. It kept saying gate info at 5:20 and said this til way after 6:30. On the flight back from Zadar I kept an eye on the app waiting for any info on delays. Nothing. 4:00 comes by (our departure time and no gate info on the app) we look up at the boards and it says go to gate 6. Another hour goes by and no communication. The app says the flight is on time well it is clearly not because it should’ve set off an hour ago. This sort of thing causes too much stress. It’s supposed to be an enjoyable time. I have anxiety about flying as I had a seizure on a plane a few years back and the lack of communication was terrible. I’d say I’d never fly with this airline again but let’s be real, they are all as bad as each other. 

Also, how come there’s no hot meals left on te plane by the time they reach a third of the way in?

Disclaimer: we didn’t fly from Leeds to Zagreb however the website wouldn’t recognise either of the airports so thanks for that aswell.

5.08239936828613,3.1787281036377,"Airline Fee Complaints",1,"I wish I had never sought to save money trying to book through this budget airline because I wound up spending over $830 for “inexpensive” flights. My and my partner originally purchased flights from Italy to Malta, but changed it due to the brutal heat wave happening. We switched to London and paid the $56 hour change fee even though the new flights were significantly less expensive than the original (no return of difference). No biggie. 

Then the day of the flight, we got to Marco Polo airport and realized our flight was from Treviso. Our mistake, but then we tried to change it online as you are supposed to be able to do (paying a change fee and fare difference if applicable each time). Could not do so on the website or app. Also could not connect to a chat agent, perhaps due to high volume. So we tried to find an agent at the airport and we wandered that place for about an hour going back and forth. First off, for some godforsaken reason, there are no maps in the airport to tell you where respective airline ticket counters are located (there are three separate locations on two floors— we went to all of them). Next thing is that that information is also not on the itinerary or Ryanair’s website. We finally found Ryanair’s check in counter and bag drop, but the agents could not change tickets! They said we had to purchase new ones.

This is where I made a mistake because I was in a rush. I purchased the next day by accident because the flights I saw earlier sold out while we were trying to resolve the issue online and at the check in counter. We quickly checked in via the app and went back to the counter, where the agent realized we had the wrong date and THAT is when he told me I could go to a ticket counter upstairs to try to change my ticket. What?! Why didn’t he say that before and why are the check in and ticket counters in separate areas on separate floors? When I went upstairs (where there are multiple single booths that service various airlines, again you have to look for them as they are not clearly marked), the ticket agent said we could have paid a fare difference/change fee if we hadn’t purchased the new tickets. Which was what we had tried to do, but couldn’t and had been told by another agent to purchase new tickets. Of course they could not refund me and they suggested I contact Ryanair online to see if they could issue a refund.

I reached out again to Ryanair via chat and at first received the message that they could not assist due to high volume and to try again. When I did so, I was placed 334 in the queue. Finally someone responded, I told them the situation and he said Passenger error, no refund because they could not make a change without cost or cancel. What did that last part even mean? I reiterated that I purchased new tickets instead of exchanging them because of the lack of online assistance and as directed by one of their agents and I wasn’t looking for a full refund or cancellation of all flights, just either the cost of the original tickets or the current tickets to rebook with a change fee. I also asked what he meant by they couldn’t change without cost or cancel, but the agent bailed and said he had to abandon the conversation since he told me all he could. I suspect it was because he couldn’t actually explain what he meant in English.

You’ve been warned by all the other reviews here. Ryanair may be the cheaper option if you have no issues (or luggage), but if you do, those costs will add up fast and they won’t even have any free snack or beverage service on board. Their information as to boarding, ticketing and customer support online is very limited. They expect you to make all steps yourself online via the website or app from booking to changes to check in (which costs a ridiculously hefty 55 euro fee per person at the counter just to check in in person— PRICE GOUGING!), and if you have any issues such as wi-fi connection, long online customer service wait times, or unavailable online agents or wrong instructions at the airport, you pay a very big price. The customer service agent you speak with may also have limited English. Please don’t get me wrong, I do know multiple other languages and this is not an American-centric view that English should be spoken by everyone. But as it tends to be the global language for business and tourism, it’s a pretty big issue your representatives can’t engage with clients and convey correct meaning."

8.15400791168213,1.81449437141418,"Ryanair Baggage Policy",1,"The role of customer care in the airline industry is as important as its operational aspects. Efficient and empathetic service not only assures customer satisfaction but also builds long-term loyalty. Unfortunately, my recent experience with Ryanair’s customer care has been nothing short of appalling. From inconsistent luggage policies to deplorable behavior and unfounded charges, Ryanair’s approach to customer service appears to prioritize monetary gain over genuine care for its passengers.

Inconsistent Luggage Policies

Having traveled with Ryanair multiple times using the same luggage dimensions without any issue, I was shocked to encounter the """"10kg luggage challenge"""" during our recent holiday at Manchester Airport. The situation did not just stop at enforcing a rule; the manner in which it was conducted was unprofessional and demeaning. Even more disheartening was the behavior of the Ryanair staff, including their supervisor, who exhibited a disturbing lack of empathy and professionalism. This inconsistency not only creates confusion but also erodes the trust customers repose in the airline.

Focused on Finances Over Customer Care

Ryanair’s predominant focus on financial gain was further underscored by their handling of a family emergency that necessitated a booking amendment within 24 hours of the purchase. Instead of showing understanding and flexibility, I was met with unreasonable fees. Given the minor nature of the amendment, one would expect some degree of leniency, especially under pressing circumstances. Yet, even in times of emergency, Ryanair’s policies remained inflexible and punitive. These practices suggest a model that sees passengers not as valued customers but as mere revenue sources.

Inadequate Customer Service Mechanisms

Adding further insult to injury was Ryanair’s inadequate customer service mechanism, consisting largely of impersonal, automated chat systems. In moments when human interaction and empathy are most needed, the airline offers robotic responses that do nothing to address genuine customer concerns. This lack of a personal touch exacerbates the frustration of dealing with an already unresponsive service, making the entire experience even more alienating.

A Call for Accountability

Given the extent of the issues encountered, it is clear that Ryanair’s customer care policies warrant significant scrutiny. One potential course of action for affected customers is to seek judicial recourse through county court proceedings. By leveraging the legal system, we can ensure that Ryanair is held accountable for its inadequate service, thus compelling the airline to reassess and reform its customer care practices. It stands to reason that consistent pressure from a legal standpoint might drive substantial change within the organization, ultimately benefiting all current and future passengers.

Conclusion

My distressing encounter with Ryanair underscores a critical gap in the airline’s approach to customer care. From inconsistent enforcement of luggage policies to automated, impersonal service channels, Ryanair has demonstrated a significant disregard for customer satisfaction. Only through systemic changes and possibly legal accountability can we hope to see an improvement in how the airline treats its passengers. It is imperative that companies remember that the essence of their business is not just in making profits, but in building lasting relationships founded on respect and quality service."

Then had problems checking in online 3 phone calls later was told it can’t be done ,but they would make sure it was all sorted when we got to each airport . Bristol was fine checked in no problem , coming home from Palma airport was a different story . Went to check in and nothing on the system and if we wanted to get on the plane we had to pay £230 euros . Showed all the documentation we had from Ryanair and they just didn’t care or want to help and as my wife is disabled in lots of pain and we have 5 children one with autism we had no choice but to pay . Have emailed Ryanair since coming home and they are refusing to refund . Next special assistance which we arranged for my wife and my autistic daughter . My wife has arthritis and fibromyalgia so struggles to walk long distances, Bristol was pretty pointless we had a gentleman walk with us but my wife also had to walk no wheelchair like requested .arriving at Palma  airport we couldn’t get any assistance. Arriving at Palma airport to get home we had to wait over a hour and half for a wheel chair but no special assistance. And when we explained we need the help we got no where, so I had to push my wife through Palma airport which is a big airport .

My partner, our child and I were checked in on-time for the flight (over an hour early). Our bags were on board, and we were waiting to board. The gate kept saying boarding but then it said closed and we lined up to board, however they kept delaying the boarding. It happened 3 times. The app reflected no delay and the front desk was not providing any information nor was anything reflected on the screen above the desk. My partner was ready to board but because of the constant delays he had to use the restroom. At that point the gate didn't say boarding but was closed and all passengers were still just standing in line (this about 45 minutes after the set takeoff time). All of the sudden the front desk announced they were going to be boarding. Mind you, there was no loudspeaker announcement. They boarded the plane and my son, and I were last waiting for my partner to return from the restroom. There were several standby passengers waiting to get on the flight. The individuals at the front desk began pressuring me to get on the plane and board without my partner saying that the doors were about to close and once they closed, we would be left. I pleaded with them that my partner was in the restroom, and he would only be a few more minutes but they continued pressuring me and insisting I make a decision immediately and if I did not we would all be left. I informed them I had his boarding pass, carry-on and his passport and asked if we could board the plane and he would be on right after. They said that was not possible and they had all these standby passengers waiting to get on so we had to make a decision. I again pleaded with them that we are a family and I don't want to leave him, we eventually got on the plane without him and left his passport with the attendatns. The moment I got down the stairs to walk to the plane I saw him at the gate. I ran back up the stairs and pleaded with them to allow my partner on, they snapped at me and told me it was too late, and the doors had closed. He was standing there, and they were giving his seat away. We got on the plane without him, and 15 minutes went by as the standbys were allowed to board. There were more delays because they had to retrieve his bag. My son and I ended up deplaning because we did not want to leave him stranded at the airport. This caused more delays because our bags needed to be found. We ended up having to book a hotel room for the night as there were no more flights to Catania. We had to pay for three one-way tickets to Palermo. The treatment we received at the gate was appalling. They pressured me because of the standby passengers. The lack of understanding and complete disregard by the front desk was truly disheartening. I will never fly Ryanair again and I urge you all to do the same. I would also suggest not to book any transfers through them either. Our transfer coming back never showed up and when I called for a refund they told me to take it up with the driver. Thank goodness my credit card company resolved the issue for me or I would have been out several hundred dollars. For complaints you can email cs.support@Ryanair.com."

People without priority were placed in glass walkbridge in the full sun well before the plain was ready. It must have been about 60-70 degrees Celsius without exaggeration. Standing there for more then 1 minute caused people to break into sweat and there where elderly people and kids in there. After standing there for 10 minutes, people started complaining about the dangerous situation. Personnel opened one door  between the walkway and stairs leading to the airplane, but this hardly did anything. When people mentioned this, the response was to keep waiting, otherwise 'the stairway would have beed blocked for the priority people to go first because that was protocol'. The priority people however were in a shaded walkway and had no issues with wellbeing. People obviously started to get angry.. apparently peoples wellbeing is less of a priority to Ryanair than following protocols. They then said just to push back out of the 30 m long walkway, which was totally filled with people just as the hallway leading to the walkway, so this was not an option. After a lot of discussion with the Ryanair personel, some elderly people and kids really needed to push themselves to the cooler stairway leading to the airplain. Even then the ground control prosonel said to push back insead of front, which still was just not an option. Even after all this, they told us to wait because the priority people needed to go first and they held people in the dangerously warm walkway. People then fortunately ignored this, because some were almost fainting from the heat. They started walking together with the priority people to the airplain. The priority people totally understood since only one look at the sweaty and almost panicing people was enough for them to realize the seriousness of the situation. Then finally the problem was solved just in time before people started really panicing, but not thanks to the Ryanair personnel. @Ryanair: get your priorities straight.

The request for documents were a lot: a utility bill, a copy of my passport, `banking details + a service request information form to be completed. I asked for a refund to my card instead since I booked directly with them. They said no. I received the refund after a big hassle with a $15.00 wire charge. I am not left to book a flight that is considerably more than what I had booked. They held my money for 5 months for the early booking. It's terrible! I read a lot of bad reviews but decided to ignore it because of the lure of the cheap fare. It's not worth it because it will cost you more in the end. Note: the review asked for a flight taken.

Oh yes, it is written somewhere on their site (also that they won't give back a penny for that!), but of course it should had been mentioned clearly (instead of lots of garbage adds in their emails). Therefore I consider this dishonest behaviour and hidden costs. I really don't like dishonesty.

Because my boarding pass didn’t show priority boarding as it hadn’t updated, the Ryanair guy wasn’t going to let me through as I had an extra bag. I explained to him I had just purchased it and showed him the receipt and update on the app, however he still didn’t believe me.

We boarded our flight but unfortunatly whilst on board, the pilot announced that there was an issue with the plane and it would be delayed for an unknown amount of time. We were left on board the flight in 40 degree heat with no access to air con or free water for over an hour. Passengers were provided with no explanation for this and why were kept on board in these conditions which was shocking.

The pilot then stated that the flight would be further delayed and asked us to disembark the air craft due to the high temperatures we were being left in. Our flight was delayed over 3 hours until we then were allowed to board again. 

My partner and I had booked a train from London to Darlington once we arrived back in the UK with a 3 hour buffer zone in between in case our flight was delayed. Due to the 3 hour flight delay, we missed our train and had to buy new train tickets which cost over £100. 

The whole journey was a nightmare and we received an email from Ryanair stating that we would be entitled to compensation for the issues caused.

Since then, I have contacted Ryanair numerous times with regards to this and receiving compensation for our train tickets.  Ryanair have shown no concern for the situation and have stated we are not entitled to compensation which is appalling.

I am disappointed and frustrated by how Ryanair have treated their customers and shown no empathy towards the situation. They provided no explanation for why the flight was delayed and why we were kept on board for over an hour in 40 degree heat, to then be delayed a further 2 hours causing us to miss our connecting train in the UK. I am appalled by this and do not recommend Ryanair as a credible air line. It was clear from the contact I have had with them, that they show little empathy for the situation and do not care about their customers."

By that time, I had already checked in online for all passengers. I contacted Ryanair's call center and was assured by an employee that it was possible to replace the name without any costs and that the reservation would be unchecked to allow modifications. I was instructed to wait approximately two hours before logging in again to make the change.
 
After waiting for three hours, I attempted to log in and make the changes but was unsuccessful. I contacted the call center again and was redirected to the Chat service. I waited in a queue of approximately 300 people for about four hours, only to be kicked out of the system without resolution. As it was very late and our flight was the next morning, I decided to address the issue at the Athens airport.
 
On the morning of our flight, I attempted to contact the call center again, but it was out of working hours. Upon arrival at the airport, I sought assistance from Skyserv, who confirmed they were unable to make any changes and advised me to purchase a new ticket for the new passenger at the price of €437.96 which I did eventually (Reservation MUD2RR). Skyserv assured me that Ryanair would refund the additional ticket cost due to the circumstances.
 
Additionally, at Gate C15, security informed me that reservation under CJYGFC was unchecked, and I had to pay an additional €55.00 for check-in, under receipt CJYGFC-02. Both Skyserv and gate security confirmed that these issues were due to Ryanair’s error and assured me that Ryanair would refund me for these amounts.

Upon our return from Berlin on June 9, 2024, we encountered further issues at Gate B38, where CJYGFC  was not initially found on the manifest. After an internal investigation, he was allowed to board. From what we believe is when I spoke with Ryanair assistant in the first time, instead of unchecking GSNIRE , he unchecked CJYGFC by mistake and this is why all this confusion incurred.

I wrote many complaint forms but they fully rejected and they don't even care for their own mistakes!

When booking my flight with Ryanair I also booked the airport transfer from ciampino to termini with their partner company Looking for transfer in order to save time om the day just in case.
At the moment of booking as the service was available to book I assumed that the transfer service operated throughout the whole day. Only to find out that it stopped at 16.30. My flight was scheduled to land way passed that time so when realised, I asked for a refund. They declined the refund so I'm writing this review to make as many people aware about this lack of availability of their service. And of course, as I booked through Ryanair they knew exactly what my flight details were so shouldn't have been advertising something that they knew they couldn't offer but still happy to take my money.

Our flight was delayed by over six hours with no clear communication or updates from the company. We were left stranded at the airport, not knowing if or when we would ever board our flight. The company didn't provide any compensation or even basic amenities like water or food vouchers during the lengthy wait.

When we finally boarded, the plane itself felt cramped and uncomfortable, with no regard for passenger comfort. Ryanair's relentless focus on squeezing every possible penny out of customers is evident in their absurd baggage policies and hidden fees.

The worst part is, this isn't an isolated incident. Speaking with other passengers, it became clear that delays and poor customer service are commonplace with Ryanair. It's evident that the company prioritizes profit over passenger experience, and this trip was a prime example of that.

Flight FR1317 from Lisbon (15:00) to Naples (19:05). Unexpectedly for most, the flight lands at 18:55, 10 min before expected, too beautiful to be true.
At 19:00 the pilot communicated to us two more flights had landed before us (normality right?) and that we must wait 5 to 10 minutes to have the buses for us to leave the aeroplane. At 19:50 all the people were still kept inside, kidnapped by the company, represented by its hostesses, whose only repeated responsibility was not on them, and we could not leave. The pilot, in the meantime, likely fell asleep. Only at 19:55, exactly one hour after having landed, the buses arrived and people started to be released from 1h kidnapping.
While leaving the aeroplane, the hostesses told me goodbye as if nothing happened. I didn’t answer (to such a joke), but my face likely communicated something. One of the hostesses told me “This is not our responsibility”. I explained to such a person that the company is (YES!) responsible for managing the buses for each flight (something I’ve discovered while struggling with all the other passengers inside, trying to find a solution to leave). After discussing a few seconds with the hostess, the person passed from “this is not our responsibility” to “make a reclaim” to give an idea of the arrogance and ignorance I was facing.

Why is this story worth being public? It does so because is explanatory of how such megacorporations, as Ryanair, have been granted manifold rights of abuse in the countries where they (can) operate. Behind the (relatively) cheap flights, individual rights, even the most basic ones, such as that of freedom of movement, are sold to the hegemonic power of such colossal corps with the compliance of nation-states. At the end of the day, if I’ve lost an important train, bus, meeting, or event I’ve been planning for months or if I’ve felt imprisoned for more than one hour is irrelevant no? The customer has to pay for it and all abuses these companies are granted. At the end of the day, it is all about “Sit back, relax and enjoy your flight” (Ryanair slogan), empty words made by empty people who only value money over basic rights and a future on this planet.

The entire trip was freezing cold. Despite numerous complaints from passengers, the attendants did nothing to address the issue. Adding to the misery, they were constantly demanding passengers to change seats, creating massive confusion and chaos throughout the cabin. Their facial expressions were harsh and disdainful, making everyone feel horribly mistreated.

To make matters worse, there were significant issues with the luggage in the cabin. The attendants were uncooperative and dismissive, adding to the already high levels of stress and frustration among passengers. It was clear that if they cannot perform their job with a smile and basic courtesy, they should consider finding a different line of work.

June 13, 2024 
Vienna-Bologna Ryanair flight FR4769 scheduled at 7:15 p.m. Gate C31 at Vienna Airport. I am one of the last people in the gate line. The flight departure is already 20 minutes late. Out of nowhere, the two airport attendants present at the gate (a boy with long hair and girl with dark hair and long eyelashes) checking tickets, set out to see if the luggage of the last people in line was within Ryanair's small baggage standard. This treatment had not been given to anyone else, either priority or nonpriority. They start speaking in German (which I understand). She says to the other guy while giggling, """"Ah this one"""" - referring to me - """"is oversized with the luggage, I can see it already.""""

She measures my backpack and it doesn't fit. I don't even have time to rearrange things inside the backpack to make it fit within the standard measurements. The girl starts putting pressure on me by saying that the flight would leave without me. In a highly authoritarian and arrogant manner, the attendant keeps repeating to me that """"You either pay or you don't fly."""" I ask why this treatment had been reserved only for me, she replies """"You either pay or you don't fly, complains are not my business."""" Backed into a corner I give my credit card and the girl swipes it so furiously in the machine that the system does not recognize the card. She does this twice. She gives it back to me even more furiously saying """"This card doesn't work, you have to give me another one, otherwise you don't fly"""" I reply """"Try swiping it slower, maybe it works."""" The attendant tries slower one more time, the card works. 

46€ thrown away because I was blackmailed and mistreated by an airport attendant. I entered the plane and my hands were shaking from how shocked I was at the treatment I received from that employee. 

I don't know if she was part of the Ryanair team or was an airport employee. The matter is that there is no such behavior towards a customer, even if the attendant is on the right side. It is not acceptable for a paying customer to receive such treatment. I hope that from this review the person in question will be identified and action will be taken against her misbehavior."

We arrived at the airport around 15:00. We entered the security checkpoint shortly after 16:00. Although there were NOT many people in line but the line was moving extremely slow. The security staff was disorganized, slow, taking their time to inspecting each and every item, reading each label, talking, laughing with each other during the process. None of the staff cared about getting passengers in a timely manner to ensure that people were able to make their flights. The personal was extremely unprofessional, lacked courtesy for passengers. Around 17:00, my daughter’s bag was the fifth one in line to be inspected, she begged people to let her go next. Passengers were under extreme pressure, stressed - one person vomited in the bin with staff watching in disgust, wasting more time, rather than assisting her. I cannot express the terror we experienced during this time. No matter how politely we begged to speed up the bag inspection process, the staff just looked at us and deliberately slowed down. After security, we ran through the maze of stores to the gate. It was 17:35, the gate was already closed. I could see the aircraft from the window for the next 20 minutes. After calming down, we tried to figure out the next step. We learned that our luggage was pulled off the aircraft and we needed to retrieve it from the arrival terminal. Ryanair knew that two passengers already checked in, the luggage was loaded but the gate was closed prior to the scheduled departure. We were told to go to Ryanair customer service, after explaining what happened the women just looked at us, didn’t care. I graciously asked her to check for availability for the next flight.

I asked for a refund instead but she said there will be no refund and that if we decided to book the next flight, we would have to pay again as a new reservations. I asked if she was able to check other airports around London with flights to Poland the next morning and she refused to help, stating that Ryanair does not do that. Of note, there was other passengers talking to Ryanair customer service about the exact same situation. Someone suggested for us to try flights out of other airports. After learning that there was a flight from Luton airport via Wizzair the next morning, we decided to take multiple trains to Luton airport not knowing if there were seats available. We couldn’t book this flight via our mobile phone because there was a problem with the network as our phones operates out of USA. That was our first time in London, we were not familiar with the train system, had difficulty with our phones but we took a chance and headed for Luton airport. Three hours later we arrived, met with a Wizzair staff member, who was able to get us on the next flight to Poland the following morning. The transportation cost from Stansted to Luton was 67 x 2 = 154 GBP. Our tickets from Luton to Poland via Wizzair were 730.98 GBP, together 884.98 GBP = $1,101.06 USD – an unplanned and unexpected cost that we had to pay as a result of the unfortunate circumstances with Stansted Airport and Ryanair.

We had been given conflicting directions by a couple airport staff as to where we could recieve our boarding passes which wasted 10 minutes walking around.
Even with this delay, we arrived on time at the Ryanair service desk #122 to start the check-in process. 

This is where I had the WORST customer experience of my life. 
I have flown extensively for 25 years to over 30 countries, on countless airlines and have never been exposed to such an awful representative. 
We arrived before the cut-off time for our check in.
This was verbally confirmed by your representative (a young girl).  
She specifically told us when we arrived that she had one minute to check us in.....okay, phewf sigh of relief. Nope! 

Instead of starting the process she complained to us that she wasn't fast enough to complete the task. 
She just looked us in the eye and told us we missed our flight. 
Again, we arrived ON TIME!! 

As the precious minute counted away while she coldly began explaining the absorbent cost of another flight the next day.
We were in disbelief.  
I asked her if she could do anything more. 
 
She then had the audacity to ask us if we wanted further help by calling someone???  
""""If we wanted futher help""""????! """"IF""""?! again unbelievable. 

She did this all while smiling, as if our entire trip itineray wasn't hanging in the balance of her typing skills. 

After she spoke to someone on the phone she told us that she couldn't help us. 
I repeat, we arrived on time!! 

The amount of time we spent pleaded for basic consideration, must less customer service, we could have been checked in. 

We only had carry on bags and there was no line up at security. 

We now sit in the airport booking a flight on any airline other than Ryanair to complete our journey.
While we could have easily made our Ryanair flight that doesn't leave for another 38 minutes. 

Completely unbelievable! 
In all my years I have never written a complaint letter. 
I don't even remember the last negative review I've given a business, but this Ryanair representative was the absolute worst customer service experience to date in my life. 
For someone that travels as much as I do that is saying something. 

I honestly don't even know how to make sense of the situation.

The one silver lining was that we went back to the kiosk and spoke with a different girl. 
She was sweet and understanding and was also surprised at our situation. So at least we know some Ryanair employees care. 
It feels as though we got terribly unlucky with that one girl.  
If we had dealt with the second girl in the first place, we would be happily on the next leg of our journey.

Ripoff Ryanair
Why oh why do we all tolerate companies like this?
Paid extra for Priority boarding & 2 cabin bags (along with everyone else, which is just another way for Ryanair to produce revenue for bog sub-standard service.) At my return flight airport i was told i could not use the express bag drop (which i had paid extra for) and that i could not check in yet, as i didn't have the app. I was told to go and wait in a queue for check in to open. Nowhere in any communication from Ryanair did it say that the app was a MUST. I enquired 15 minutes later if check in was open and was told it was and that i should have queued up earlier ?? The queue consisted of every Ryanair passenger on every Ryanair flight - a procedure that must have involved over 600 passengers & took over 80+ minutes to get through. During this some of the queueing lanes were changed allowing people at the back of the queue to jump in front of others -CHAOTIC !!
I contacted Ryanair """"customer service""""and told them of this and their response was :
""""my situation did not fall into any of the categories (which Ryanair determine themselves) that would allow them to offer a refund. I told them i had paid for a service which they had not provided. They said as i took 2 bags on board part of their obligation was fulfilled. Still no movement on their intransigence. DISGUSTING !!"

I made the mistake of booking their car rental (which was delivered by Italy Car Rental) and the service was rubbish. They didn't have the car I booked. The """"upgrade"""" didn't have the satnav I paid extra for, had no water in it, noisy brakes, and had about 100 small dents and marks on it. I photographed most of them before we left the car-park. It was a good thing I did, as on my return they tried to charge me for many preexisting marks until I could prove each predated our hire period. They still ended up withholding €280 for the most trivial preexisting scrape - a mark that was so small I hadn't taken a photo of it (and it would have polished out without any body work required). I had bought separate excess waiver insurance, so I won't be paying that personally, but it still felt like a scam. The couple who returned their car at the same time, but had booked it direct at the airport were not given the same treatment - it was clearly an established routine to gouge people who had used any other insurer (and evidently Ryanair insure separately from the hire).

We arrived as suggested over 3 hours before our morning flight.  It was a Sunday, no strike action or school holidays, so I had no reason to expect anything other then my previous experiences when departing at other UK airports, how wrong was I.  First impressions at the baggage drop were great, no queues and extremely helpful and friendly staff.  How this all changed once we headed to security. 
First there was an unmanaged collection of passengers, who all needed to pass through one of 4 security arches, to enter the area to queue for security.   Once this had been achieved, passengers passed into a large area to queue for a security check.  Due to the large number of passenger, at this point there was no identifiable queueing system, passengers were just standing immediately at the entrance to this area and causing more problems.  There were no airport staff to instruct anyone here.  After 20 minutes, the taped cordons became visible and passengers started trying to following them.  Frequently, new passengers to the area, pulled open the cordons and joined into the queue, effectively queue jumping.  At one point a member of staff appeared but all he offered was to let passengers out of the area, presumably to re-join at the start of this all over again.  From nearby conversations it was obvious that passengers who had allowed time, were getting concerned as the time for their flight neared.  A couple with small children in pushchairs tried in vain to seek help but were told to stay in the queue, as their flight may have been delayed, and there was no attempt to assist them.  
It was total chaos and very unpleasant for everyone.  Once the security point was reached and half of these were closed, staff were gruff and unpleasant.  It was only 8am so goodness knows what they would be like later into their shift.  Once through security most passengers headed to the rest rooms.  Poor old duty free shops, despite their staff trying to attract would be shoppers, passenger walking extremely fast or running by this time, totally ignored them in their haste to reach their departure gate.

I was informed at the gate that my hand luggage was slightly larger and I need to pay extra. Once I paid, a yellow sticker was attached to my bag.  

After I boarded the plain a female flight attendant (her name tag was hidden) asked me about my bag with the yellow sticker- whether it’s for today.   

I considered this question to be strange - did she think it was for tomorrow? Why would I bring a luggage bag with me that is not for today. So I replied - yes, it’s for today.  

She said that I would have to go down the stairs attached to the plain, “find a hole at the bottom” and put my bag there (her literal words).

   I was speechless at her request as clearly this was a violation of health and safety rules. And I was not going to walk around aircraft searching for the “hole at the bottom”. Also there was a lot of people going up the narrow stairs.

  Female flight attendant’s voice and gestures were aggressive, but I decided to abstain from arguments and waited for the people to pass, so I can clarify my further actions. Why waiting I heard a conversation of this female flight attendant with her young male colleague - making derogatory comments about the city of Prague.  

Once every passenger passed, another aircraft member arrived curious as to what was happening. Female attendant said that I don’t speak English and asked him if he can take my bag. The guy tried to speak to me in Czech (which I don’t understand) and I had to briefly explain that I do speak English and happy for my small bag to be taken to the hold of the plain.

  I am considering further legal action as I am not happy at all. I was met with aggressive behaviour - verbal and non verbal, strange questions, demands to find a hole at the bottom of the plain - which I deemed to be very unsafe and just quietly stood trying to avoid further escalation, also waiting for the crowd of people to pass by - as there was no way for me to move anywhere. While waiting for the crowd to pass by I had to listen derogatory remarks about Prague, then mocking my English abilities - as female attendant realised - I will not participate in her aggressive arguments, as she clearly tried to escalate and possibly put me into trouble.

It's obviously not what I'm used to with Delta or American in the U.S., but it's one of the only airlines you can choose from to travel within Europe. I've never really had a serious issue with the airline until today. 

I had purchased a priority ticket and just happened to be the first person in line to board. As the female ticket agent came to check our boarding passes, I had to scramble to locate mine on my phone. I could see the woman eyeing me suspiciously, as if I was in the wrong line. This has never happened to me before and I ALWAYS fly priority. Anyway, I show her my pass and she moves on. Then she brings someone from the back of the line, have them size and weigh their carry-on bag and put them in the line in front of me. Weird but who cares, I'm still second in line, right? Wrong. As we line up in the breezeway to the plane in single file, she comes along tells us all to move to one side. Then she proceeds to instruct all of the white men (I was in front of about half a dozen white men), starting with the one directly behind me, to come to the front to start a second line. This ensures that who knows what number I will be to board since we all know how white men, especially Spanish white men are.

When she returns I address this situation with her and her exact words were, """"It doesn't matter, I can choose whoever I want to choose. You are the only one it matters to. It's ridiculous."""" Oh and btw, I am an African American. I told her that this issue matters to millions of Black people all over the world. She reminded me that """"That's ridiculous.""""

We got to the airport with plenty of time and got to the gate while people were still boarding the flight. As we were travelling with a baby I sent my partner to boarding gate while I grabbed a quick snack for our little one for the plane. As my partner got to the gate and a small misunderstanding of destination (we were flying to biarritz to continue onto pamplona) he was sent away without asking for his name even though we were the last on the list to board the flight.  As I got to the gate the staff proceeded to close the gate and then went on to tell me that he's not their fault that my partner had the wrong place name when he got there. Usually if passengers have checked in there is always a final call but the staff told me he went around and called our name but when a man with a baby approached him he didn't manage to make the connection considering a man and a baby were who he was supposedly calling out for. I literally watched the last person go in from the boarding area as I was walking to the gate.  Now not only were we travelling with a baby but I am always pregnant. There was no attempt by the staff to accommodate us in any way as he literally closed the gate  on our faces. We were told that as policy final call is longer called out as the Ryanair flight next to us called out a final call for another flight.  This flight was booked out mainly by friends and family going to a wedding in pamplona flying to biarritz. No attempt was made to alert last few passengers before closing the gate which is absolutely absurd when we drove all the way from kerry to the airport and were in the airport hours in advance of our flight time with a young baby. I am putting in this complaint in the hopes of getting some answer to how this was allowed to happen and acknowledgements that as paying customers we were treated very poorly.  I understand if we got to the gate minutes later but the time between the scan of the last person in the queue and us was merely seconds of not mili seconds. No attempt was made at all to check if anyone else was coming and then the staff played it off as if it was our fault that we should have been in the queue earlier. No regards to the fact that I was pregnant and we were with a young baby. I'm appalled at the behaviour your staff showed us today. And when we tried to reason with them as they chatted away one of them said """" it doesn't matter what they do it's only just one other complaint that won't mount to anything"""" I wish I had recorded our interaction today. It was a stressful day enough without all this added bad behaviour. We are so furious.

It does speed things up, but there's no boarding by seat numbers so everyone lines up and it's utter chaos. This is worse when you have to bus it to the plane. The 1st bus was for """"priority"""" fliers but it wasn't allowed to go to the plane because the plane wasn't ready. So """"non-priority"""" fliers hopped on, as well. Chaos again. 
2) The seats - They're not ergonomic. It was only a 2.5 hr flight and my back hurt afterwards. I couldn't sleep or rest. There isn't even a pocket at the back of the seat in front of you where you can stuff your water bottle. 
3) Check in online - If you don't check in online, you have to pay an airport check in fee. What's up with that? This is part of what another reviewer was saying where they charge you for every bit of extra service. 
4) Amenities - Not even a barf bag. (Makes sense since the seat in front of you has no pocket for it?)

I have always heard awful things about Ryan air from most people that fly with them so I've always avoided them but they was the only airline that was flying to my destination on the dates I needed. I can honestly say I will never ever ever fly with them again. The whole experience was stressful. What is a cheap flight turns out expensive when they then refuse to let you check in online and charge you to go so at the airport. Avoid this airline customer service is shocking and all they want to do is rob your money. Seats on the plane also so uncomfortable. Better to spend more money on the flights with another airline.

The afternoon of Wednesday, April 10/24, we experienced our worst day with Ryanair that was so easily preventable on Ryanair's part and would have COST Ryanair ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! Instead, it ended up costing us and 2 other passengers hundreds of pounds. As responsible, experienced travelers, my husband and I did EXACTLY, if not more, what we should do as passengers.  As it turned out, 2 other passengers did exactly the same as us, but we were all thwarted from boarding flight FR72 departing at 12:50 from London-Stansted for Carcassonne, France.
WE DID EVERYTHING, if not more (!!), that WE WERE SUPPOSED TO DO AS PASSENGERS!  We arrived at Stansted airport  not just 2 hours before departure, but arrived at the airport 3 hours before departure.  We arrived at Gate 40 not just 30 minutes before boarding, but 50 minutes before boarding.

I mention this because of the 2 responses I received from Ryanair Customer Services, insinuating we had done neither of the above and without addressing the issue of what we and others have experienced.  Ryanair responses attached below.  Please continue reading to see what we and others have unnecessarily experienced.

As soon as the gate number for our flight was posted an hour before departure, my husband & I briskly walked to & arrived 10 minutes later at Gate 40.  A previous flight's passengers were lined up at Gate 40 and being checked in, so we went to the nearby Gate 40 seating area that was on the other side of the pillar from Gate 40. Please see attached pictures below for clarity.

While waiting there, we clearly heard announcements for OTHER flights. We heard NO announcements for OUR flight.  Because of  the very large pillar blocking our view of Gate 40 as well as no announcements re: flight FR 72, we had no idea  that passengers were being boarded.  By the time we noticed Carcassonne-bound passengers on the ground waiting to board, it was too late in spite of the fact that we did EVERYTHING we were supposed to do! What Ryanair failed to do was to anticipate that if passengers sat in the Gate 40 seating area, there was a very good chance that some would miss their flights for the same reasons 4 experienced travellers did!  This and the resulting expenses incurred, let alone the major aggravation & dissatisfaction all could have been prevented by even 1 of 3 simple, courteous, anticipatory actions listed below, by Ryanair.  

HERE’S HOW: 

1- If just a simple sign had been put up on the pillar saying something to the effect of, “Attention! As there will be no boarding announcements from Gate 40, you will not see passengers lining up to board at Gate 40 if you sit here.  To assure a smooth, problem-free boarding experience, please wait in line at Gate 40.  Thank you.”  Miniscule cost to Ryanair to print 1 paper. 

2- Or make it real classy, put up a screen in the Gate 40 seating area, showing flights that are """"Now boarding”. 

3- Not into classy?  Then, do a simple call out warning to people sitting in the Gate 40 waiting area on the other side of the pillar where the lineup for Gate 40 is obscured!  

RESULT -  No aggravated passengers incurring unnecessary expenses and a 6 hour flight delay, resulting from Ryanair's lack of forethought for passengers at Gate 40, Stansted.  

What we experienced was simply no less than inexcusable, ridiculous and preventable with just 1 piece of paper and/or an additional TV screen showing boardings or call out warning by staff, this COULD HAVE BEEN SO EASILY PREVENTED BY Ryanair!  I would like to think that Ryanair will do the right thing, consider the customer usage viewpoint, then refund the monetary losses unfairly incurred by us as well as fellow passengers.  

BTW, why “pathetic"""" in my subject line? Three reasons:

1) Because on the Ryanair FB page, I read of a mother with a young baby who had the same experience as we did at Gate 40, but in her case, just before getting in line, she needed to change the baby’s diaper.  As quickly as she could, she returned to board and just as we could, she saw passengers, a stairway away, waiting to board on the tarmac, but she was denied access.  A mother WITH A BABY!!!!

2) Clearly, what happened to us has happened to others at gate 40.  If Ryanair chooses not to make announcements for some bizarre reason (saves money??), that can be clearly heard, chooses not to put up a piece of paper warning seated passengers that the gate 40 boarding lineup cannot be seen from the other side of the visual obstruction that is the pillar, nor go all out and put up a TV screen where people are seated,  what exactly is the problem with a reminder note for Ryanair employees at gate 40 to take no more than 10 steps along the windows to the other side of the pillar (please see photos 1-3 below) to quickly check that everyone knows that Ryanair is boarding and to proceed immediately to the other side of the pillar to board???!!!

3) Corporate greed!!! We were each charged £100 pounds to be booked on the next flight going to Toulouse. £100???!!!  I just checked what a flight from Stansted to Toulouse a week later on a Wednesday would cost - £20.49.  The next day it would have cost £16!  So we were charged about 5 times the price to fly 6 hours later to an airport we didn’t want to go to!!!  How is this anything else but incredibly greedy, billion dollar corporate  “nickle & diming” when customers are stressed and angry and then charged £100 pounds!!??!!  Of course, looking at it from a financial point of view, how easy is that to steal £100/pp, rather than DO THE ETHICAL thing and tell the customer, """"I see there are seats available to Toulouse in 6 hours.  If you book yourselves, you’ll pay a minimal amount, if I do it for you, it’ll cost £100.  What would you prefer?” Were we supposed to be grateful about this, because Ryanair is doing us some sort of £100/pp favour??!!

Ryanair NEEDS TO DO BETTER AND DO THE RIGHT THING!!! REIMBURSE OUR EXPENSES and apologize for not making even the smallest effort to prevent missed flights waiting to happen at Gate 40, Stansted!!!

Expenses:

-£100 x 2 = £200 to get us on Stansted FR 281-Toulouse flight 

-€110 our part for shared Uber to get 4 of us from Toulouse airport to Carcassonne airport where our cars were parked.  FR 281 arrived in Toulouse at  22:30, too late to get a train or bus to Carcassonne. 

€233.66 = £200  

€110  = £94.16

€343.66 or £294.16 total"

Secondly you had No milk no pop minimal Pringles no beer and more stuff was missing. Lastly they put the seat belt light on for at least 15 minutes so one of the pilots could come out and have a chin wag with the staff and watch videos on one of their phones while one of the crew staff went into the cockpit to do god knows what. I struggle with IBS and really needed the toilet so I just got up and so did 2 other people a few seats behind me I got told to sit down as I was heading to the front of the plane and they was heading to the back I said what about them 2 at the back of the plane that he didn’t see because he was to busy watching a video one the pilots phone. When the seat belt sign finally went off I headed back to the front of the plane toilet and the crew member that told me to sit down turned and said you can’t come to the front off the plane while the pilots out of the cockpit I said well you should be more considerate when looking after the passengers instead of having a laugh watching videos on your phone then he lied to my face and said the pilot needed the toilet I was watching them the whole time as I really needed the toilet.

Honest and polite persons are penalized by missing the flight and paying additional money to buy other tickets.
They do not care passengers’ emotions at all, as ground staff said “it is our business model” when we were very sad by missing flight due to their poor operations.
Bad for children’s education/discipline. 100% unacceptable.
Ryanair did not allow us to get us on board, because we were waiting in a long queue by following airline ground staff’s and security’s instructions. Several passengers came into the front of the queue at the counter and spent a long time by discussing or negotiating something with the ground staff, and we had to wait more in the queue. Very poor operations. After long waiting for airport security, we ran to the gate but gate was closed.
Many other passengers missed the flight and they were in a long queue to find a new flight. Many were crying and angry. I did not want to see such a situation during vacation.
It was Sunday flight, and they mentioned they can change to the new flight in the same country. We planned to fly to Basel in Switzerland, and they do not have any other flights to Switzerland, so they offered a next flight on Wednesday (3 days later) with additional 100 GBP payment per person.
I asked if we can fly to somewhere else in France (I knew their flight to Basel might be registered as ‘Swiss’ flight), but they ‘insulted’ me by saying “Do you know in which country Basel is?”. I answered the place itself is in France, then this ground staff side not answer anything (it seems the ground staff did not know the exact location of Basel airport).

Anyway long story short 10 hour delay which entitles you to a £3 voucher and then a £6 voucher - better than nothing but then again not every outlet will accept it - perhaps it isnt better than nothing in some outlets. Anyway we got there in the end. Our delay at least gave us time to apply to the delay comensation scheme. Now heres a thing, as part of the process they ask you for your IBAN and BIC numbers, you can find these on your banking app easily enought (I'm an oldie and I found it - eventually). Note though that its not your bank BIC that they want. Its the country BIC they want. You need to go to iban.com and enter your IBAN, it will then generate the BIC that you need. Please please let others know about this. On some sites you see people advising to use XXX at the end and that might be right but best to check on iban.com.

We like many others were asked to put the bag in the check stand only to find the had changed the stands. Previously the bagels were lowered into a type of cage. Now. The bags are slide in the front of the stand. At the stands base is some yellow tape and you bag has to fit in and not overhang the tape. Ours and the vast majority of the passengers that were asked to use the stands did fit behind the tape. Ryanair then proceed to charge everyone £70 to take the bag. Your  alternative was to leave the bag behind or be offloaded from the flight. Ryanair we’re making an absolute fortune. Fortunately for us we managed to get some belts out of our luggage and pull the case in the very small amount and board without paying.  What I found most astonishing is o. return flight. We all used the very same bags carrying the same contents without the belts on and were again asked to place them in the bag stand. They overhung the.

The flight I was supposed to board was due to leave on 1 May at 8 AM. To my dismay, at 7 AM that morning, while inside the boarding lounge, the boarding screen indicated that the new departure flight was estimated 3 PM, some 8 hours later. We are talking about a 1 hour and fifteen minutes flight. By the time 2 PM arrived I felt like I knew the airport so well I could write a book about it. 

When presenting myself at the boarding gate, the plane was still not ready to take off. Luckily enough (for me) there was another Ryanair flight due to leave at 15H05 that I could board and finally leave. The passengers on the flight initially booked at 8 AM rightfully charged the boarding of the other flight demanding that they should be boarded. Some argued that they were missing their connecting flights, others all their hotel bookings. The shouting, the threats and slammed doors made it that the flight was delayed by at least 1 hour and a half, so we finally left at around 5 PM. In the confusion and ensuing clamor,  the police  had to intervene as the whole scene and clamor attracted the attention of a good part of the airport’s passengers. 

I can’t imagine what the Ryanair staff had to go through with dozens of edgy flyers insulting them and occasionally forcing the entrance. This lasted for a good hour and a half. Ironically, I later got a message from Ryanair that they were working on the plane and that the new estimated time of departure was now 19H00, meaning a good 11 hours delay. To this day, I don’ know what became of that flight or of the passengers on it. 

Now, I know that no one expects the best from a low cost airlines. Tickets for a seat sell from 20 euros and sometimes less. Slight delays, frustrated stewardesses or limited knee space is part of the trade off. But this just adds a whole new dimension to it. Leaving your passengers stranded for more than 11 hours ( some with babies, some past a certain age), without no one to communicate with them during that time is really demeaning them. Unlike some of those passengers that chose to voice their dismay by calling them a s**t airline, I believe recounting exactly what happened will make flyers make better choices in the future."

Outbound we all were scattered as booking seats cost additional but the 17 year olds asked if they could sit next to someone they knew on return.  So on last day of the best holiday ever, lying by the pool I went on to my Ryanair app to check us in.  This is when the nightmare unknowingly began.  The app said """"check in unavailable please check in at airport"""" I tried many times throughout the day and same message.  I didn't take a screenshot which turns out to be a BIG mistake so please - anyone reading - screenshot EVERYTHING! I didn't think much of it, I haven't travelled since covid so I was used to checking in at airport.  
The next day our shuttle dropped us off at airport and we joined the check in line which had about 6 people in line.  Two staff working.  2.5 hours before flight.   However each customer had an issue and a few went to supervisor.  I stepped forward to check in and was greeted with """"that will be 55 euro each""""  I said oh no let me explain, the app wouldn't let me check in yesterday.  She said if its within two hours you pay 55 euro each.  I had my app open and I had 1 hour 58 minutes until flight.  I politely explained that I was in the queue in plenty time and to be resonable, 9 x 55 = 495 euro!!! I also asked for the booked wheelchair for my passenger to be arranged.  

Next up was supervisor - had to wait for her to finish being rude to a customer who had paid for flight and showed her bank app and email receipt but no no he had to pay again and sort it out post flight.  She made quick work of me - do you have pa screenshot then no, you all might be lying, rules are rules - pay it.  I asked her to also get wheelchair whilst I marched to customer service desk for Ryanair - saved the best for last!  This woman roller her eyes then answered the phone and sorted a query whilst we waited almost in tears.  She put the phone down and said its simple """"you want to go home today you pay the money.  If not you don't go home""""  
At this point I turned to look at my group wondering where I would get 500 euros from and my ill friend still had no wheelchair - so we then argued about that.  I got the wheelchair at least!!! 
Reluctantly paid to get us home and said well if I am paying can we seat the children next to one of us please.  """"one moment"""" then handed boarding passes and guess what - no one sat next to the kids.  

We had to run to the gate and got on the plane with seconds to spare.  I was sick in the bathroom with the stress of it all.  I must add the cabin crew were absolute angels and thought it was ridiculous and hoped I got my money back.  Lovely Scottish lads who checked on me a few times during the flight.  

Emailed Ryanair and its all my fault for not checking in online or two hours before flight according to them.  I explained it wasn't available online and I was there before two hours but the queue took an age to process 6 customers as most had issues.  Its gone back and forth and the result is the customer is at fault and I am not getting my 495 euros back - £427 which cost more than my share of the holiday!!!!

The worst experience I have ever had at an airport or indeed customer service full stop.  All 9 passengers have vowed to never use them again and work begins on telling everyone we know about the outrageous nerve they have to gleam your money.  

I asked to negotiate a payment as £427 to check in 9 people, took 10 minutes and they didn't book the seats together for the children (I was prepared to pay the charge at the airport for that) but no negotiation was offered so they have lost future custom.

I am disabled  and cannot stand for more than 5-10 minutes. So I tried to get a wheelchair, by the way I arrived 2 and a half hours before my flight. I tried to get a wheelchair and waited about 10 minutes, and then they told me I have to get my boarding pass, so I waited in another queue and then got told to go in another queue. Altogether this took around 45 minutes. Even though I paid for priority. Once I was checking in, I had to pay £220, £55 each person for a late check in fee. One of my bags was a little overweight but the guy said he’ll waive the  £9 per kilo. I still got charged. 
On my way back to the UK from Morocco was even worse. I wanted to see how much overweight my large suitcases were so I could some stuff out, so I put them on the thing that checks the weight and the weight wasn’t coming up but the guy put my bags through and said he didn’t understand me when I said I want to items out to lower the weight. I got charged £40 for this. I also got charged £50 for bringing 2 small suitcases, they didn’t ask me if it could as a cabin bag, even though I brought the bags from the UK and wasn’t charged for them. I paid £50 for these 2 bags. After all of this, I needed to get a wheelchair so I went to special assistance and despite not having one for checking in which took an hour, I waited another 25 minutes for them to find a wheelchair and bring it to me. These people were horrible and treated us as if we were nothing. There is no way on earth I’ll ever fly with Ryanair again, I don’t care how cheap their flights are.

I was travelling with my sisters and her three children, all under the age of 5 years.

On entry of the plane, I was struggling for room to place my black bag in the overhead cabin storage of the plane due to it being full of other flight attendants' luggage which was in my allocated cabin storage, so I temporarily placed it on my seat. The bag was a mesh see-through bag visibly full of children's snacks and food with special dietary requirements for the duration of our stay at Billund.
The bag had successfully gone through customs and is allowed on the plane. I have attached an image of what the bag looked like that contained the food.

My sister was on the flight located further back with her 3 children under 5. One of the children were distressed so I made my way towards her to help with her bags whilst she settled the child. After a few minutes I returned to my seat, I found it to be empty with no bag to be seen. 
I attempted to ask the stewards but was ignored, he ushered me to my seat and rushed off (the steward was a tall, slim build blonde male with a foreign accent). I asked around about my bag and the people behind said the stewards took it forward and put it up.
Then I asked a female air hostess (brunette young English female petite with glasses) about this and she said she's busy, she will get back to me.
For the full duration of the flight she was nowhere to be seen, so I got up and went to the back of the plane to enquire about my missing bag as I received no response from any of the stewards. 
Once again, I was rushed back to my seat by the same male steward at the start of the flight. After asking multiple times, he eventually told me that they had taken the bag off the flight.

No effort was made to identify whose bag it was. It was clear BEFORE take off it was my bag that had been removed. 
Instead of being honest the steward avoided and lied to me as he claimed that an announcement was made on the tannoy regarding the bag. 
This did not happen as neither myself or my 2 sisters heard it. When challenged the Captain denied an announcement being made, highlighting the dishonesty and lack of integrity of the steward.

We sought a solution to have our bag returned to us. It was not possible to have the bag returned to us in Billund. 
The Captain advised to report it as missing and upon arriving back in Manchester to go to Customer Service or Lost and Found and he guaranteed the bag will be delivered to one of them locations.
I told him I will be logging a formal complaint about how the situation was dealt with and would like a name if the matter was not resolved. 
He proceeded to say I am the Captain and should be able to recount the event if needed.

I followed the Captain's instructions and logged it as soon as I landed in Billund as lost property- when explaining the situation at the lost property desk at Billund the gentlemen who logged the report said that the situation is bizarre and has never occurred. """"Why would a bag of children snacks be removed?""""
We landed back in Manchester on Sunday 21/04/24, as advised I went straight to Lost and Found in Terminal 1 who said they received no such bag and told me to go to the Ryanair desk in Terminal 3 where the bag again was not located. 
It was at the Ryanair customer service desk I spoke to Taylor who was surprised that a bag visibly full of children snacks was removed. Taylor explained that should not happen as the bag has been through security. He seemed embarrassed and suggested that the stewards must have either been newly recruited or towards the end of their shift confirming my belief that the steward/stewardess who took the decision to remove the bag were lazy and were not concerned with the outcome of their decision.

After being sent back and forth around the airport wasting  an additional 2 hours to be told that the bag could not be located it is clear that it has been STOLEN BY STAFF. I asked Taylor if there was anything further I should do to obtain my bag. 
He advised contacting Ryanair customer service which I did and spoke to Ali. 
I reported the bag as missing and was told I will receive communication within 24 hours. 
4 days have passed and I am still waiting for a response. 

I am extremely angry that the laziness and poor decision making process of your staff impacted our holiday. 
The bag which was taken contained childrens' belongings and foods to meet specific dietary requirements. 
As a result, this caused the young children to be distressed. Furthermore everybody slept hungry on the first night as all local shops were closed due to arriving so late.

Sadly, the above summarises the theft of my bag and doesn't account for the rudeness I encountered with staff on the return journey. 
My allocated seat was 4C. The seat was occupied by what must have been a family. I confirmed with my boarding ticket that the passenger was indeed in the incorrect seat. I kindly began to explain to the person in my seat that if your a family I don't mind sitting in your seat. 
I was rudely interrupted by the steward and told to just sit there as he pointed at a couple of empty seats. To my surprise I later learned he was the supervisor. 
He lacked basic etiquette, furthermore holds no standards as he promotes people sitting wherever they like.
There seems to be a culture of poor manners and abrupt tone amongst colleagues as I was disgusted at what I later heard. My sister was carrying a sleeping child and ushering another 2 children and carrying a bag. Instead of offering assistance she was told to 'hurry up' whilst leaning against the side of the plane and rolling his eyes. 
I appreciate Ryanair is a budget airline but staff should have basic manners and follow procedures implemented by the airline.

Myself and my family have previously flown with Ryanair several times and it has been a pleasant journey.
This recurring dreadful experience has caused me to rethink my decision to fly with the airline.
Rude staff, zero accountability, poor customer service and thieving staff!!

The bag contained up to £70 worth of goods which I expect to be compensated as a minimum let alone up to the 2 hours of time wasted looking for my STOLEN bag."

I have contacted them four times about this now and got no further, one person told me they will escalate this query and I will be contacted in a few days which did not happen. Another told me to contact NCP which I have done and they say they cannot find my booking and I have to contact them again, I have even tried ringing 3 times and never been able to get through to an actual person and the robot kept putting the phone down on me. I have paid for a service which I will not be getting now as they have cancelled the flights and my flights have changed to earlier and therefore the parking time they have given me is void.

Not only I had to pay more for the Cabin Baggage because I was not able to log into the system to buy it online (because it was giving technical issues), but I also got charged extra before stepping into the plane for the cabin baggage. As they said it was too big, although it is standard cabin baggage. I have used that same suitcase as cabin baggage to fly all over Europe and also oversees. It is standard carry on size. No other airlines and even previous Ryainer flights I took didn't say anything about it. These Ryainer ladies in Stanstead airport for giving very bad customer service and they charged me 70 pounds extra for this suitcase. For the extra 35 pounds I already had paid for the suitcase. I feel this number 70 pounds were just so random, and they just charged me whatever they thought they want without any explanation. Eventually as I calculate it would have been cheaper for me to fly other airlines on same route, which I will do the next time for sure. This was my last time with them. The airplane cabin experience also was the worst. They had assigned the last row for me and it was all the time bad smell coming from the restroom.

Well - what a waste of money. Firstly they cancelled our outbound flight without any explanation but didn't cancel the return. They had no suitable alternative available so we ended up booking 1 way from Gatwick and having to get the coach as we would be flying back to Bournemouth. Considerable extra expense to try to stick to our original plans as best we could.
The return flight was ok but we fell foul of their """"so called"""" random seat allocation on checkin. At every stage the app and online tries to pursued you to pay for a seat. We didn't need to - it's less than a 2 hours flight! So when we checked in online - we were each """"randomly"""" allocated a middle block seat at opposite ends of the plane. Not very random I suspect. To add insult - when we boarded, the flight was less than 25% full so there was absolutely no reason why we shouldn't have been offered seats together. Fortunately the crew were great and basically told us to sit where we like. 
Finally, last time we flew with them they used to boast one of the most modern fleets of planes. Well the old lady that we flew on was absolutely knackered - tatty, visibly falling apart trim panels inside, and it sounded like it needed a damn good service.

There is frequently some form of drama on Ryanair in my experience, such as fist-fights in queues exacerbated by a lack of staff, stroppy staff, hungover cabin crew (and - worse - some barely communicative with pupils like dinner plates - clearly on more than alcohol). This time, the (Maltese, presumably another Ryanair tax blag) crew were lovely. What was not lovely, was being unable to check in online until <24 hours before the flight unless you took paid extras. No problem, we thought, we'll check in at the airport, especially as it's a quiet one in Germany where they are fond of a traditional process. The lady at checkin took our passports, scanned them, and only then demanded a €55 per head airport check in fee, which it was now too late to avoid! A fee which none of the plethora of """"get ready to fly"""" type emails mentioned. A modest fee would be acceptable, a fee beyond the original price of the tickets is a joke, especially as their """"no online checkin without buying a seat allocation"""" rule is pushing people this way. They know not everyone likes to use a digital QR code in case their phone dies (or they have children with them and are managing multiple checkins). They know its hard to print things when travelling, they are profiteering by levelling an excessive fee in a process specifically designed to bring this about. Which is an unethical, borderline fraudulent business model. As is endlessly reducing the size of the baggage allowed, how many times do they think we want to buy baggage? How is that """"budget"""" or good for the planet? Together with their tax shenanigans, stresssed mismanaged pilots (often contracted in by agencies avoiding tax), and general attitude, I will continue to fly with them only when there is zero alternative - I'll happily pay twice their rates to be treated like a human being, with no surprises later. The scale of their fees warrants legal investigation as it is wildly out of line with their cost of providing the service (in this case a lady already sat there, with zero queue before or after us). The keyboard warriors who say """"its in the small print, get over it"""" need to appreciate the lack of clarity in the communications, the deliberate design of process, and the lack of relationship between the fee and the cost incurred, none of which are acceptable."

As I went into the plane (entrance at the back) I kindly asked again to be sure, but the flight attendant directly told me in a very unfriendly manner that it’s not allowed. I insisted that it’s allowed (because I thought so and at all flights before it was never a problem) and they told me that I can change after takeoff.

Just to be very sure I even asked the Purser and she said it’s not allowed, but at least she told me that she will ask the captain. I don’t know if she asked him, because she didn’t come up to me if it’s possible or not. 

After TakeOff I changed my seat. Several other passengers also changed the seats, so I didn’t mind anything. I was sitting there, minding my own business for 2 hours. 

Then the purser and the attendant i asked first, came up to me and confronted my directly with a loud and strength voice, that I don’t follow the rules and started to argue. It started a heated conversation, first they said it couldn’t change weqtw because of balance (okay?), then they said it’s because the seats cost extra (what I doubt). I offered to pay extra or go back to my seat but they didn’t care and argued. It felt like they just wanted to argue.

Yesterday, 07.04.24 after purchasing priority tickets Ryanair FR3646 Edinburgh to Milan (Bergamo) and arrived at the boarding gate to discover that the flight was overbooked. The representative was extremely rude and I pointed this out to him as I was asking for clarification. (I had never heard of a flight being overbooked and not being able to board) I then asked him for his name and he took his badge out of his lanyard and turned it around and he demanded (and aggressively) that I hand him my passport back. I did and he started typing and advised that I was now at the bottom of the queue. He working with Kelli at Gate 26. She didn’t see him do this.
When all the passengers had boarded he shouted out my daughter's name and another passenger's name but when I advised him I was with her, he again stated that I was at the bottom of the queue. At this point we were advised that there were no seats available and we would have to get a morning flight. This was no good to us as we needed to be there that evening, as we had to leave early for Monaco by train on the Monday, which was booked and hotel was paid for.. 
There was also a Manchester flight but he stated there was no guarantee we would make the flight on time as we had to leave now and no arrangements at that time had been made. It was at this point we had to weigh up the probability of arriving and getting to Monaco and making our arrival time for the train and after considering our options we felt the chances were now unlikely, so decided to cancel our holiday which visibly upsetting for my daughter and myself. So, I am looking to be fully compensated for the full amount of my flight tickets, train tickets and hotel we booked for travelling.

His colleague asked him to board us and he said no and asked him not to get involved.

I arrived at the desk and the guy has already called his colleague. The colleague immediately got violent with me, screaming and trying to fight me. She removed her badge and thrown it and came at the other side of the desk where I was standing and was making violent and intimidating actions with her hands and asking to fight me. Her other colleagues tried to calm her before some of them started to be aggressive toward me. I could not believe my eyes. She got more aggravated when I took my phone out to record the incident. She phoned the police who came and took no action as they find out that she was the aggressor. I could not believe it, I was chocked and we were really scared.

We, who had paid quite a sum for hold luggage, were offered going to the oversized baggage desk, the queue was expectedly long and a total mess, as more and more people at risk to miss their flights were joining at the desk. When in the gate area, I found out that the flight is delayed for about two hours, later the delay was extended, and - an act of fantastic generosity - passengers were offered a 3 pound voucher (less than a price of a cup of coffee). When the gate was announced, everything became a mess again: in a hysterical rush we were herded like cattle to the gate and squeezed through it, not as a queue, rather as a crowd. Meanwhile a lady was picking a passenger here and there and pushed them through the crowd to the measurement boxes. I was made to place my small cabin bag into the box twice, although on the first time it was pretty clear that it fits. She applied such a pressure on me, that, while doing this, stressed and tired, I twisted my thumb really badly. Not only she never offered any help, but instead insisted on taking the bag out and placing it into the box again. This second time I was literally screaming of pain. When on board, they gave me some ice per my request, but said it ws all the ice they had. Instead there appeared a male attendant and tried to get my hand 'to check if the thumb moves, I am not a doctor, I only want to help' (very encouraging). I couldn't fasten the belts because of the injury, but no one cared anyway. We arrived almost three hours behind the schedule, and my twisted thumb will be healing for quite a time, I am still wearing a fixing band.

When this was decisively challenged by myself she escalated the situation further by accusing myself of being aggressive and swearing at her (neither were true and we had the rest of the party as witness too which she wasn't banking on) and threatening to block our whole party from boarding the flight.

7.20832347869873,2.23778128623962,"Ryanair Baggage Policy",1,"I was denied boarding from the Ryanair crew at the airport of Fuerteventura.
My flight included a hand luggage, a small luggage, and priority boarding. While queuing for boarding, three individuals at the gate checked the boarding cards: a blue-haired woman, a brown-haired woman, and a young man (all of whom refused to disclose their names after what happened).
The blue-haired woman asked me to measure my luggage, and everything was fine except for one centimeter over the width limit. 
At the beginning I complained saying that it was feasible to compress the luggage for that centimeter using a lace or zipper to meet the correct dimensions. In response, she insisted on charging me 70€, saying literally “you have to pay these 70€ for your bad attitude”.
Despite this “explanation”, I agreed to pay the extra fee. She then ordered me to wait to pay it until all other passengers boarded. The boarding process took a lot (I was waiting with my debit card in my hand for more than 40 minutes), but eventually it was only a family and me left to board.
As soon as the family was boarded, the blue-haired woman and her female colleague said something in Spanish to one another and they looked at me and said “the gate is closed, you cannot take this flight”. Without further explanations. 
At that point, I started being very anxious. I started to complain and they were not answering my questions, they just ordered me to stop talking and to stop complaining. They didn't let me take the flight I paid and left me at the gate alone without explanations. 
Later I tried to complain with the Ryanair office but it was closed, but I met one of the two woman again and I asked one more time the reason why they didn’t let me to take my flight and she said literally “we denied your boarding because of your bad attitude”.
Due to these two women unfair behavior, I needed to stay an extra night in a Fuerteventura Airbnb, arranging a taxi and finding an alternative flight that involved connecting transports in other countries to reach my final destination.

I must express my deep disappointment in Ryanair for not addressing this matter correctly and, most importantly, in an honest way even when I contacted them and explained the situation. I will never take a Ryanair flight again, no matter how cheap, the respect for the clients should be the top priority for a company.

This seemed unreasonable, considering we've traveled worldwide with this bag without issue. Despite our explanations, they remained adamant. When I requested their names to file a complaint, they refused, infringing on our rights. Feeling frustrated, I took a photo, which they objected to, citing privacy concerns, though I knew I was within my rights. The situation escalated, and I requested to speak to the manager, who arrived without introducing herself. After clarifying our priority status and payment for the bag, she suggested removing the wheels for a refund, which seemed absurd. Her explanation that they were a low-cost company further frustrated us. Despite our efforts to address the unprofessionalism and disrespect, we received little resolution.

6.86443948745728,2.27229309082031,"Airline Baggage Fees",1,"Hello,I must express my immense disappointment and shock from yesterday's flight and the behavior of your staff at the airport. I have never experienced anything like this before, despite being a regular flyer.I was flying from Barcelona to Vienna, flight number W42937. Upon boarding, the attendant instructed me to leave my luggage to be measured by a colleague. I complied and approached the colleague. 

Unfortunately, I have never had to measure my luggage before, as my suitcase is small and always fits under the seat. I have been flying for many years and have never had to pay for my luggage as priority luggage. Additionally, when flying to Barcelona, I took flight number W42937 with Wizz Air (which is also your airline) and did not pay for luggage. Similarly, I have flown with you before (you can find boarding passes from last year attached) and encountered no issues.Setting aside the luggage matter, the crux of the issue is the behavior of your employees. I did not understand the gentleman's instructions as I was confused and tired—I am in the early stages of pregnancy and feeling unwell. I was shocked and confused about where to place my suitcase, so I put it in the overhead compartment for larger luggage. Instead of articulating his instructions for me to understand, the gentleman simply shouted that I was putting it in the wrong slot. Unfortunately, my fiancé was waiting for me near the door, and another lady wearing glasses shouted at him to board the plane and ignored his attempts to explain that he was waiting for me. She just kept yelling for him to board! My suitcase was slightly wider because I couldn't compress it—it's a hard shell. The gentleman demanded payment, and without any objections, I went to the lady with glasses who literally screamed at me that I needed a physical card, not Apple Pay. However, I did not have enough funds on my physical card, and they escorted my fiancé onto the plane with shouting without listening to him, despite his attempts to explain that he doesn't speak English and was trying to be helpful. We are decent people. 

Under pressure from your employee, I had to transfer money between accounts next to her and log into internet banking from abroad, which is neither comfortable nor safe for me. By what right does someone demand a physical card? I can pay with my phone! She took the card without showing me how much money she put on it and handed it back to me.The entire flight was unpleasant due to this experience, and I couldn't even sleep that night. I understand that you are a low-cost airline, but your employees should at least have the basics of decent behavior and elementary respect for the customer. 

I have never, ever encountered such behavior before, and considering how frequently I fly, and my fiancé even more so, I will reconsider my future flights with your airlines. It's not about the 45€, but about this kind of behavior. What did I do wrong? Did I steal something? Did I argue with someone?"

As a result we were forced to pay the full price for our carryon to be checked as luggage for the full price of 100 Pounds in addition to the 50 pounds that we already paid for our carryon.

During the process of ordering a ticket, a window appears where you need to select the type of baggage that you want to prepay and include in the ticket (see the photo 1). Since there are 4 of us flying, we were offered the Family Plus fare, where there are LARGE and BRIGHT BLUE ticks opposite the luggage of 10kg and 20kg. Since additional fee is taken from each passenger, it is logicaly and  understandable, that every passenger gets what's ticked. 

BUT NO! NOT WITH Ryanair! 

I was deeply surprised, when I checked in for the flight and it turned out that we had only ONE 20kg baggage included for all of us! (+ each had 10kg baggage). If you look at the small gray text in the screen shot, it turns out that it says with small grey text """"1 per booking"""". How can this be interpreted?!? As I should have guessed, we are talking about 1 suitcase for 4 people, although each of them pays an additional fee?!?!? 

I am sure that Ryanair airline has deceived me and is misleading its customers by using such tactics and methods of selling services.

As you probably already guessed, instead of an additional 8 euros for a 20kg baggage space (at the time of ticket purchase), I had to pay additional 45x3=135 euros to get the 3 missing 20kg baggage spaces (see the photo 2).

I received a response to say that I was correctly charged the check-in fee as I didn’t check in 2 hours before the flight.

I should not be charged a fee for not being able to check-in, when the check-in desk colleague was also unable to check us in via the system due to an error.

This would mean I have to pay 55 gbp in addition - fair enough. I was advised to go to their 'help desk' to sort it out. I went to 'Help desk ' to explain : my flight departs in 30 min, I HAVE TO CATCH THE FLIGHT, but there seems to be a mishap, I thought I had checked in online- BUT CAN THEY LET THE GATE KNOW I AM HERE AND WILL BOARD.  Two young ladies at the 'Helpdesk' - one says 'our system says you're' not checked in. I am not comfortable charging you 55£ if you feel you are checked in. I said: But I need to be on the plane - whatever it takes?! She disappears upstairs - meantime I ask her colleague where she has gone to - ' she is going to see if it is worth you paying £55 ..' SO I INSIST: worth what...worth seeing if your colleagues at the gate can keep gate open ? Is she talking to them? .....""""yES'....8 min later that colleague comes down, says she checked their system and I am definitely not checked in. So I said : listen, I need to be on that plane.

1) customer service thru the on line chat. very helpful. i talked to 2 people about 4 months apart. 1st time was to make sure i paid for everything i needed so i had no issues at the airport. 2nd was to see what the cancelation policy was cause i was not flying on the MAX. was not a MAX when i originally booked the flight it got changed later. even though i did not like the answer given. they agent was still friendly and knowledgeable.

2)  cabin flight crew. Very nice and professional. everyone of them had a smile on their faces the whole trip. never heard a negative word come out of their mouths when they where in the galley talking amongst themselves.

3) airport check-in staff. very helpful. less than 5 min from the time we got to the agent until we where heading to the gate. I had golf clubs and the agent had another staff member escort me (and anyone else who had larger bags) to where i was to drop of my clubs to make sure i was in the correct area.

4) flight deck crew. outstanding. as a nervous flier i hate turbulence. the flight deck made good announcements and informative about how much turbulence to expect and when. also the landing was like butter so smooth. i was expecting a a back breaker but not this time.

My wife and i really enjoyed our 3 hrs with Ryanair. they did not live up to their awful reputation at all, and that us a good thing. i think if the price is right and the aircraft was not a MAX i think i would fly with them again. I would make darn sure to bring my own seat cushion. LOL"

I feel compelled to share my recent experience with Ryanair to alert fellow passengers about the challenges they might face. Please consider this a word of caution before booking with this airline.

On December 2nd, 2023, I was scheduled to fly from Oslo Torp to London Stansted on Ryanair flight RK33. However, what followed was an unexpected and frustrating 5-hour delay. Throughout this ordeal, communication from Ryanair was virtually nonexistent. Passengers were left stranded, confused, and desperately seeking information.

Despite my repeated attempts to seek compensation in accordance with EU Regulation (EC) No 261/2004, which clearly outlines passenger rights in such scenarios, Ryanair was dismissive of my concerns. Their responses were generic, devoid of empathy, and offered no meaningful resolution.

It's worth noting that Ryanair also insisted on compensating passengers for food and drinks purchased during the delay. However, it's important to highlight that the options available at the airport were severely limited. Hot food or drinks were simply not accessible, leaving passengers with no viable alternatives other than a vending machine.

I share this experience not out of spite but as a plea for better treatment of passengers by airlines like Ryanair. As travelers, we deserve transparency, accountability, and respect. I encourage you to weigh your options carefully before booking with Ryanair and to share your own experiences to help others make informed decisions.

Let's advocate for better service standards together.

We thought it’d be better to spend more money in the destination and less on the flight so we chose this airline, worst decision.
On their website they say they accept 2 types of documents, passport or ID with a photo. 
I had my German Residence permit, with photo on it, just renewed a few days ago, so I didn’t take my passport. We spent hours to get to their airport, got a 20€ extra bus ticket to get there from Frankfurt, passed the security as one of the first people there, and waited for them to come and open the gate. They say you should check in 2 hours before the flight, we had it done a day before. The airplane arrived the airport later than what was told, so the gate wasn’t even opened for a long time and they came to open it later. When we got to the front of the line, they told me they can’t let me in because I don’t have my passport with me, although I showed them and they checked my Residence permit. They called for minutes with someone holding my card and came back and again said that they can’t let me in. Pay attention that our destination was Spain, a Schengen country and my card is the residence permit of Germany, another Schengen country, I wouldn’t even needed a visa to need a passport.
As I went to find their supervisor in the airport they had already boarded all the passengers. I talked to the police there but it was too late for them to help, as they had already closed the gate. So my girlfriend went alone, I had to buy another bus ticket for 20€ to get to Frankfurt main airport, talked to other airlines and the police at Frankfurt main airport and all of them said you didn’t need a passport when you have your card. So I had to buy a 330€ ticket one way ticket, which takes me almost 24 hours longer because this was my only option and has a long transfer time in Madrid. But got to Spain with my card and without needing a passport. Now it is almost 17 hours later than the flight I had booked with Ryanair and I am waiting at Madrid for my next flight in the morning. I have lost so much money, bus tickets, the initial and now second flight, a lot of energy, almost 2 days (if not all) of my 4 night vaccination is ruined,
And I tried to make a conversation via email with their support team and they just keep saying “if you have failed to check in 2 hours before the flight it’s not our problem and you can’t have a refund and we have closed your inquiry” which as I said we had done a day before it and is not the case at all, they are just trying to put it on me, using something that did not happen and I have even sent them all the documents and proof.
I do not only write this to raise awareness about this airline but also to ask for help, it would be great if someone can introduce a lawyer to check this.

In my case, it took several hours to complete verification as the login details given to me by lastminute.com would not work. Staff at both companies were unhelpful, each blaming the other for the problem. Eventually a lastminute.com member of staff gave me new logon details to resolve the issue.

After I was forced to pay penalties amounting to around 200 euros for three passengers, I raised a query to the airline who failed to respond to my specific queries on the following points:

- Why the airline required me to do the check-in twice;
- Why does your airline expect the customers to check emails regularly during holidays - you sent such notice only a day before the departure; and
- Why does your airline require such an arduous process while Wyzz Air does not require so? 

More precisely, on 6 November, I received a message from kiwi.com (my ticket agent) saying that all passenger details need to be filled in through their online platform in order to 'complete check in or send the boarding passes.' I could not do so for obscure passport images probably so I was requested to do so directly with Ryanair through their portal website: Check-in (Ryanair.com). You can see a copy of such a message from kiwi.com as attached. 

According to their instructions, I created an account with Ryanair directly on 6 November and submitted the required copies of all our passports and entered all passenger details on your website as required as part of the check-in process, after paying the required amount to your firm (please see the receipt from PayPal). 

I did complete the required check-in on 6 November, even by paying the fees to Ryanair.

The firm did not listen or bother checking if there was the first check-in. They charged me a penalty of failing to check in prior to the boarding on 27 December.

10.1496057510376,-1.11462366580963,"Ryanair Flight Delays",1,"We were due to fly from Dublin airport, DUB, on 21st January 2024 to Birmingham airport, BHX. Flight number FR664 scheduled departure time of 14:10.
On the day of the flight weather conditions were stormy, we were aware that they could be some possible delays but remained hopeful upon arrival at the airport as the information board did not state a delay on our flight. A smooth check in of our hold luggage and quick trip through security kept us positive. The information board stated to go to gate at the anticipated boarding time, however we waited, and nothing happened. We then found that the flight was delayed by two hours. So, we continued to wait, again we were then informed on the info board to go to gate, same thing happened, gate number then changed, no sign of boarding at that gate either. We continued to wait passed the flight departure time with no information other than the board stating to go to gate, this continued until approximately 20:00, 6 hours after our expected departure time, after which we were informed by email and from the info board that the flight would now depart at 21:50. We find the customer information desk for Ryan Air and the queue is huge, assuming as per the company motto “More Choice. Lower Fares. Great Care.” We would be well looked after should our flight be cancelled or have a long delay. Continuing to wait hopeful that the flight would depart at this time since some later flights had already left Dublin on course to Birmingham. A voucher was issued to each of us at this point for some snacks and refreshments ‘to keep us going’ the €5 was very handy considering a dried-up hot dog from one of the eateries was marked at an extortionate €16. We ended up with a twix and an orange juice, great nutrients to fuel us during the nearly 8 hours anticipated delay. 
Again, we go to gate, same thing again no sign of a flight ready to board. We continue to wait with no information. 21:00 flights are called over the tannoid to inform that they are cancelled and checked in luggage would be ready to collect from the baggage reclaim. Our flight wasn’t called so we continued to wait remaining hopeful that it would depart that night. We check the info board as a large number of flights had been called but not our own, this states a new departure time of 13:25 the following day! No email is received this time confirming this is the case, no support from Ryan Air as to how we should now spend the night whilst we wait for our over 23 hour proposed delayed flight. We continue to wait in hope of an email confirming we could collect our luggage and a hotel had been booked for us to get some sleep and as an apology for the delay – nothing. It gets to 00:30 both tiered, cold and hungry, we consider getting a hotel but are concerned as we have received no information on the whereabouts of our luggage, worried that if we leave the airport the flight will get cancelled and we will struggle to get our luggage back the next day.
Knowing that our fate was now to spend a night in a cold airport with nowhere to sleep nor having any basic amenities on us since who would need these for a 40-minute flight? We began to call around hotels close to the airport so that we could at least get some sleep, all fully booked so we remain in the airport. Questioning our sanity and feeling stripped of basic human rights, we get an hour maybe two of sleep before we wake up shivering, having to visit the duty free to purchase a hoodie for some extra warmth. Another €5 voucher received. Counting down the hours it finally reaches our boarding time and we see go to gate. Would you believe it… the same thing happens as the previous day, no sign of a plane to board and the gate number keeps changing. This time we decide to wait in the queue at the customer information desk worried that we may not even make it home that day after all. At the desk we are assured the flight will be going ahead and the luggage we had checked in over a day ago would make it home with us. We told the customer service assistant that we had waited all night in the airport with no hotel provided nor any information, no apology and they didn’t seem to care. Finally on 22nd January 2024 at 15:10 our flight departs, 2 hours sleep and a day of work and pay missed later.
Some things to consider, the weather is out of anyone’s control and cannot be helped, what is in control, is how a business treats its customers in these situations. Everyone knew the flight would not be going on time as a result of the storm and with many flights being cancelled. However, some later flights still departed, although still delayed, surely it would be in Ryan Air’s interest to have the customers who have been waiting the longest leave the airport? When the flight was delayed to the following day communication should’ve been made with the customers on their options. Would it not be reasonable to provide customers with a hotel for the night or is sleeping on the floor of an airport deemed suitable? Considering airport prices, is a €5 voucher a suitable sum to ensure customers can purchase food and drink as a result of the delay?
The review would’ve been much different had Ryan Air done the following:
•	Kept in communication via email with its customers on the delayed times
•	Knowing there would be an over night delay ensure that accommodation is provided to customers and a chance to collect checked in luggage 
•	Provided a suitable monitory sum to allow customers to purchase meals free of charge (a 25 hour delay should provide 3 meals per customer)
•	Ensured customers whom have waited the longest are put on the next flight to their destination rather than allowing later flights to depart with only a few hours delay

We send this complaint off to customer services... to my astonishment the feedback received said the following:
""""Dear Customer,
Thank you for your request.
All our pre-flight communications clearly reiterate the requirement for you to be at the airport at least 2 hours prior to the scheduled departure time.
To ensure that we board and depart on time, check-in desks close 40 minutes before the scheduled departure time and all passengers should be at the boarding gate at least 30 minutes before. Ryanair cannot be liable for any delays you may experience going through security at the airport.
In this instance, you are not entitled to a refund as you did not arrive for your flight on time.
Thank you for choosing to fly with Ryanair and we look forward to welcoming you on another flight in the future.
Kind Regards

I've never flown with Ryan air before and will never book with them again.

Ryanair was like $360 US (thru the 3rd party), and to re -book so late with another airline was 900.  Yikes. So I’m out $600 right before my trip bc of the cancellation, no alternative flights per Ryanair, so that sucks. Suck is the key word for this entire thing. Things happen, I think they said the issue was, it was some technical term, meaning lack of passengers perhaps cover the expense of the flight or something.  I’m not gunna look it up now.  So I bit the bullet and just expected my full refund from Ryanair for the cancelled flight in a reasonable time.  Meanwhile, I proceeded with my trip with other airlines…

The refund process is a mess, man. I’ve held my tongue on this page until today bc I didn’t want them to give “them” any reason to put my request at the bottom of the pile.  Today I see it hit my bank account, 4-5 months after the cancellation.  BIC NUMBERS AND IBAN NUMBERS, one of those doesn’t exist for US BANKS.  I think it’s IBAN.  Bc neither of my banks, or any in the US, have IBAN numbers in order for Ryan air to wire the refunds, I felt stuck.  So I told Ryan air this , So more forms , more proof of who I am, the flight booking, my bank, personal info etc.  I initially connected with them via the Ryan air app messenger, which started a ticket and email thread, I sent maybe 24 follow up emails “checking status, do you need anything else? I provided xyz like you asked” and there were always more forms and redundancy, but I followed up every week, and every other week until I got my return…today. I followed their requests, had to do my own research, etc, you’ve probably done it too smh.

Just damn, to sum it up.  I just expect airlines to send me my entitled refund within, I dunno, 10-14 biz days max?  This was nuts. Glad it’s over.  The talk of court in the chat is nuts too like come on Ryan air. NEVER AGAIN!!!"

Supremely UNETHICAL Airline....consistently!
My first experience flying Ryanair (July 2022) Ryan Air extorted sevreral hundred dollars from my son and I for 'failing to check in in advance"""" ignoring the fact that the Ryanair website was DOWN amd we were unable to complete the check in as a direct result.
2 weeks ago we flew from Marrakesh to Dublin on Ryan Air. The night before the flight I gave away clothes, art, toys and travel artifacts to avoid Ryan Air baggage fraud. We flew Ryan Air TO Morocco with no problems, but I am acutely aware of Ryanair's propoensity towards fraud, harassment and misconduct. AND Ryanair delivered. We arrived at the airport shortly after 2 am for a 545 am flight because of pervious experiences and observations. The agent refused to issue us our boarding passes because he determined that one of our carry on suitcases (for which we prepaid) didn't fit in the luggage measuring bin....when it did. I went back 4 times to show him directly and with photographs...and each time hbe insisted I pay him an additional $75 for the bag that arrived on a Ryan Air flight with the same measurement bins with absolutely NO problem.
He pointed in an arbitrary direction and directed me to pay the fine. There was no signage or clarity about what he expected me to do...and it took an additionlaal 45 minutes to pay the fine and navigate the extraordinarly slow check in line for the 4th time.
Even though we arrived at the airport several hours in advance, we had to race to the gate and almost missed our flight.
Ryan Air is consistently unethical, and extorts money out of compliant passangers by refusing to allow them to board the flight.
I've only flown Ryan Air a few times, but 100% of the time, I observe other passangers being abused, extorted and harassed. The following day in Dublin, we saw street performers with a sign reading: Checked a bag on Ryanair...Forced to Busk. :-)
I fly dozens of airlines relatively frequently...and have never experienced a more fraudulent and unethical airline than Ryan Air. Buyer BEWARE!
read other Ryan Air reviews before purchasing a flight with them.   The original fair is a microcosm of the cost of flying Ryan Air

PS Flying on Ryan Air is truly a cultural experience....My son calls it the 'Greyhound of the skies."""" The passangers do not sit in their assigned seats, they wander all over the plane throughout the flight and none wear masks. The woman behind me coughed over 150 times and kept wiping her nose with her hand. It's truly like riding a greyhound bus in the US....an experience on its own! (Do not recommend)"

We were told that all they were doing was taking names for hotel accommodation and they knew nothing about a flight. Later people were told there might be a flight the next morning at 8.45 am. We were then told to wait in the concourse area and a bus would come to take us to the accommodation. We waited for three hours. Many of the others drifted away, having organised their own accommodation and transport, but we were told that Ryanair might not cover those expenses, so we stayed. Finally, at around 11.20 pm, a senior airport person came and told everyone waiting that the Holiday Inn had 60 rooms booked, with no names attached (even though we had given our details and room requirements), and that no bus was coming and we should make our own arrangements for transport. You can imagine how tired the children were by this time. We went outside and after waiting about 15 minutes, got two taxis to take us to the Holiday Inn, arriving there at midnight.  The three children and their mother all had to sleep in a double bed as the hotel had no rooms with triple beds. It was a short night before we had to get up again at 6 to get taxis back to the airport for the 8.45am flight - try organising three children to wake and dress when they are exhausted, and you are as well! Ryanair was up to its old tricks again - calling the gate as closing at 8.15, checking us all through into a holding pen with no food or toilets, and then leaving us there until 9.30, when the aircraft we were to fly in had not left its home airport yet. It eventually took off at 10am.
I understand completely that a storm disrupts flights and Ryanair had no control over that. I appreciated the Bordeaux airport staff trying to help us (probably on over-time or extra shifts as the diverted flights were unplanned). I also know that other passengers on other diverted flights had a much worse time, spending five hours in the aircraft on the ground, for example, or having to sleep in the airport, or fly back to land in Dublin in the early hours of the morning. But what I  cannot excuse is Ryanair's total lack of communication to all its passengers. They have our emails in a group list, which they used to tell us about check-in, boarding, etc. It would have ben simple to tell us when the re-scheduled flight was arranged and its time. To tell us that accommodation was arranged, and the name of the hotel. To tell us there was no bus and to arrange our own transport. But they did none of that, leaving us to find out in dribs and drabs from hearsay from other passengers, what was maybe going to happen.  
Then on Monday, when we had arrived back, Ryanair sent an email saying they were sorry our flight was delayed and that our feedback was important to them. """"Take our survey and be in with a chance to win a €100 Ryanair Gift Card. """" There was a """"Take the survey"""" link to be clicked and, guess what? It didn't work. Of course they don't want any of us giving negative feedback. I requested another link and it was sent on Tuesday lunch-time and it again didn't work.
Now for the next step: will they actually refund the transport and food costs that we incurred?"

However, the lack of information, the obvious obsfucation, the lack of common human decency such as giving out water, the obvious sheer determiation for Ryanair to get that plane back in Budapest by hook or by crook was palpable.

When we started asking questions, she became very agitated and threw our passports onto the counter, saying that either we paid now or we were not flying. Because it was already late and we didn't want to spend a night at the airport, we paid and left. Later, I found out that $30+ is a fee for checking in at the airport and not online beforehand.

The gate display indicated closure close to 6 AM, and following this indication, we promptly made our way to the gate. The flight departure: 06:30.

Upon arrival, we witnessed other passengers successfully boarding the plane ahead of us. However, to our utter disbelief, we were abruptly informed that we were considered late and consequently could not be checked in. Notably, this happened while fellow passengers were still being allowed to board. Despite our efforts to reason with the boarding attendants for approximately 10 minutes and present evidence of the gate status and ongoing boarding activities, we were regrettably denied entry onto the plane. 

This unjust and arbitrary refusal to allow us to board, particularly after witnessing passengers being on boarded in front of us, was profoundly distressing and unacceptable.

Subsequently, seeking assistance from your customer service representatives near the gate, we were informed that there were no available flights for the day. However, following a subsequent inquiry with another Ryanair customer service point outside the gate area, we were offered tickets for the same day at an additional cost of £100 per person, despite having already paid the same amount for our initial tickets. This discrepancy in information and the subsequent additional charges were highly distressing and completely unacceptable.

In the circumstance where the Ryanair customer service team adjacent to the onboarding gate affirms no availability of tickets for subsequent flights on the day when requested for information, while the customer service at the terminal confirms the existence of over three available flights on the same day, this incongruity in provided information appears to be a manipulation of individuals' emotions and is profoundly disconcerting.

Passenger Name - Niroj Adhikari
Flying date - 10 January 2023
Flight number - FR4207

We did our online check in and went to the counter to get my boarding pass. Firstly Caruana Mariana she didn’t know If we can fly to London as we were holding passport of Nepal and Myanmar. She had to call someone and then I informed her that we are residents here in Malta and going to Stansted for a visit and we do have a visa of UK in our passport. And then she told me to put my bag to measure the length which I did and she told me the bag is large and I had to pay for it. Please find below attached picture of my bag while I was measuring. Yes I had to take out my jacket to make it smaller. 

I find Mariana Caruana very unprofessional and arrogant. She was looking down on me the whole time when I was requesting her in a very humble manner. I informed her that I flew to Romania on 3rd January 2024 with the same bag not only Romania I flew twice to Rome and then Belgium, Madrid and Greece I never ever had an issue with my bag but she strictly didn’t allow and ask me to pay. I asked her if she can’t help, she can call me her supervisor but she introduced me herself as a supervisor saying that she is the only person that I can talk. I told her that I will find someone else to talk and come to her but she denied me to leave the desk and demand me to stay with her. I inform her that I will find other people if she can’t help me or I change my bag or find some solution.After requesting her frequently she agreed to bring me her superior her name was Rebecca and I inform her also the same.I  was requested to put my bag for the measure which I did and it fit on the measure. But then both of them talk in Maltese which I don’t understand. I don’t think that it is appropriate for them to speak their language at my presence. After that both they started telling me that they can’t allow me to travel with that bag.

As I am informing you again I flew more than 7 times with Air Malta and Ryan from Luqa airport and I never had this kind of situation before not at the desk, not while boarding nor any of the crew member asked.

Eventually after all that chaos they made at the counter,  they let me go with my bag. I find this situation very abnormal and you must train your staff a basic manner not to speak in different language at front of client, be polite and call the superior when asked.

We arrived 30 minutes before departure, we received the luggage that we had to check in again for the next trip and we were denied boarding. The agent at the check in desk was rude, she said to us that it is not Ryanair's fault and Ryanair does not sell flights with connections, only point to point flights. She mentioned that we had to liaise with kiwi.com directly as we booked the flight with them. She gave us the option to board and take the luggage with us, meaning that we would have to pay 70 euros for the luggage and remove all liquids (the cost of all medications and liquids was over 150 euros). The second option given was for myself and my partner to fly and leave our luggage in Nuremberg and we would have to find a way to receive our luggage in Stansted. We asked for another flight, she said there was an evening flight and prompted us to the ticket office. The lady at the ticket office informed us that the evening flight had sold out and the next available flight was from Berlin on 3.1.2024. We said we needed an earlier flight; she was not helpful at all. She also informed us that we would have to book within the next 15 minutes before the plane departed as we would lose the whole booking entirely, If we would book another flight within the next 15 minutes we would only pay for the change of date.

When we returned to Stansted, I claimed via kiwi.com, I included all information and receipts, screenshots etc and within 1 day I received the message that the airline has refused to reimburse me. This is unacceptable from both parties; we have expenses of up to £600 due to the initial delay that caused us to miss the connecting flight and none of the parties take responsibility or have agreed to reimburse something.

According to UK and EU law, missing a connecting flight is a nightmare setback on a long journey. But UK travellers as well as anyone travelling to or from Europe might be legally protected when a flight connection goes wrong. 
According to UK and EU law, if you miss a connecting flight due to flight delay, cancellation, or being denied boarding you could be entitled to up to £520 compensation.
That’s because of an EU regulation EC 261 and its equivalent in UK law. Although there is no specific category of missed connection compensation, if the airline has caused you to miss your connecting flight due to flight delay, cancellation, or denied boarding, you can still make a claim for compensation.

They admitted that they have the system error, but still they didn't do anything about it!
This was my story:
i booked a flight in the ryan air app directly, and we have a bit of adjustment right after,.. there is no booking fee for changing flight within 24 hrs, so i did it, first i did the one for my friend. and when i have to change mine i have to verify my self (which is you just do when you booked the flight in a 3rd party).
so i did verify myself (there's two option. one is the express verification where you have to pay, like most , i dont want to pay so i just chose the free one) i didnt know that it will be verified in more than 24 hrs, so in short, when i rebook my flight i will have to pay 45euros more.
I called them within this 24 hrs frame and told them i want to rebook it, they told me i just have to wait, and maybe even the 24hr frame is done, I can still dodge the fee payment because i informed them.
but the next day, i can rebook my flight details again, but they said they cannot do anything about it anymore and i have to pay the extra 45 euro booking fee, and they said its my fault for not taking the faster/express verification.

I ask them about this problem about the verification, why should i do it if i didnt even booked in a third party???

On way back, late boarding then had to wait just outside the terminal for 20 minutes whilst aircraft cleaned, in the cold !. All going well until we were approaching Leeds when after a couple of failed attempts by the pilot to land we were diverted to Birmingham due to the heavy fog ! all passengers were in uproar. The cabin crew could not give any information as to what was going to happen when we got there and just said you will have to ask at  reception in the terminal !. Found out later that other aircraft had landed at Leeds minutes after we diverted and apparently it was due to our pilot being relatively new, which made everyone even angrier. Waited over an hour in the terminal ( no Ryanair rep in site) then all received a message saying buses would arrive to take passengers to Leeds in another hour and a half...everyone even more angry. We were advised that if we wished to make our own way to Leeds that would pay any 'reasonable' costs (whatever that meant ) but i suspect that would take a long time and be disputed/reduced in any case. when the buses eventually turned up they were small and the size of the seats were for kids and not suitable of comfy at all. Driver was rude and unhelpful, had to be begged to stop for a toilet break and then stopped off at some small service station with the toilets being a long way away in the dark and having to cross a busy road. Approaching Leeds (peak traffic at both Birmingham and Leeds) the driver was on a mission and driving fast and taking corners at pace scaring some people on the bus. I had some items in the overhead locker and whilst the driver was doing his Nigel Mansell impression on the roads they all fell out and my duty free smashed on the floor !.  We arrived about 7 hours late at Leeds tired and hungry, as never any offer of refreshments at any point made.  The next day i was trying to contact Ryanair to make a complaint which proved difficult to say the least. I received 2 bizzare replies to emails from Ryanair which were obviously 'set' replies and were absolutely nothing to do with the journey or even the correct flight. Apparently we were late for boarding and could'nt get a refund ??. I advised them twice they had mixed us up with someone else and can they please look into it, they then stated they had replied and were no longer continuing with this complaint !. I emailed again advising them that they were mistaken, giving the full details again and asked them to sort them selves out as they were a joke and it was a complete farce. I eventually received an email a couple of days later saying they had looked into this (eventually the correct bloody details this time) and we were not due any compensation or refund as the plane landed in within the 3 hours, i was fuming and said so. Whilst it landed...... it was at the wrong airport !!, no difference made. Very very unhelpful staff, system and attitude. Will never fly with Ryanair again, absolutely appalling attitude, could'nt seem to care less.

7.79001808166504,0.532908618450165,"Ryanair Flight Delays",1,"I had an exciting morning today flying with Ryanair from Bristol to Riga. Everything started with the back size checks. That was a fair thing to do and people should follow the rules. However, it ended up with few people queuing to pay extra for their bags as they could not quite fit their bags into a luggage frame. The stuff had to let the people go without payment as there was a risk for the flight to delay.  Great, we had still a chance to board on time. We got on the plane, all looked normal until the plane started to move or rather made an attempt. All electricity went off and it felt like the plane was continuing to move for couple of minutes without a control before it had finally stopped. It took a while for the pilots to figure out that something serious was going on and to call for engineers. The engineers had finally arrived and it didn't take long for them to check the plane and say that we were safe to flight. Great news!? Not quite. 15 minutes later the pilots failed again to start the plane. How was it possible that engineers were confident that plane is fixed and safe to go, when it was not?! Very concerning. It took another half an hour for checks. People were starting to get nervous and ,at least, we allowed to go the toilet that has resulted in a big queue. I was on my 12 week of pregnancy, toilet is a bit an issue at this stage but we could only acces toilets at the back of the plane and the que took the whole plane passage. So there was no chance to get to toilet from the middle of the plane. I was just hoping that we can get another plane as I had little trust now to the engineers. Finally, the pilot announced that engineers failed to fix the plane. We were back to the airport terminal and late by 1.5 hours at that point. According to the EU legislation passengers are allowed to claim for a compensation if a plane is delayed by more than 3 hours. Our flight was supposed to take off 06:05. The new time for the departure was 8:50. 15 minutes less to claim a refund 😂. I didn't mind waiting and was greatful that they have swapped the planes.  We had finally boarded another plane, however seats had a different numbering and people who booked an extra leg space ended up seating in a standard space. I have booked a space with an extra room as I am a tall person and  struggle with a claustrophobia in crowded and squeezed  spaces especially now when I am in my 1st trimester of pregnancy. Pregnant woman are allowed to seat by the emergency exit as long as their are abled and at early stage. I have asked stuff kindly if I can take a seat as per my booking with the extra leg space. Lady said that she can swap the rows as soon as all passengers have taken their places. And she did it but only for the opposite site of the plane fully ignoring my previous request.  I had to ask nicely again if she can swap seats and  the same lady has called for senior stuff. The very annoyed senior stuff told me that this can't be done, we were running too late. It would literally take 3 minutes! I have explained my reasons for the request as I might struggle in narrower row and there are reasons why I have paid extra. By that time I was distressed and in tears. I managed to get myself together as otherwise it would worthen the claustrophobia and I needed to keep myself safe. Is not it a priority to keep people calm to have a safe flight? 
To be fare, the junior stuff kindly asked if people seating in spaces with extra leg room (who have not paid to seat their) are willing to swap. It was humiliating as I was simply asking for something I have paid. I am still not sure if an answer of these passengers was 'No' or 'I don't know'? As it came out these people seating by the emergency were speaking only Lithuanian. And they were seating by the emergency exit! How on earth they are planning to assist opening the emergency exit and evacuation when stuff doesn't speak Lithuanian and passengers don't speak English?  Have they understood the guidelines explained in English? Is that actually safe?
The landing was at 1:40pm, so actually 2h40m late, no compensation. I was late on my bus to travel from Riga to Tallinn, 4,5 hours ride. It was a busy time of the year and all other busses with the same bus company were fully booked. I still managed to get home late evening and enjoy a bit of Christmas with my family."

Anyway another twenty minutes went by and still stood there no announcement  from the gate staff just stood there looking at us all and more content with going down the queue of people who had not paid for a extra cabin bag and charging them 50eur for the pleasure of taking the bag on the plane as their small cabin bag  was too big.

There was no apology for the delay from the flight crew and in fact  they said very little all flight the service average at best and the flight in general was poor and seat comfort  was also poor.
For me Ryanair are not interested at all in any form of customer service or  their customers  and are just programmed to get as much money off you at any cost and could not care less about you or any issues you may have.
To sum up i would not recommend flying Ryanair and would rather pay £50 more and fly with another airline and would only use them as a very very last resort which i did this time because of the flight time as the easyjet flight was too early."

You pay a low price for the ticket, then they charge you three times of the ticket's price for your literally cabin sized baggage or allegedly late check-in or whatever it goes (there are numerous examples in the reviews, wish we read them before). So they reach a nice profit at every flight. They probably earn more than any other airlines with this scam. Otherwise, it is a miracle they are still in operation. They charged £75 for the cabin baggage from Edinburgh to London, which they let on board from London to Edinburgh with no charge. It is the same bag! It is the same size!

7.0103554725647,0.473539978265762,"Ryanair Staff Behavior",1,"I had a terrible experience with Ryanair's boarding staff. Half way through boarding a flight from Liverpool to Poznan, the staff simply stopped boarding people and ignored the queue of people and busied themselves looking at Social Media on their phones, and chatting between themselves. This was particularly jarring as they did not take the time to say there was a delay, or to explain or apoloagise.

My partner was at the front of the queue and after around ten minutes one of them looked up and began yelling at him that he was too close to the gate. He couldn't move backwards due to the queue behind him, and when he began to respond the the team member, she turned away and walked off.

Her colleague had been watching this and giggling the whole time. My partner asked for the name of the person who had yelled at him so that he could raise a complaint, and she immediately became defensive and confrontational, before reluctantly giving her colleagues's name.

At this point and another couple politely intervened and told the lady that they had seen what happened and that her colleague had been quite rude. They were very and polite, but the team member immediately began yelling at them to keep out of it and that she would not allow them to fly. She demanded their names, but was very reluctant to give hers, clearly realising that they might complain about the way she was behaving.

She then immediately went back to her phone and began scrolling her social media. The lady of the couple challenged her about why she was looking at her phone rather than engaging with her. At this point the team member said it was Ryanair policy that she could use her phone in this way when staffing the gate.

My real point of contention is that when I raised this issue with Ryanair the Customer Service team have been very obstructive. In particular I have repeatedly asked them to answer two questions about their policy:

1) Are their staff permitted to use social media when handling travel documents and staffing the gate
2) Is it normal policy for staff to refuse passengers flight on little more than a whim

Customer Services has repeatedly ignored and refused to answer these questions.

In short, the boarding staff were very rude and aggressive to several passengers, and Customer Services have closed ranks and refused to answer very simple and straight forward qestions.

A company should be judged by how they respond when things go wrong, and Ryanair neither take accountability nor acknowledge the problem.

However, if you are travelling with kids or luggage, especially during cold winter months, stay away and go with a more reliable airline. I was supposed to travel with my 3 month old baby on 2 December from London to Prague. We boarded the plane and just sat there waiting without any information about why the plane is not moving. Finally after about an hour they said that there is an hour delay which meant another hour sitting on the plane. After that they finally said that the reason for the delay was something to do with deicing the plane, it was not done correctly and they had to wait for the truck to come and do it again. Another hour delay before it was announced by the pilot that there is some technical issue with the plane. Passengers were offered to leave the flight but it was not clear at that time what was going on. After about four hours on the plane the pilot finally decided that the plane was not going anywhere and everyone had to return to the main terminal and await more information regarding the flight and passengers should collect their luggage from belt 9. In the terminal there was no official sign or information given about the flight and I only received an email that my flight was rescheduled to 10:55pm (original flight time was 11:55am so I was at the airport with my baby since around 9.30am). The email also said that because the delay is more than 5 hours I can either change my flight to another day for free or get a refund. I could not wait for the late night flight because of my baby and I was not keen on travelling with Ryanair again so I was going to apply for a refund and fly another day with another airline. After this I spent another few hours waiting for my luggage because Ryanair customer service staff at the airport were completely incompetent and I had to literally force them to take my details so they can request my luggage to be taken from the plane as I was not planning to travel anymore (they left all the luggages on the plane despite earlier being told to pick the luggage from the belt). It was an absolute mess and I finally left the airport only about 8.30pm once I got my luggage. At no point during this time did the staff offer any sort of concern or extra care for me and my baby. I was sitting in the first row on the plane and they left the door open for over an hour with outside temperature about 3 degrees Celsius, my baby was sleeping on my lap and I could not even move to get my jacket that they took from me to put in the overhead lockers earlier. None of the staff offered any help and I had to ask a passenger sitting next to me if he could pass me my jacket so I can keep my baby warm. I went home, applied for a refund the same night and booked another ticket with EasyJet for two days later. I am still waiting on the refund that Ryanair said that I am entitled to. Just to add, around the same time last year I was stuck at the airport waiting for about 8 hours in the queue to speak to Ryanair customer services as my morning flight was cancelled and I desperately needed to get back to my family, only for them to tell me there is nothing they can do other than refund the ticket but I had to book a flight with another airline which was way more expensive because it was last minute. At least that flight took off! In a nutshell - stay away from Ryanair, their flights are unreliable but what is worse is their customer service is an absolute disgrace. I am never flying with Ryanair again and I'm hoping to get my money back. Definitely worth paying a little more for a better and safer experience with a more reliable airline."

I was about to burst but I just stay quiet. We say “How should we know if we need to go from the back?” She said “It’s written in your ticket!”. We showed her our tickets and nothing shown regarding back or front doors. And we said “So show us where is it written?”. Then she said “For sure we send you an email on the entry door”. 

3.1 How can you email us when we didn’t do online check in and our physical ticket is not written which door neither?

Ryanair refused to refund our flights as they said only family who die within 28 days are entitled, so as he died 2 days outside this window we cannot have a refund. This makes absolutely no difference to them, or their business, but the world to us at this emotionally stressful time. If someone had some sensitivity to apply to this situation, and saw we fly to Portugal several times a year with Ryanair to see our family as my wife is from Porto, and the sense to discuss this with some management, and even offer some form of compensation, as they will resell those seats.

“ I what actually happened was….”I think Ryanair are having trouble understanding! After the 5 delays with boarding as the times kept changing eventually we DID BOARD THE PLANE as did all of the other passengers, we were sitting on a full plane on the runway at stansted for 3 hours then an announcement from the pilot was we all had to disembark and go back into the airport terminal for information still in stansted…..timeline of events December 2nd THE PLANE DID NOT TAKE OFF FROM STANSTED.

Flight delayed to 10.50
Flight delayed to 11.20
Flight delayed to 12.30

We boarded the flight with all the other traveler's at 1300hrs
We sat in the plane on the runway at stansted for 3 hours until 1600hrs it did not take off
1600hrs all passengers asked to leave the plane, still in stansted. And we were all told to wait in departure for updated information no information came.

1900hrs we were told the flight was cancelled and there was no alternative flights, by Ryanair staff

So as per your reply below it’s not the case  we we had no intentions to make alternative travel and had no intentions to fly we in total we’re waiting for 14hours for the flight (3 hours of that on the plane)

Us and all of the other passengers after 14 hours of trying to fly your Ryanair staff didn’t know what to do, they gave passengers a piece of paper with terms and conditions on it, and said we would have to claim compensation online, they then said the flight was cancelled! Obviously we still wanted to go on holiday as the hotel, transfers, trips  etc were paid for, We asked the question as did other passangers for alternative flights and we were told there we No alternative flights 

We managed to to stay in a local hotel hoping for alternative arrangements the next day and there wasn’t any.

We tried for a refund on line as the fight was 5 hours late boarding and was then canceled, 

So in conclusion We DID board the plane, the plane never left the Airport “

I couldn't answer because the attendant didn't listen to me and just said credit card, I asked for that and without even explaining myself he said that I should pay I said that the backpack was always accepted and that I would take something out if necessary, he said I didn't have any more time and kept asking me for the card. I had a 6 day trip plan, so I thought I would miss my trip. But that wasn't all, when I used my cell phone to make the payment, it said it would have to be a physical card and it didn't accept cash. In short, the only reason I didn't lose my game was because a passenger passed the card to me and I took it, because with Ryanair I would have missed the trip and they wouldn't have done anything.

We finally check in despite the long line and poor customer service. Chasing our tails already we were left 40 minutes to get to the gate and assured we had enough time by the staff. Anyway we went to the gate but we had to get a stamp for some stupid reason a nonsense ryan air policy. That took 15 minutes in a line of 15 people waiting at a Ryanair desk/office booth for the one person working to get a stamp. Then we went to baggage control this took 20 minutes. With little time to spare we went to passport control. The line was enormous. As non EU passport holders you will know and as of brexit how long these lines can. Get. It took a long time to get through. Ryan air knew clearly about the long lines. We finally arrived to the gate only to be told we were not allowed to board. There were 20 other dismayed passengers shocked also told they couldn't board. I found this very callous as Ryan air knew that we were delayed by the long lines. They blamed us and the passport control for being so slow. After rushing as fast as we could with a 9 month crying baby I couldn't believe it. We were left stranded at 9pm at nigh. Also flights to Manchester and Dublin were closed earlier and many other passengers missed their flights. We were treated like animals and the customer service was shocking. They took no responsibility and just blamed us. When I complained they threatened to call the police. After speaking to the police they advised us not to book with Ryan air as this was typical occurrence with them. Also throughout our movements to the gate on the board it just informed us to go to the gate nothing about last call or gate closed unbelievable. In the end we were forced to get another flight with easy jet the next day. This cost us €380, plus a hotel booking €90 and taxi x2 €35 so in the end Ryan air cost us an additional €500. They completely threw us off the cliff leaving us stranded with a baby which was very stressful and with a big financial loss. Their lack of humanity and empathy shocked me. They knew full well a lot of their customers were stuck in lines but they showed no mercy and closed the gate. They could have waited for us. We are fighting now for a refund asking advice from Andalucia. Many of the passengers who booked the flights were forced to sleep in the airport overnight as they couldn't afford the accommodation. Also losing money with no refund and being forced to pay out for another flight. My best advice is unless you have no other option don't travel with Ryanair. The next day when we flew with easy jet it was relatively straightforward. No stamp nonsense and the check in sesk waa quick.

 I am writing to bring to your attention a distressing incident that occurred during my recent flight with Ryanair. I believe it is crucial for the airline to be aware of the details surrounding this incident so that appropriate actions can be taken to address the matter.

On 11/25, I was a passenger on Flight 574 from Bologne to Barcelona. Regrettably, I experienced a highly unsettling event during the boarding process, which has left me both emotionally and physically affected.

As I approached the boarding gate, an irate guest physically assaulted the boarding agent. When an unrelated passenger intervened behind me I was pushed to the ground. To make matters worse, this individual also assaulted a Ryanair employee and emotionally accosted several employees and passengers. Despite my immediate need for assistance and the safety concerns involved, the response from the airline staff was not only inadequate but also disheartening.

When I sought help from the Ryanair staff present, I was RUDELY informed that I could not film my attacker or the incident. This lack of support and failure to separate the assailant from the boarding process created an unsafe environment for passengers and contributed to the continuation of the altercation.

Moreover, the subsequent delay in the flight departure resulted in increased transportation costs for me. Due to these unforeseen circumstances, I had to incur additional expenses for alternative transportation arrangements. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE! Does anyone know if I can take this matter to the police? 

Before I was told to stop filming I managed to capture some of the video on camera if anyone would like to view the video I can add below."

At checkin the staff insisted the standard sized bags were too big and levied a £70 EACH charge plus, and heres the good bit, they want it again on the return flight so a total of £280 extra on top of the £90.52 already paid.

I called customer services, again utterly unhelpful and dismissive who said that it was excess weight and its charged at £11.00 per Kg extra.  Seeing as both cases were well under 10Kg, this means that each case was an additional 7Kg OVER, theres absolutely no way thats true so either they are lying or they have very dodgy scales at Ryanair Stanstead.

I wouldnt trust Ryanair to sit the correct way around on a toilet. Theres definitely zero trust from so many travellers now.

I can hand on heart promise though that I will NEVER ever again fly Ryanair. Just do a search on here and see how many times this happens daily to customers who have taken the time to measure and weigh before a flight.

She said I had to do the paid check in at the airport because my time had passed (which wouldn't have been the case if they had picked up earlier). Her whole argument was that I should have done the check in before. But I was on time - only then I realized the mistake, which is why I wasn't able to do the check in. I was early enough at the airport to do name change and check in, if there had been a help desk. Fortunately the friendly airport staff helped me and let me go through, even though my name was wrong and I """"only"""" paid for the check in at the airport, which shouldn't have been necessary with proper customer service (which was by the way more than my flight had cost).

Ryanair is terrible in my experience. Let me explain.
We scheduled a flight from Tangier to Lisbon with a layover and plane change in Paris. Due to a bomb scare in Paris, our flight went to Belgium. From there, we sat on the plane on the air strip for about an hour with no answers as to what would happen next. Then, they made us all get off the plane. No communication, just left there. I had to go to the ticket office to try to book another flight. There were no flights available, so I had to research nearby airports for possible flights.
I found a flight to Lisbon from Brussells. I then had to get bus tickets to take us (there were 5 of us, all family on vacation) and an uber from downtown Brussells to the Brussells airport, buy new tickets on another airline at high prices for same day tickets and got us to Lisbon very late that night.
Ryanair did not help in any of this at all. We were basically left stranded in another country with no way out.
I then filed a complaint with Ryanair about this. They asked for my confirmation number, passenger names and email address, which I provided.

Prior to contacting their customer service, they kept referring to it is a live update and their ticket prices will change blabla. However this is not a ticket and their system shouldn’t state a price prior the payment and when you have accepted you notice a different price being charged!

The issues at Edinburgh airport was farcical with no steps to take us of the plane we landed and we’re stuck for 20 minutes waiting for transport and steps to get if the plane unbearable not sure who’s fault that was but it just added to a crap experience.

Ryanair is a budget airline I get that .
The app is great but when it’s starts to go wrong it’s like they put their heads in the sand and give you the bear minimum of information with status pending updates. The pilot could tell us the plane had an issue that impacted every flight it was doing that day why can’t the App support that communication.

You need to do better . Cheap flights won’t encourage me to use RA I’ll be rethinking my transportation and who I use for the future.

I had the worst experience yesterday at the airport by one of your employees just before boarding the flight at 10pm. This man who called himself """"team lead"""" was outright aggressive, rude and humiliated me in front of the all the passengers. My bag was checked for over size at the gate for which I happily paid and requested the lady at the gate to confirm if I can keep the bag with me instead of putting it in hold since it had laptop and other battery operated devices. She took her time to check while I waited and then confirmed I can carry it. She put a yellow tag on my bag and said all was okay and I could proceed. On the ground however the man who called himself """"team lead"""" stopped me from boarding and asked me to handover over the bag. On clarifying to him that his colleague at the gate has confirmed to me that I can carry it, he yells at me in front of everyone and says """"i am the team lead, if I say you can't take the bag , then you can't take it"""". He then calls at the gate, and tells me that he is checking with the colleague (all in Polish, so I cant confirm what he really clarified). After the call tells me that """"she doesn't know anything, i am the team lead"""". Since it was raining, i told him that I have my laptop in the bag, how should I carry it in the rain, had your colleague told me inside that I had to put the bag in hold, i would make other arrangements. He then replies """"carry it in your hand or however, i don't care"""". I then somehow take it out and hand it over to my friend, and the guy returns and asks me to handover the bag. After I handover the bag, he follows me again and says that he is calling the police because he doesn't like the way I gave him the bag (not sure how many ways are there to handover a bag). I actually wanted the police to arrive so I could have described this harassment with all flight passengers as witnesses. After all this my friend requests him to let it go and then he agrees to stop with the harrassment. The employee clearly stated that """"i should have requested him to let the bag in and now je is letting it in because my friend apologized"""". 
Why am I taking time and writing this to you?
1) is a passenger supposed to know your inner hierarchy of who the team lead is and who isn't?
2) How many times should a passenger request and to how many people?
3) why did the lady put a yellow tag when she already confirmed that I can take bag in cabin?
4) why didn't she tell me that I had to also request the man who calls himself """"team lead""""? 

You are running a business so u probably are aware that for a passenger all Ryanair employees are same. For me the lady at the gate was Ryanair employee and I checked with her if the bag can be carried in the cabin.  

 I urge you to look into the mental health of your employees who are becoming modes of harassment to passengers. If the apparent """"team lead"""" let me carry the bag in eventually, what was the need of pulling this spectacle on the ground. I had to open my bag in front of all passengers, in rain on tarmac. 
The plane had quite some empty luggage storage space and the lady at the gate was also right. 
Plus for me or any passenger, lady at the check in gate or man at the ground are same people without differentiation (employees of Ryanair). 
That man being the team lead is ur internal business which I don't need to understand or be a part of or being YELLED AT.
I felt HARASSED at your airport and you have given power to unfit people to call cops on anyone they want to not realizing how it could be damaging to everyone. THIS IS SEVERE BULLYING ACCORDING TO ME.
I have raised a complaint on ur portal too in case you want other details of ur flight. I also welcome you to pull up my history of flying with you.

When I requested a password reset code, it didn't work for at least 7 times. They send you a code, but the website does not recognize it, which is frustrating. I tried from my mobile phone and again, the page would never upload. It's unbelievable how much stress you have to go through just to book a flight. Isn't this supposed to be the most exciting moment of your holiday? Unfortunately, not with Ryanair.

So, I tried to verify my identity online by uploading a picture of my id and my signature. There were two options, the standard verification, where you pay nothing, but have to wait a couple of days until you get an email about the successful (or not) verification or the express option, where you pay 0,59 cents and get it straight away. I did the standard one around 30 times on my phone and it never worked, then i did the express one and it also didnt work.

At first, if you want to sit together with your flight companions you needed reserve the seat. Ryanair expressly will seat you separately from each other as far, as possible. Its because after check in you still can reserve the seats, they do this to encourage you pay for the seats. At starts I think this is no problem until the boarding. At first our flight was delayed for an hour. Okey thats happens, but due this delayed outside starts heavy raining. We have priority boarding but after they checked our passes we stayed at the line about 40 minutes. I see how our plane landing, how passengers left our planes, and due all of this time I stayed in the line waiting our boarding. Lucky for me I was in the terminal for all this time, while some passengers in light wear waiting about 20 minutes outside. When we finnaly allowed to get on the board, the passengers who get first in the plane starts change with the seats and its make a traffic. In the end, when I finally get into the plane I was tottaly wet! And this was priority boarding! On the other side I saw behinde to us, how other low-cost company allow passengers get on the board one-by-one, to avoid the rain. I don't blame the crew, they try their best, but due to the extreme greed of the Ryanair company they makes additional problems for passengers and steward team. I flight with many other low-cost companies, and even they have options to reserve the seats, they still try to seat travel companions together, to avoid traffics and unexpected changes of the seats. So I will avoid this company, because I dont want to support their greed."

And options for extra baggage another joke. On departure we were told the flight that came in was busy so their stock was very low and also for people that just carry cash well its card only and when ure thousands of feet in the air you can't transfer or get cash into a bank account so we couldn't get anything not even a water.

Firstly, the seats are jam-packed into that plane. As a small lady of only 5'1, I still had to move my legs to either side as the legroom is just abysmal. Next, the air hostess' looked terrible? I've never encountered this before but one of them had stains all down her shirt and the other one had her zip halfway down her skirt so you could see her tights and top of her underwear? Surely if you're on a long shift the planes should stock extra uniform?

On the topic of staff, they seemed incredibly unprofessional. When boarding and leaving they were laughing amongst themselves, making jokes and I even saw one of them pointing and laughing at a slightly larger passenger. 

In one instance, the people behind us stood up as the staff were selling drinks. Granted, they did pick the wrong time to sort out their bags but the stewardess loudly proclaimed """"we are just like entertainment to you lot aren't we!""""

We felt unsafe on the landing as it was very rough, but not sure if this was to do with turbulence. 

On both of flights there and back, the staff had barely any drinks. And we were at the back ! (Where they started) we asked for hot chocolate and tea and they had neither so I'm not sure what they were selling?

As others have mentioned you cannot take one gram more than  the 5 lbs you are allowed to carry on board. I paid to take a carry on bag, it was under the mandatory weight limit and they still charged me. They know that once you are at the airport and have no other options they can do whatever they want to you.

What's even more frustrating is that my negative experience didn't end with the flight itself; it extended to their abysmal customer service.

First and foremost, my flight was delayed without any reasonable explanation. Delays can happen, I understand that, but the lack of communication and transparency from Ryanair was astounding. Passengers were left in the dark for hours with no updates or apologies, which made for a very frustrating and uncomfortable experience.

But what really takes the cake is Ryanair's customer service—or should I say lack thereof. I had the misfortune of having to deal with their customer service team to arrange compensation for the delay. Let me tell you, it has been an absolute nightmare.

I have spent over a month trying to get a resolution, and it seems like Ryanair's customer service team is trained to be unhelpful and evasive. Every time I called, I was met with dismissive responses like, """"We are unable to assist you; please email our team."""" So, I followed their advice and emailed them repeatedly, only to receive generic, automated responses that did not address my specific questions or concerns. It's as if they have a playbook for how to avoid actually helping their customers.

I understand that airlines can face challenges and delays, but the mark of a good airline is how they handle such situations and how they treat their customers. In the case of Ryanair, it's clear that they couldn't care less about their passengers' well-being or satisfaction.

I strongly advise anyone considering flying with Ryanair to think twice. You may save a few bucks on the ticket price, but the endless frustration, lack of transparency, and abysmal customer service make it simply not worth it. I'm still awaiting resolution for my compensation claim, and I'm not holding my breath. Ryanair, you've lost a customer for life, and I will make sure to share my terrible experience with anyone who will listen."

Flight out: 
Luton airport wasnt too bad got through everything a bit faster than gatwick but once we boarded the plane and sat down. 3 passengers got on and sat 1 row back on the opposite side steaming drunk. They were shouting, swearing and getting aggressive to each other. There was 3 babies sat very close by these people who i thought were going to have a fist fight any minute. 
The woman sat near to us said they had been drinking all day in the lounge before the flight and were falling over/struggling to walk to the plane. The man in the group was getting up and trying to storm off the plane while they were closing the doors and then turning around to argue some more with the 2 women he was with. It was extremely uncomfortable for everyone onboard. He finally sat down and we took off but the fight continued for 3 hours. They ordered at least 5 bottles more of vodka and wine when they were already blackout drunk. Why would the staff continue to serve clearing drunk and belligerent people? Its not safe for anyone on the flight. Matt if you're reading this review you're a prick and you should move out of Donnas house to save everyone having to listen to you whinging all flight.

Flight back:
The same 3 passengers were sat a row away from me again, this time less drunk so they didnt cause too many problems.
We got to the airport and queued for over an hour at check in, we were near the front of the queue and a group of people just walked passed every passenger and pushed in front and were thankfully told by the man at the desk to go to the back of the queue but they pushed in somewhere near the middle instead. They printed new boarding passes because the machines were not working for phone/self printed passes apparently and then it was to another queue at security where people who were not informed of this were being sent away to go back to check in. There was no staff members or signs or announcements informing anyone of this issue so it cause major delays and upsets. We get through security and go to our gate, nowhere to sit at all. airport is not fit for purpose. Supposed to have begun boarding at 9.05pm and gate close at 9.15pm. Gate opened at 9.10 and the same family pushed in front of the line and were allowed to do so. We wait outside to be all crammed into a bus and then be stuck in the bus for entirely too long. We get onboard and sit down theres a few empty seats but its now 9.20 so gates should be closed. by about 9.30 another bus arrives with a few passengers, we think that must be it so we should make our take off time of 9.45p. No, we are stuck sitting on this plane until 10.30pm when the last 6 passengers finally show up and are seated. Why am i being delayed so much for 6 people? Take off without them, if they cant get to the airport on time then thats their fault.
One woman who was with the last 6 people took about 20 minutes to sit down, i dont know what her issue was but she was walking in slowmo down the isle. Her seat was row 4 and it took her a ridiculous amount of time to get there. Air staff were not at all helpful, they didnt once communicate what was going on to anyone on the flight. Just left us to sit there waiting, everyone was angry and tired and we had absolutely no information from anyone.

This was our first time ever experiencing something like this, with no point of direction from anyone we immediately went to find the Ryanair help desk. As we approached what I can only describe as unorganised chaos we waited for over 3 hours in a queue with no aircon, no refreshments and people shouting. As we approached the front of the queue , it seemed like a good idea to write a list of questions and get up our rights in this situation and your duty of care as Ryanair staff members . 
When we finally got to the desk after 3 hours of waiting , 3 of the most unhelpful women approached us with a sheet of paper and a pen . As we began to ask questions about what is to come next? What happens? Are we going to be put in a hotel? Will our flight be rescheduled? The woman on the desk claiming to be “manager “ when I would personally not let her manage a herd of animals highlighted a link on a piece of paper , told us we will get compensated and advised us to be on our way. At this point everyone is confused as to what we are supposed to do for 2 nights until the next flight ? No one has given us any information regarding another flight? We have no money , our phones are dead and we haven’t eaten or drank in 6 hours, and all your staff can say is “please leave the queue it’s big enough” ! After we started to ask for more questions , your ‘’manager” got irate and started to shake her hands about and refused to speak to us, we pulled out our rights and Ryanair’s duty of care and began to explain this to be told by another one of your useless staff members that this is “fake and wrong” . At this point I realised what a waste of time any of the members of staff were and asked people who had already been served in the queue , to be told they were being put in a hotel or were given money to pay for it? When we were not offered anything other than “possible money back in a months time”?????? And told to “ask family and friends for money” . We left the queue in rage and decided where to go from here , with nothing but a sheet of paper with highlighted links on and the unique ID numbers off the terrible staff members . After approaching someone else in the queue she advised us go to the check in desk and ask them to get us another flight to the UK. As we approached another 2 hour long queue we waited and waited , still with no refreshments, air con or help. As we got to the front the lady asked us how she can help and managed to get us a flight on MONDAY 18th September to NEWCASTLE . Being grateful to just have a flight back to the UK we took it, we asked the staff member on this desk for advice as to hotels and if we get the money back etc and she said that you will get all expenses and compensation back. We went on our way and had to them ring and family to explain our situation which luckily allowed us to book us a hotel for 2 nights . Imagine we didn’t have this? Would we be on the streets for 2 nights? We booked the cheapest all inclusive hotel for 2 nights for 6 of us so we could at least eat while we were there . Monday approached us and we are getting ready for our flight at 21:50 to Newcastle knowing we have a long way ahead of us travelling as Ryanair offered us no way of getting from Newcastle to Manchester so we knew we had to get a 3hr train journey . We quickly checked on flight radar to see if our flight was on time , to see it was delayed by 3 hours . With no information on my travel itinerary regarding this we made our way to check in the airport , we asked a staff member on the desk if this was correct and she said yes so we then had to wait in the airport with no money for an additional 3 hours? Getting annoyed at the lack of communication with Ryanair we were just happy to be making our way to UK ground. After paying for seats on the plane next to each other and all being put in random seats next to random people my rage began to grow as 5/6 of us are nervous flyers . The refreshment cart comes round on the plane as we finally leave at 00:30 ish to my surprise there’s no refreshments left ! We get off the plane , have to fork out for a taxi to Newcastle train station and arrive back in Manchester at 8am the following morning after leaving Ibiza at 6pm. We then have to fork out another taxi to actually arrive home. Ryanair it’s safe to say you drastically failed at providing your duty of care to your customers . I will tell everyone on my platforms of social media and work of mouth my experience including newspapers never to travel with yourselves . You treated us like animals.

Its difficult to lay all the blame with the airline.

I was pointed to a machine to pay the additional 70 euro oversized bag fee, that is in addition to their normal 49 euro baggage fee for a 2nd carry on.  However, I was not instructed to check my baggage at a any check-in desk, but rather understood that the aircraft staff would check my bag at the plane, that is not an uncommon procedure.  At the plane, the steward to my confusion acted surprised that my bag was flagged at all and instructed me to simply load the bag myself into the overhead cabin compartment where it easily fit.  Two complaints.  The bag size qualification at the gate clearly does not align with the aircraft compartment capability.  Second, any additional 70 euro fee must be provided with an actual act of service.  In my case, this appears as an easy 70 euro profit for Ryanair at my frustration.

On 06 Sep 2023, I had a flight from Charleroi airport Brussels to Athens International Airport through Ryanair, and without exaggeration, booking that flight was one of the worst decisions I have ever made. Ryanair's policy is to deceive people by providing cheap prices. However, their terrible policies are set in a way that makes you eventually pay more than other decent airlines. I asked the boarding representative to book two seats next to each other (regardless of the location) for my wife and I. The representatives answer was no, and he said I have to separate you as per Ryan's air policy because this is a paid service even though we had multiple seats empty on the air craft. 
One more point is there hidden online check-in thing. Once I arrived to the airport, Ryan's air representative informed me that I had to pay 55 Eur for each person for airport boarding because the online boarding (the free one) gets locked 2 hours before the flight because they offer cheap flights prices. This is absolutely absurd and never heard of.   The boarding is always done on the airport counter for all companies and if there is additional fees, the online check in must remain open. I encountered a similar issue with Volotea airline and they simply you can do it in the airport for additional fees or you can download it from our website for free and that was one hour before departure.
Overall, I believe that Ryanair is the worst airline company ever and I wouldn't even recommend it to my worst enemies. Their rude and sneaky policies make you literally pay more than other comparable tickets with decent airlines.

We were delayed by almost an hour and a half waiting on board the plane to depart with little to no information of what was going on. We eventually departed and started our flight to Palma Airport. Mid way through the flight we experienced severe turbulence as we flew through a storm. The pilots managed this amazingly.
When we got half an hour away, we were told we were about to land. We then heard through the tannoy that we had to be diverted to Valencia Airport, which was over half an hour from where we currently were. We flew to Valencia and were told we would be able to board another flight soon after to Palma, but there may be a couple of hours wait, which we didn’t mind at all.
May I also add, the pilot and the crew apologised on behalf of them and actually said they aren’t apologising on behalf of Ryanair themselves. 
Once we got to Valencia and landed, we sat on the plane for over an hour again before we were told we couldn’t fly to Palma and that if we did we would be entering another storm. 
Our alternative was a 9 hour ferry! 
Once we got off of the plane, we had to wait for our bags. We were told at the airport we needed to keep moving and follow everyone, but we didn’t have our bags and they were nowhere to be seen. We hunted for them, eventually being pushed out of the airport into a queue of people and told we would be able to get them soon, 
Our bags had been moved to a conveyorbelt for a flight from Manchester, 
I had to try and speak to several Spanish people who spoke NO English to beg for them to let us have our bags back, they refused and were very rude shunning me to the side and ignoring me. I went through the security section to get them back and was shouted at again several times, I was absolutely balling my eyes out the whole time. I was told I needed to go and speak to the Ryanair rep at the Ryanair station in the airport, there was no one there and absolutely no one to speak to.

I eventually managed to get hold of someone through going through security again who actually helped me. By this time, we had no idea where to go next. 
We went outside to find a man from Ryanair and asked him what we needed to do, he said we needed to wait for a coach and that the coach would be taking us to Valencia Port to catch a Ferry from there to Palma. 
We waited 4 hours, one coach showed up in this time and three coaches drove past us. It was scorching heat, there were children who hadn’t been to the toilet in well over 4 hours and none of us had eaten in that time in fear that if we left the queue we would miss out spot on the coach. The Ryanair reps were again, nowhere to be seen during these 4 long hours. There were children and babies screaming.
After 4 long hours of waiting outside in the boiling heat, a coach turned up. As the Bristol flight was the first one to land, we were all assured that we would board the first coach to Valencia Port. Once the coach actually arrived to pick us up, we were then told that Bristol weren’t boarding first, again by a Ryanair rep. So we’d waited the longest, and been promised a spot on the first coach that arrived and then you again let us all down. 
After several words and lots of tears from several passengers you let us from the Bristol flight board the coach. Once we were all packed into the coach you then decided to tell us that we weren’t going to Valencia Port, but we were actually going to Barcelona Port which was another 4 hour journey in a hot, ram packed coach. Your Ryanair rep then told us, we couldn’t stop, there were no toilets on board or else we would be late for our ferry. 

Again, I’ll reiterate there were CHILDREN, ELDERLY and PREGNANT WOMEN on board that coach that hadn’t been to the toilet and NONE of us had eaten anything. Do you think this is acceptable? You lied to us, gave us ALL false hope and didn’t even think to go around and hand out bottles of water or light snacks so that we were at least hydrated in the 28 degrees heat we’d been very patiently waiting in..?

Several people got off of that coach after hearing the news that we wouldn’t be going to where you said we would be. We sat for 4 long hours, without sleep, without food, water and without toilet breaks. With screaming babies, crying children, and one young girl who needed the toilet THAT bad, her parents asked the driver to stop and he refused several times that there was a full blown argument, shouting from both parties. That same young girl ended up having to go for a poo in a bag on a coach FULL of people because you chose the most inhumane mode of travel for us. We had NO ventilation and had to sit there for another 3 hours breathing in the smell of this poor girls poo. Can you even begin to imagine what we all had to go through, including that poor girl who must have been SO embarrassed having to poo on a coach full of people with no way of cleaning herself?!

After we got there, we weren’t told anything at all. We waited in a queue of people for an hour again, by this time it was gone 11 at night. We were then told we had to pay for our ferry ticket and that Ryanair REFUSED to take any part in paying for our ferry tickets which again is absolutely DISGUSTING. 

All of the passengers argued this and eventually they gave us all the tickets for free. We again were told so many different things about where we needed to go next in order to get onto the ferry. This again took over an hour, it was then 12am. 
Once we boarded the ferry, we were told we couldn’t sit in the comfy seats and that we had to sit in some rattan chairs FOR 9 HOURS. Where we’re out beds? Where were our pillows, our blankets? Nowhere to be seen. You should have provided us with beds and a room to freshen up in. To get comfortable in. To rest in, but you didn’t. A whole day and a half of our holiday gone in which we would have been at our hotel room and we still had to sit in the most vile conditions. All of the passengers from our flight were sat on the most uncomfortable chairs, covering ourselves with our holiday towels and clothes from our suitcases to keep warm and comfortable. We sat for over an hour again before we left the dock. 1:25am we still hadn’t left, my mother, my sister and my auntie and uncles had ALREADY LANDED into PALMA, their flight was at 6:40pm the SAME DAY as our flight and we still had another 9 hours to go before we got to the Palma Ferry Port, not even to our hotel.

The ferry was one of the worst journeys I’ve ever been on in my life, it was so choppy and horrible and extremely scary, no one told us what was going on. I’m TERRFIED of being at sea and we were told there was no other option and if we did choose another mode of transport we wouldn’t get any money back. 
The food was absolutely disgusting, freezing cold and we paid €26 for it, again, out of our OWN money. 
After a horrible and terrifying 9 hours, we arrived. We didn’t have any guidance of where we needed to go or what we needed to do next. 
You dropped us off at the ferry dock and told us nothing. There was no transfer, and when I contacted loveholidays regarding this you did NOTHING to help. You left us in a foreign country with no clue on what to do and how to get from here to our hotel. 
You told me we couldn’t get our money back for the transfer, you told us we couldn’t get picked up from the port to the hotel, you told us we needed to complain so here it is, here is our complaint. 
This doesn’t even scratch the surface of how upset, disappointed and dissatisfied we are. Your service is disgusting and you should be ashamed. 

My family got to the hotel a whole day earlier than us and we were scheduled to get there 9 hours before them. 
We then had to get an Uber which would have cost us €202 to our hotel, we put through for this but it was then cancelled. 
We sat stranded for over an hour trying to work out how to get to the hotel. If it wasn’t for my own family and a lovely English gentleman helping us we would still probably be there now. 
We had to then run to the bus station and I have extremely bad ankles so can barely walk far let alone run and then get a bus for almost 2 hours from the dock to the hotel. 
We eventually got to our hotel to meet our family over 34 hours later. We had been travelling on NO sleep, barely any food and water for over 34 hours because you couldn’t do your jobs properly. 
We didn’t actually get to our hotel until 2pm on Monday the 28th, 

You could have easily put us on a later flight after the storm had passed which is what happened with my family, but you didn’t with us, why was that? 
You chose to allow us to all board a coach, a ferry and then leave us to work out what to do afterwards. 
I’m expecting a response in full or I will be taking this further. 
You don’t deserve to get away with treating people like this, your social media is disgusting the way it demoralises your passengers and you proved you do exactly that on our travels with you. I don’t care at this point how budget you call your airlines, or how low cost loveholidays pride themselves on being, the way you treat people is completely and utterly diabolical. I have never cried so much and been so stressed in my life, my partner also. It was one of the most stressful things we’ve been through and I wouldn’t wish this on anyone. 

I have proof of everything I’ve spoken about in this letter.
You need to do better, treat people with respect and show compassion for the people who give you their money to get them to and from destinations with ease, comfort and safety. 
I’m also aware that a storm is out of your control, but everything after landing was down to you and your poor decision making. Like I said further up on this email, my family got there before us so you COULD have allowed us to board another flight but you still thought best to let us go through some of the worst 32 hours of our lives. I’m damn sure I’m not the only person who has complained from our flight either!!

I would like to add, at NO point have our hotel been at fault. They were amazing from the moment we got here, so kind, supportive and mindful of the travels we had just had to go through to get there. They put us in a room farthest away from the noise so we could rest, offered us a discount on the hotel because we missed a day. They have been amazing."

Silly mistake, I'm sure many people knew this. I just want to warn everyone who does not already know. NEVER book your parking through Ryanair. It looks like a saving but if they change anything you've wasted your money and have to scratch round booking to park at the last minute.

Seats on the flight - so you wait patiently to be able to select your seats and not face an additional £8 charge per seat and when checking in 24 hours before the flight you note that you are all sat seperately and there is 'still' an additional charge to change your seats. Then on getting on the flight you see all parties are sat seperately - trying to avoid the yet further additional costs added to sit with their partner/carer/friend. To see people trying to sit together and swap seats was very sad - people anxious about flying - couples and siblings and friends who would usually sit together. On my return flight I had the luxury of some additional leg room as I had been allocated a front seat. However people in the seats on the opposite side had taken empty seats. One was registered deaf and needed her carer/chaperone to sign language to her. The air hostess explained to them that they had wrongly taken seats that had to be empty to ensure the plane is balanced and safe for flight. They did not want to move as they needed to stay together. I understand they should have booked seats together but minutes before the flight departed I felt obliged to move so they could have my seat! I ended being last off the flight so I could get back down the front to get my onboard luggage.

Landing experience - Whilst we did land safely I have to say it felt like both landing experiences were pretty shocking particularly the return flight where I would not be surprised if people had whiplash. The brake applied on landing was extreme and threw everyone forward in their seats.  

Delays - The flight out and our return flight were delayed by an hour. Our departing flight we were told there was a 20 minute boarding delay that turned out to us being an hour late arriving back in Bristol. An hour being the total flight time - the impact of this is there and yet no apologies or recognition of this! My daughters flight out to Dublin was also an hour late - this was because they were waiting for passengers to get on! Really?

Gate allocation and notification of delays  - on our flight out to Dublin we were given ten minutes notice to get to our gate before it closed. The departure gate was not announced until ten minutes before. Again really? 

On our return flight our gate number changed after we had sat there for half an hour - there was no notification on the app and we just overheard people saying. Staff were not proactive informing us and it was a case of passengers informing each other! 

Complaint emailed - automated resonse with links to key words in my complaint!

The alright things, planes are fine and flights were almost on time, seats are uncomfortable and there is very little leg room. Staff were good and this is what probably saves Ryanair in terms of flights. Paying extra for a cabin bag seemed to be a waste of money as people who were in the non-priority queue appeared to have cabin bags which would have to go into the overhead lockers.
Where Ryanair really fails is with customer service, there is none. We were stuck as part of the air traffic control failure and even allowing for that Ryanair customer service was non-existent. Their representatives on the ground were clueless and we had to fight for everything which were our legal rights according to the e-mail sent by Ryanair. At one point a member of the Ryanair team pulled a blind down rather than deal with us. The worst situation was where we were lied to by Ryanair representatives, on the second morning we arrived at the airport as requested the previous evening to go on the standby queue for flight. We were told the flight was full and the standby queue was full, after much arguing we finally were allowed on the full standby queue. We presented ourselves at the gate and we were told that we had been allocated seats on the flight that was full. A family member checked if it was possible to book a seat on the flight we were on and yes Ryanair were selling seats on the full flight!!!

Refund for one passenger and all flights or refund for one flight and one passenger. As option 2 passengers one flight wasn’t available I chose what I thought could be okay. The next day I got email from Ryanair that I’m getting a refund for Ryanair app. The amount was for the whole flight and because this wasn’t something I requested I went for Ryanair app to find out that our return flight is not there anymore. I phoned their helpline to be spoken by EXTREMELY rude staff who advised me that this is my mistake and there is nothing they can do.

I’ve received email from them saying this is 3rd party booking so they block it and to unblock it we need to do extra verification at extra cost (cheap but still). Comes to the end this flight was delayed by 1.20 hour. Literally all flights on the screen were perfectly fine but most Ryanair’s were delayed. At the end we even waited on the plane because they were missing people and they couldn’t balance the weight. This is really ridiculously funny. We also tried to apply for compensation which was refused as it wasn’t Ryanairs fault. There was an error with flight control.

1. The seats on the plane are ok, just like with the other low cost companies.
2. Disturbing is the mess on the plane and the sticky and scratchy seats..
3. But the worst thing is their way of landing, the first time I thought it was just a coincidence and that maybe it was wind or something else, the second time I said the same that it was wind, but the third time I was already convinced that it always lands like this, so the problem is with the pilots (or autopilot, respectively the software), because the aircraft are the same as with the other companies. First of all, the descent is extremely sudden, even brutal, I would say, and upon contact with the ground you actually have the feeling that the plane will fall to pieces at how aggressive the touch is. For these horrible sensations I promised that I would not fly with them again, unfortunately last month in August I had to fly with them round trip to Crete, just like when I landed in Chania, it was horrible but on the way back, when landing at the airport Otopeni, I had the worst experience in my life with airplanes, upon landing the pilot or the software (I don't know if it is relevant but the pilot was a woman, and it was the first flight in my life with a woman as pilot) only touched the ground at half of the runway (I know that runway perfectly, I know exactly where it touches the ground) and as a result he had to brake BRUTALLY so that the plane started to veer to the left almost leaving the runway, at which point a second brutal brake followed which caused the planes to move left-right, at which point the runway ends and the plane turns suddenly to the left, thus managing not to go out on the verede space (I mention that it was perfect weather without wind, clear).
4. This aspect besides the one in point 3 is nothing, but it must be said, and the fault in this case is only the employees of this company at the boarding point in Chania, I have been traveling for 2 years with the same luggage, I flew with most companies in Europe, with Ryanair I flew about 6-8 times with this luggage, in Chania it seems that this luggage did not comply, because the wheels on the luggage exceeded the height of the luggage by 0.5 cm (I always fly with priority) and for this reason I paid an extra 65 euros."

Except for a scary landing in Alicante due to high local winds I have no issues with the staff or plane. However I do have an issue with the first flight out in the morning taking off 1 hour and a quarter late for no other reason than the plane NOT being refuelled overnight. Surly the first flight out each morning should be on time otherwise not only does it delay the first passengers of the day but has a knock on effect for that plane for the rest of the day. Simple solutions is for plane to be refuelled either as soon as it’s last flight the day before or at least overnight so it is ready for the start of a new day. My second issue is an ongoing one and I have pointed it out in a couple of previous reviews. Prior to our flight out to Spain each September we receive an email from Ryan Air stating that if your flight departs prior to 7am from Stansted there will be a bag drop open from 2.30am. Each year when we arrive early at the airport to take advantage of this bag drop service we find nothing open to drop bags and staff at airport not having a clue about this service offered but when you show them the email they get very shirty and tell you you have to wait till normal check in opening times. Every year we get this email and every year the service NOT provided or known about. Either sort out staff at airport so they know about this email and actually action it, it can lead to some very annoyed customers.

Initially the flight was delayed until after 23.00 due to a minor technical fault. We boarded at 23.30 but missed the airport curfew so had to disembark and stay overnight in a hotel. Whilst disembarking I received a text from Ryanair to say the new take off time would be 11am and that I could wait for them to organise a hotel and transfers or organise myself and claim back the expense. I opted for the latter.

I immediately booked a room online for the only airport hotel at Hamburg and managed to checkin and get to bed around 1am. By he time I had checked in however, the queue at the hotel was already stretching out the door. 

To Ryanair's credit they kept me well informed throughout the delay with timely updates of new departure times. The following day I submitted all my receipts through their expenses portal and immediately their customer service team were looking for ways to avoid paying out. In our first email exchange they claimed that one of my receipts was illegible so would not be paid out. They also had the audacity to call my hotel stay excessive (coming from an airline that charges 55EUR to checkin at an airport!!) and initially only paid out 80EUR of the total 169EUR cost. After pointing out that their crew stayed at the same hotel they paid my hotel claim in full but are still being difficult around a meal expense claim on what they are saying is an 'illegible' receipt. Note I was only given a 4EUR voucher during the 16hr delay by the airline!

I have now received payment of my expenses (minus the meal on the 'illigible' receipt) and 250EUR compensation which you are entitled to under EU law.

Ryanair were really slow. Then walked straight to security and waited 25 minutes to get through with 3 children and a baby. They took my partners bag without telling us and we had 6 trays to put all our stuff in as they were moaned if there were more than 1 bag in each try and the children's tablets couldn't be bovered with anything on top. With all the chaos we walked off without the bag as we had a buggy and children's rucksacks etc. A few minutes later we realised we didn't have the bag so ran back for it and the security weren't any help as said they don't have it. I then had to ask another person and she said oh yes we do have it. (They took it as their was aftershave in it) but they didn't inform us they had taken it to inspect. We then had to run the the boarding gates as everyone was alr3ady boarding. We got to the shuttle and the doors kept opening and closing. This happened 5 times and took 10 minutes to move. By this time we had missed our flight. If we weren't in the check in queues for 50 minutes due to Ryanair being very slow we would have made the flight. However as usual Ryanair will not take responsibility. We then were told we can pay £100 for a confirmed flight the next day which we did. After handing thr man behind thr customer service desk my card and checking my bank account later I see they charged me £500!! When he said £100 it was a lie. It was actually £100pp which was false information. I've contacted them but once again they won't do anything about and just keep saying it's £100 and further along in the email mention per person.
Also turns out this confirmed flight with 5 seats which he said was left and we paid £500 for was a lie as well. We were only on standby and had to wait for everyone to board before they would give us a seat on the plane. If we had known this we would have waited at the airport on the day we actually missed out flight as there were 2 flights going out that day but we didn't want to risk it as he assured us we had a confirmed flight. Ryanair then gave us seat numbers on the plane and when we got on after all the stress of not knowing if we will be going and crying children thise seats weren't even available. She left us others board after the gates would have closed and gave us their seats and then let them on after giving us theore seat numbers. My 7 year old was sat by himself on the flight which I'm sure isn't even allowed by they won't answer my question when I ask.

We booked 3 tickets ( 2 regulars and one with priority ). For the priority we had a luggage we used before with no problem. The flight from Bucharest to London was ok except the fact we stayed 1 hour in the plane in London due to a fire alarm. When the alarm was gone, every plane on the tarmac except ours was granted to disembark. When we asked why we can't disembark they just told us to wait with no reason provided.

Anyway it wasn't that big of a deal but we had a surprise for the return flight:
Again 1 hour delay.
On top of that, at the queue at the gate, there was no separate line for priority. For us wasn't that big of a deal because we are not the kind to be afraid to wait.

The peak of the experience:
The guy at the gate told us the 10 kg bag is to big and that we have to pay 45 GBP to put it on cargo hold. We argued for 20 minutes and then we decided to pay and then make a complaint.
Magically, when we paid, the guy didn't take the luggage and we took it into the cabin. That was the most stupidest thing I have ever seen in my life. Maybe this is their way to squeeze as much money from you as possible.

Congratulation Ryanair, you won 45 GBP and lost 3 customers. Nice marketing.

Why were we allowed to be checked in and go through security when it must have already been known that this flight was going to be cancelled?????? A big thumbs up to the baggage handlers at Edinburgh airport who did get our checked in baggage back to us as soon as they could. We then had to exit the airport to go back in again as we were advised that there were Ryanair staff at a desk behind Starbucks, no there wasn’t, only the air handlers for them but no actual Ryanair staff, so no-one to advise as it’s now all done online. Repeated attempts to contact Ryanair customer service (which doesn’t open until 09:00 - not much good if your issue is earlier than that) to no avail as the phone was just ringing out with no-one answering. Next flight to Bari with this airline was not until Saturday 2nd September( that is supposing you could actually get booked on this!). We decided that we would ask for refund and request this online……. reading lots of other reviews I am not confident that this will happen in a timely manner, jury is out on that one for now.
With all their other tricks with paying for extra bags etc & the fact they had no contingency plans in place to advise customers of their options we won’t be flying with this company again.

Be advised don’t travel with this company unless you want to be disappointed.

Information around what would happen was not forthcoming & that would have remained the case had I not taken a taxi back to the airport the following morning to spend the first day of my holiday seeking out a Ryanair representative who could let me know what was happening. At no point was an email or a phone call made. Hundreds were affected & the question which was never answered was how can a flight leave without bags? My belief is that it can only have in some way been financially beneficial to Ryanair for this to happen, they always put profits ahead of its clients. The only way this will change is if we vote with our feet & I intend to never give this shower another cent.
You would think that an organisation would meet their legal obligations in respect of causing their clientele additional cost & inconvenience. But with Ryanair as this would eat into their profit margins they have other ideas. These being a ridiculously onerous claims process on their website that I am sure many would give up on. Then when you have navigated this hurdle they completely ignore the claim. When you then find a number & get to speak to someone they tell you to start the process again. I have just finished writing a formal complaint letter as a next step ahead of raising the matter with the aviation adr & then submitting a claim for breach of contract with the small claims court.

After waiting for more than 35 minutes, I was finally attended by one of their male employees and when I got to the counter, I greeted and told him my destination was Ibiza, Spain. However, he didn’t pay attention and to whom I mentioned again that my flight was for Ibiza.

To my surprise, he informed me that the passenger information I had given to the airline was incorrect that only my surname was right; given name and ID number were totally different from my passport. Unfortunately, my phone was lost the night before so I had no access to my email to show him my booking reference, but believed him which was the biggest nightmare ever. He then talked to other colleague on the phone in Spanish looking for a solution and interrogated me in a gruntled manner that if I booked the ticket myself and how did I manage to input all the details mistakenly and that I should be at the airport at least 45 minutes before my flight. I asked if he got my passport number correctly and that if the ID number was starting with Y (my other ID), to which he simply replied that he didn’t know. He said he could amend the name on the ticket by rebooking it, which would be an extra 160€ that I needed to pay by credit card at the spot. I proceeded with payment and he called one of his senior staff to approve the transaction.

The whole process took another 30 minutes and he finally gave me a boarding pass with my name on it but the destination was for Birmingham. I felt utterly violated by this that I expressed again that I was going to Ibiza and he reluctantly searched by my passport number and successfully found my name on the flight to Ibiza. He got so angry and tore the credit card slip for 160€ and the boarding pass for Birmingham than right away, that I would not have any evidence left. It was then I realised he presumed I was flying to Birmingham the whole time and searched by my surname which led him to another passenger with the same surname as mine who happened to be going to Birmingham on 15 Aug 2023. Basically, he replaced my details with that passenger’s original booking, meaning I would not have a confirmation email nor reservation number for that.

He defended that they handle thousands of thousands passengers a day and that my surname is very common so it was a pure system error instead of his own mistake. Also, he would refund me for the flight paid for Birmingham. Turned out he did not refund me and I have been trying to reach out to Ryanair by hotline, email and Facebook but to no avail because they kept asking me for the reservation number for the flight to Birmingham which I would never be able to provide.

My theory on what is happening here is that Ryanair let's people simultaneously see its cheaper prices while not actually reserving those prices when those people go through with the booking.

Once I got to actually paying, I was miraculously reverted back to the homepage without my tickets and the prices now being 30% more expensive.

We asked a stewardess ( cabin crew member 2) if we could have a life vest for our infant's. She explained it was under our toddler's seat.. he was seated between my husband and I and our 1 year old daughter was on my lap. They were clearly busy so she rushed off.. as she walked past us again my husband explained that it wasn't my toddler's life vest we asked about.. but rather our daughter's - who was on my lap. The stewardess snapped at my husband, raised her voice and started with 'Can you understand what I said when I told you it was under his seat!' I intervened and asked her if she understood that we were just asking for clarity on our child's safety.. at which point she yelled at me. I asked her for her name and cabin crew number to which the response was that she wanted mine. Being a pilot by profession - I was horrified at this condescending and frankly, poor behaviour. She could easily get my details off the passenger list anyway. I requested to speak to the cabin crew manager from another stewardess. The cabin crew manager, Alexandra P. was kind.. but oddly hid her name tag when I requested her name and said her rude colleague's name is protected due to data privacy?? She apologised on behalf of her colleague to which we explained she didn't need to apologise, it was on her colleague to apologise to my husband... of course she said she'd speak to her colleague but we heard nothing thereafter... in fact we weren't offered drinks nor was our trash collected... we were simply ignored when ever Cabin crew member #2 walked past.

I just want to make it clear that I am very much aware of how tough a job they have. However, responding in such an aggressive and rowdy manner to 2 parents who just asked where their baby's life vest is, is inexcusable. Asking if 2 native english speakers -  when she herself was Spanish and did not speak english very well - is condescending. The young man behind us filmed the entire episode from the moment she started shouting at us. So we are looking forward to seeing this air with his 2million plus followers.

The flight there was actually ok - the return flight was completely the opposite. First of all Ryan air say that East midlands to dublin is a 65 minute flight time. It took us 35 minutes ( which is also the same for my last 3 visits to dublin). Upon returning we were due to fly at 20.20 and this would mean arriving at 21.25. Once we got through check in and security we saw that out flight had been delayed 20 minutes. ( This happens from time to time so no big deal). We were due to fly at 20.40 from gate 116. An hour later the board changed to 20.55 gate 112. (Again,no big deal just change gate and wait a little longer). Whilst waiting in the que to board at 112 - it then gets to 21.20 - gate still says 20.55 boarding... we hear we are now moving to gate 105 and could we be quick as the gates are open and we're loading... we rush 7 minutes away to get there and start boarding... finally we're on our way - we board the plane and get sat down in our seats ready for take off. The captain the comes on the intercom to speak to all passengers - sorry for the delay we've had some issues with 2 earlier flights but we're now ready to leave. Great.... we're then sat there in our seat..repeatedly told to remain seated and do not take off our seat belts...for a further hour and 20 mins. By this time its 22.50 - (2 hours 10 minutes after our original boarding time). We look on ryan air websites at policies... after a 2 hour delay ryan air WILL offer - a change of flight if required,transfers,hotel,food and drink for FREE - a lady actually pointed this out to staff - taking into consideration we hadn't been offered as much as any water..free or otherwise - there were children,pregnant women,disabled and older people aboard this plane... and I'm 45 but would of greatly appreciated a drink of water. Anyway after a little commotion and a few words exchanged we se set off... we got to the runway waiting for to take off - we then sat there engine's blaring for a further 50 minutes ( on the runway,which is a first for me I must say) then took off at 23.40 - this is now exactly 3 hours after our original take off time.  Whilst in the air the stewardess comes round with a trolly of refreshments...payable as uusal rate - an old lady opposite us shows the stewardess the policy....she says ahh youll have to take that up with Ryan air and we can not offer anything free...Again Ryan air policy is in writingon her phone... but ignored- They also state if you  arrive 3 hours or more later than expected they will refund 250 euro per passenger.... but... and here's the reason why Ryan air lie about the time it takes to get from East midlands to dublin in the first place... we arrive in 30 minutes... as soon as we land the stewardess came on the when we touched down and said our arrival time was 00.10 - now this is important as its only 3 hours if we arrived at 00.25 - we then sat on the plane for a further 20 minutes before departing at 00.40 - so all in all 4 hours and 20 minutes after we should of left - very clever and ignorant from ryan air - we missed our transfer home as our minibus had another job and we had to pay for taxis - ryan air policy states all these policies but doesn't actually follow through with any.. I understand its a little cheaper than other airlines but we didn't realise that commen decency was not included in the price. My tip would be pay the extra and fly with an airline that actually cares about passenger's... im just grateful that nobody was seriously hurt from their lack of care for us all.

During my disembarkation from the plane i said to the flight attendant that they are unbelievable and this will be reported.

Delayed flight times: Departed DUB 22:35 – Arrived EMA 23:30 

Our Ryanair flight was delayed by 3.5 hours. The Ryanair app was insufficient because the gate was changed and despite constantly refreshing the page, and being signed into the airport WiFi, it was just buffering. A woman approached me, a fellow passenger, and asked if I was going to EMA and I said yes, and she informed me of the gate number. I told her the app wasn’t working and she said hers did that too and someone told her the number of the gate. After an agonising 3.5-hour wait, Ryanair staff sent us down the stairs, from the gate to the runway, to board the plane but then we were trapped in a locked stairwell for at least 20mins. I was by the locked door, with staff the other side of it who ignored us. It was so hot, no air, and because I’d already spent 6 hours in the airport and I have ADHD, I was majorly overstimulated to the point of meltdown. As there’s seemingly nowhere to go for people with ADHD, autistic people, or just people that need quiet to calm their anxiety. 

Don’t ever send passengers down a locked stairwell and say to move closer together to get more people in and then have us wait whilst people are still getting off the plane we are about to board. Wait until the plane is ready! I began having an anxiety attack in the stairwell; heart racing; overheating; sweating; tears welling up; hands shaking and experiencing a tension headache. I was listening to an EMDR music playlist for the whole 6 hours and doing what I could to regulate my nervous system and alleviate the stress worsened by my ADHD. However, the lack of organisation between the gate and people on the ground, treating us like cattle, sent me over the edge. 

We were finally let outside where we had to wait a further 10 minutes or so, but the relief of being outside made my tears roll and I couldn’t contain them any longer. A member of staff asked if I was ok, and I couldn’t really speak because my brain was so overwhelmed and not functioning properly. The passenger, stood next to me, said to her, “I think this has just made a lot of people very anxious.” Personally, I’m not an anxious flyer, I usually enjoy it but I couldn’t get my words out so I just said, ‘it’s being trapped’ and the staff member said, “aw, you should’ve said I would have opened the door for you.”. Who would I have asked??? There were no staff on the stairwell and the cabin crew in front of the doors all had their backs to us and even when the looked at us they didn’t acknowledge us at all. The staff member then said, “are you travelling together?” to me and the woman next to me and struggling to speak I said, “I’m alone” and she said, “well it won’t be long now.”  

Then I boarded the plane, and no-one checked my boarding pass, even though I had it ready and held it out with my passport to be checked. They let me walk down from the front to row 28 to discover for myself that my assigned seat didn’t exist because the aircraft had been changed from the original flight. This could’ve been avoided if tickets were checked at the door, especially as the cabin crew knew the aircraft was different to the original one for the flight. I had to move around from seat to seat, like a pinball in an aeroplane-shaped pin ball machine; hot, sweaty, fatigued and overstimulated, moving my luggage around with me in the tight cabin until finally I got a spare seat, and I quietly cried the whole flight home. 

Then once I finally got home to Nottingham, I received a text from Ryanair at 23:53 apologising for the delay and giving me a complimentary €4 to spend at selected airport food vendors at Dublin airport. Too little, too late. I then saw an email that was sent at 21:02 offering passengers the option to swap to a different Ryanair flight, to a different part of England. What a useless offer, by the time I got to the nearest airport to EMA, which would be Birmingham, and then had to pay for another means of travel to Nottingham it would cost me more and get me there around the same time as waiting for my delayed flight to EMA. 

Budget travel should not mean negligent travel. As a communications specialist who’s worked in different sectors, including travel management, working with travel suppliers and customers. I’ve dealt with social media complaints and customer complaints and I’m very aware of the factors that can impact and delay travel. However, the key to minimising the damage of any unforeseen problem, such as a long delay, is communication. Keeping the customers in the loop about the status of the issue, giving time frames where possible and ensuring that customers’ well-being is a priority. As the email I’ve received today from Ryanair states: ‘No matter how hard we prepare, unpredictable challenges such as Air Traffic Control, weather and technical issues lead delays beyond our control.’ I completely agree, however, other airlines at least have the bare minimum customer communications and customer service in these circumstances, which Ryanair failed miserably to provide. I want a refund, not €4 in an airport that I can’t spend. Worst travel experience of my life. Please, please, please, think of your duty of care to your passengers! Serious changes to your ways of working are needed!"

I would not say any of their fees are hidden. As someone who always fly’s with Ryanair, I know what to expect. If you want luxury and a lot of comfort then Ryanair are not for you, but for me to travel to a very popular Spanish destination with luggage and seat selection for £250 return in the peak of Summer (next cheapest EasyJet wanted £400!) I cannot complain.

I was lucky to be on the MAX both flights so the planes were new and modern and had better legroom, but I’ve never had an issue with Ryanair and I will continue to use them. They do what they say on the tin, get you from A to B safely at a low price. I go onto Ryanair not expecting much, and if you have low expectations which for an ultra low cost carrier, you really should not expect high level service, then you will have no issues with Ryanair.

With that said, both sets of crew I had, both based out of Alicante, were very friendly and happy to serve. It’s not the high level service you’d get on main airlines but what do you expect when you pay a fraction of the price? Ryanair do the job well, you get what you pay for! Personally for a 2 hour hop over to Spain, I’m not interested in high level service, I just want to get to my destination safely at the lowest price and Ryanair do this very well!

Previously ignored since my initial email sent 05/05/2023 from my poor transfer experience on 27/04/2023 booked via Ryanair. Please see below the initial email sent & respond before escalating. I am emailing regarding the terrible service received from our transfer, 1) pickup from barcelona airport was a meet & greet service with the flight number given for the driver to be aware of any delays. After collecting our luggage, no one was there to meet & greet us. Bear in mind we had 7 persons including two elderly standing waiting for 15 minutes until his arrival, not forgetting my children standing in the immediate hot temperatures. The driver also appeared very surprised there was 7 persons to collect with luggage. 2)pickup from park playa bara was scheduled for 1530hrs, again waiting in the intense heat with no sign of the driver at 1540hrs (remember we were early to ensure no delays to make our flight) we called him & he confirmed he would be 5 minutes. A photograph of his location came through (see attached) where i had to call again to confirm our location, the language barrier did not help to explain our location. I stood at the park entrance looking out for the vehicle registration as given (7679KHI) but a driver arrived at 1547hrs (again see attached photograph) that did not match the vehicle to collect us, without the drivers confirmation we would never have known this was our vehicle when he finally arrived! I dread to think if this was my parents on their own, not forgetting the unnecessary anxiety from my father in law thinking they will miss the flight! I want an immediate response for compensation of my €273 as this is by far not a service that Ryanair should be promoting, especially if its an “approved” 3rd party.

你們公司的線上登機系統做的很差，我們一行人四人兩個大人兩個小孩要從布達佩斯搭機到愛丁堡，想要線上預登記根本無法進行，可能的原因是因為系統顯示隨行的人員有16歲以下的乘客無法進行線上預登記，然後接下來怎麼輸入都行不通。好，重點來了，若無法完成線上的登機作業，在櫃檯前一個人要被多收取56歐元的費用，也就是我們一行人要多被收224歐元，相當於多被收取7840元新台幣，這太不合理。因為我們現場有出示無法完成預登記的紀錄，線上登機系統的問題不是乘客的責任，現場地勤人員也只能兩手一攤不關她的事，要坐上飛機就得再付224歐元，不然之前的機票錢也都白費，這太不合理，且在機場也無溝通管道，航空公司電話也沒人接，完全的零服務，不知這是否就是所謂的「廉價航班」，但這次可是一點都不廉價，太糟糕的經歷。"

I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding my recent experience on Flight No. FR9773 from Baden Baden to London Stansted on the aforementioned date and time. During the flight, I encountered a highly concerning situation where I was left stranded in the aisle without access to my assigned seat. The stewardesses were occupied with serving all passengers on the flight , leaving me standing for 30 minutes and as a result, I faced inconvenience and discomfort due to this unattended situation. Additionally, I must express my deep disappointment with the behavior exhibited by the staff on board. Not only were they uncooperative and discourteous, but they also engaged in inappropriate and offensive language, which is unacceptable from a professional standpoint. As I didnt want to create a scene, I waited and didnt engage in this unprofessional behaviour. Photos were taken Such an experience has left me distressed and concerned, as it reflects poorly on your esteemed company's reputation and commitment to providing satisfactory service to your customers. I kindly request a formal reply from your end to address these grievances promptly and appropriately. I believe that addressing these issues will help prevent similar incidents in the future and contribute to the enhancement of overall customer experience.

Well I have never felt far from it all because of Ryanair and the absolutely abysmal service they have provided on BOTH flights I took with them. I have been left thinking that I will stick to my covid style “staycations” in the UK because Ryanair has genuinely put me off of international flying forever. I wouldn’t mind as much if I had paid a “Low fare, Ryanair” style prices but because of the school holidays I paid some serious money for my flights. So I’ll start with the outbound journey. We arrived at Stansted airport well over two hours before our scheduled departure to put in our 10kg hand luggage bag (which Ryanair already charged a fortune for). There was a huge queue at the luggage desk which took approximately 40 minutes to navigate. I got to the front with my partner, waiting to be called next and then the panic ensued. A Ryanair conveyor belt generated a little smoke which I could see from where I was stood, nothing major I thought. Well anyone would think world war three was taking place. The fire alarm sounds, a male Ryanair employee is frantically yelling down his radio and waving his hands around from the elevated section above the baggage check in desks, followed by a female Ryanair customer agent running through the crowd, looking panicked and distressed whilst the fire alarm sounds, “EVACUATE! EVACUATE!” “WE NEED TO EVACUATE RIGHT NOW!” she bellowed as she ran out before anyone else, unhooking the temporary lines in a panic and allowing them to recoil uncontrollably. Passengers casually loitered towards the exit door, which was chocker block with people trying to leave. There simply wasn’t enough exits for the amount of passengers Ryanair had queuing. Anyway, we evacuate for just under an hour before rejoining the chaos which was the Ryanair luggage check in queue for the second time. People went running back in, there was no order or control by staff. It was a right free for all. Meanwhile my partner and I queue again and notice some female Ryanair crew memebers are now on the elevated area above the check in desks taking selfies whilst I’m panicking that I’m going to miss my flight because the check in desks are half staffed (my flight was less than an hour away from departing at this point, I still needed to check in my luggage, go through airport security and find my gate). There was absolutely no organisation to ensure the passengers catching the closest departing flights had their luggage checked in first, it really was terrible. I finally make it to the flight just in time and ask the female gate agent for Ryanair who was aware of the airport evacuation following the Ryanair conveyor belt smoking “What happens if customers don’t make it in time, will you be holding the plane?” I was told “It’s not a Ryanair problem”, Wow I thought just wow!  I then boarded the plane, taking my narrow, legroomless seat next to the toilet to be told we were now delayed for an hour having missed an Air Traffic Control slot, fantastic! I’ve got to sit here for four hours now breathing in the stench of the toilet, absolutely fantastic. I got to Kefalonia and had a fantastic holiday, putting the delays behind me. A week later I returned for my home bound flight, and what a surprise another Ryanair DELAY! This time the aircraft was delayed arriving into Kefalonia to collect us and return us to Stansted. My partner and I sit in a heavily over crowded gate area, utilising the hard marble floor as a seat whilst we waited ages for information. I knew what was going on through Stansted departure screens and Kefalonia arrivals screens. At 1930 (our departure time) we were informed by tannoy that the aircraft was delayed.  The gate eventually opened at around 1950 and people rushed towards the gate. I purchased a priority boarding ticket and had to join the melee of confusion and people argued over who was and was not a priority boarder, it was really uncomfortable! There was no order or control with regards to queueing. Anyway I eventually got to the front of the “Not so priority boarding queue” and headed down towards the plane, to then spend the next twenty minutes queueing on the tarmac behind screaming children in the blistering heat whilst Ryanair were still disembarking the aircraft after its late arrival from Stansted. Eventually we board, approximately an hour late at this point, everyone takes their seat as and the doors close, I’m finally excited to be heading home ready for my working day that will start in less than 12 hours from now….. Nope! Captain comes over the tannoy, apologises for the delay before apologising for the additional delay of one hour that we would now experience because of over crowded airspace. As I right this review I still sit here on the tarmac, still delayed at Kefalonia, still not knowing when I’ll ever get home. So to conclude my experience overall was an absolute disaster!

These seats were situated in-front of the emergency exit in the middle of the Boeing 737-800 aircraft. I am convinced that these seats were not even meant to be seats, there were no air vents or flight attendant button situated above them and the seat pitch was notably less than other rows. They have also moved the toilets from the isle at the back of the aircraft and put them in the gully where the tea and coffee facilities are. There was next to no room to wait in line for the toilet as the crew sat in there while on break. There are two toilets rammed into 1, I have seen wardrobes with more space inside. This is obviously to cram yet MORE seats into the aircraft. I know you get what you pay for but you still expect to reasonably comfortable and not packed into the aircraft like sardines in a can.

We were on a milestone wedding anniversary trip. There is one flight 4X weekly from Birmingham to Knock in Western Ireland departing at 7:05 am. Because of the early Monday morning flight, we chose to travel to Birmingham him airport the night before our scheduled 7:05 flight 665 and stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn located easy walking to the airport (HGI was nice by the way). Birmingham airport is a train wreck. We arrived at about 4:45am and got hung up in a ridiculous security check. 
We got to the gate at about 6:40am and saw the door closing as we arrived. We explained the ridiculously slow security and the Ryan employees working the gate seem to revel in our unfortunate circumstance. What happened next was truly unbelievable. First, the attendants let one traveler in saying that they knew him him. Second, and even worse, flight 665 was delayed. It just sat there without moving for about 50 minutes or so. The flight was delayed further as they slowly took our checked bags off the airplane. There were about 36 open seats.
Since the next flight to Knock was two days later, we then were booked on another Ryanair to Dublin (not Knock) at 6 pm on Monday evening, getting charged 200 euros for the flight change. 
Instead of spending our wedding anniversary at a lovely resort in Western Ireland called Mt Falcon (wonderful place by the way), we spent it at the Birmingham Airport. No, the story does not end there. The Dublin flight was 3 1/2 hours late, departing at about 9:40 pm. it cost 485 eros for the 3-hour drive from Dublin to Mt. Falcon in western Ireland. We arrived on Tuesday morning at about 2:30 am on Tuesday morning, having already paid for Monday. It is not my nature to write this kind of review. In this instance, I do believe people should be aware of Ryanair's callous nature in dealing with air travelers. I am not making over embellishing the story in any manner.

I then tried to call the Ryanair customer service helpline to which no one could provide any useful information, they just told me to submit a claim to claim back the total cost of the bag and were requesting receipts of all the items in the bag. Who keeps receipts to clothes and personal belongings, and if you do, do you have access to these while you are on holiday? There wasn't even a process for locating the missing luggage, just claim the cost of the bag so they don't have to go looking for it and return it to you. It's almost as if Ryanair do this on purpose so they can compensate you at far less the value of the bag. The best part was there was an AirTag in my bag, so I new the exact location which showed me that the bag never made it out of Edinburgh Airport. Staff over the phone were incompetent and were unable to provide any useful assistance, and email replies took over a week in-between, if at all. It wasn't until I returned home to Australia after my 5 week holiday in Europe that I saw via the AirTag that the bag had finally moved out of the blackhole that is Edinburgh Airport to Heathrow, then finally made it's way back home. It wasn't until the 25th OF JULY that I received an email from the lost baggage team at Melbourne Airport informing me that the bag had arrived, that I received any contact from anyone regarding the missed luggage. Despite someone obviously organising onto several flights (Edinburgh-London, London-Singapore, Singapore-Sydney, Sydney-Melbourne) I did not receive any updates whatsoever from Ryanair on the progress of having the bag returned to me.

On several occasions, I have spent in total 7 hours travelling from Edinburgh to Dublin, a flight which should take at most 2 hours inclusive of boarding time etc. While I understand that most flight delays are not any one airline's fault but a result of high air traffic and high number of passengers, Ryanair makes no attempt to manage these delays (which are expected at this point) and simply expects passengers to navigate constant changes and delays themselves. The result is an extremely tiring, frustrating, and painful experience. I personally would never recommend Ryanair – unless there is no other option."

1) You have to check in online two hours before departure.  No good turning up at the airport two hours before departure. They'll charge you £80 to check in.  There is NOTHING in the many web-pages through the booking process that mentions this little fact.  Its designed to trip you up and strip money off you.
2) You can enter: date, departure town, destination.. and begin a booking.. I want to fly from RZE to LTN on X date. But halfway through clicking 'no' to evade all the extras: seating, baggage, insurance, etc, it CHANGES the departure town.  So unless you check and re-check the basic flight description on each and every page, you land up with a ticket from the wrong town. Its designed and set up to trip you up and strip money off you.

Only at the end when she saw my despair and the person who was with me in tears did she say that it had already been given (after 6 attempts) and let us go to the plane.  All this behavior is completely out of line and an unspeakable abuse of power.

What should have been a straightforward flight turned into a distressing ordeal that revealed the worst of this company's practices.

Upon arriving at the airport, I was informed that my flight was delayed by a staggering 2 hours, without any valid explanation or updates. This lack of transparency and disregard for passengers' time set the tone for the rest of the disastrous journey.

To my dismay, I found myself a victim of racial profiling by Ryanair staff. I was subjected to undue scrutiny and unfair treatment simply because of my appearance, an experience that was humiliating and degrading. To make matters worse, I was threatened with the possibility of being denied access to the aircraft based on nothing more than their prejudiced assumptions.

Seeking recourse, I decided to contact Ryanair's customer service department after the incident. However, instead of addressing my legitimate concerns, I was met with hostility and denial. Shockingly, they accused me of making false allegations, dismissing the racism I endured as insignificant. Not only did I not receive any form of apology, but I was made to feel as though I was the one at fault for speaking up against such unacceptable behaviour.

It is essential to note that my past experiences with Ryanair in cities like Milan, London, and Budapest were relatively positive. However, the Alicante staff's behaviour tarnished the airline's reputation significantly. Discrimination is a serious issue that continues to plague societies worldwide, and for Ryanair's customer service to trivialize such claims is deeply disturbing.

The fact that Ryanair's customer service chose to dismiss my valid concerns, despite the alarming prevalence of racism across Europe and the world, is nothing short of disgusting. It highlights a lack of accountability and a failure to take responsibility for the actions of their staff.

In conclusion, my experience with Ryanair in Alicante was an absolute nightmare. The delayed flight, racial profiling, and appalling customer service have left me with a profound sense of disappointment and outrage. I implore Ryanair to address these issues seriously and ensure that their staff receives proper training to prevent such distressing incidents from happening again in the future."

Conveyor belt at Bournemouth not working so long queues to checkin and thereafter to drop off hold baggage. This meant a delay of more than an hour setting off.
Coming back the Ryanair site would not allow me to checkin online so went to the airport early to sort and not lose my seat. Queued only to be told by checkin that I needed to queue at another desk and then comeback. By now the only seats available were centre seats so took one of those and had to pay appx ten euros for not having checked in online (which of course despite a few hours trying) I could not do.
Went back to the checkin desk (more queuing) to get my seat and luggage sorted and was told another seat was free but I would need to pay another 28 euros and as it was centre aisle I took that option.
I should say that staff at Malta were nothing but helpful and friendly.
Then the fun really began. It became obvious the flight would be delayed, first by and hour then two and then more than 3. 7pm soon became 10.10pm or thereabouts I didn't make an exact note. No apologies etc and we all boarded. Unfortunately my seat was next to two larger than average which bit into my space significantly.
Other passengers received notice they could claim compensation for the delay which Ryanair had told them was down to them not having sufficient staff.
The plane was literally slammed onto the runway in the early hours, not good for my daughter who had been waiting over 3 hours, and eventually I returned home to West Sussex.
As to compensation I received a very short note from Ryanair simply telling me that had the plane had arrived a few minutes before a total 3 hour delay no compo was due.

After landing in Limoges I rung my mum back in the uk and asked if she could do anything and go check. She travelled from skipton to Leeds and when she first got there she said no one was accommodating and it wasn’t in lost and found. As this point I’m very stressed and upset as I have now lost a £600 iPad! Later on my mum rung and said she was going back up because she managed to log onto find my iPhone and see that the iPad was still where I left it. On her 2nd attempt of travelling to leeds from skipton she said there was a young blond lad about 16 years old working at the airport who simply took the time to take 5 minuets and help.

Not seen this approach at any of their airports before. Queue said 7 mins to clear security. It was 25mins. We arrived at the gate 20 mins before flight departure time because of this. Ryanair staff were still at the departure gate but turning people away in front of us because we weren’t there 30 mins or more.  We explained the security delay.  She refused us entry it out bothering to make eye contact etc. Instead, she took delight in stating that they’d now have to retrieve our checked in bags from the hold - without telling us where they’d be.  Am ex-airline and know this exercise is more time consuming than pressing a button to let us board the flight, especially as the staff were still at the gate and the aircraft was right outside with boarding still ongoing.   We had an 8 year old and 10 year old with us. We had to watch our plane sitting on the tarmac with the doors all open for another 10 minutes.  It didn’t concern her one bit even though there wasn’t another flight to Rodez for another 2 days.  They had done the same thing to a non English French family in front of us.  We eventually found our bags after going round Dublin airport arrivals and then had to start over again.  Ryanair then told us it was a bargain for us to buy seats on any flight going anywhere in France for a special price of 400 Euros. When I pointed out they were selling them for less on their website, they said that with bags, it was a good deal.  We took it as we had travelled 100 miles from Belfast and so couldn’t easily go home.  Our new flight was then delayed an hour with incorrect gate numbers being displayed etc. the upshot being we didn’t arrive in Marseille airport until midnight.  God only knows how non English speaking passengers worked out where to board at all. This delay meant our car hire office had closed and didn’t reopen until the next day. All airport hotels were full and so we had to sleep on the airport floor with nothing but one towel for the young children. 
Ryanair can hide behind its skeleton staff operating model, you get what you pay for etc. all they want, but this was fundamentally a case of getting a rude member of staff with evident contempt for passengers. More than one subsequent airport employee also made this observation when we relayed what had happened. Human decency is FREE Ryanair. The car hire cost to go one way from Marseille airport back to Rodez was 360euros. It took 4 hours.  800 Euros and 24 hours later because of their Dublin gate operating model, no bargain I can tell you.

Flight was delayed but that had people go through the gate only to spend over 1/2 hour either standing in the hot bus or sitting on the stairs while, allegedly they deplaned some disabled people - if that was they case, they should not have started the boarding. Then sat in the plane for 1 hour waiting for a new slot to fly. And then tried to encourage everyone to pay 1 EUR to participate in some ridiculous lottery.

But the worst was discovering at the check-in that it needed to be done online. When they told us we needed to pay 55 EUR per ticket, I started to do the online check-in there at the counter. But they told me that I was too late. I discovered later reading the conditions that it was not too late. I would have done the online check-in if I had known it was required. I received two emails 24 hours before the flight - the first was about downloading the Ryanair app and the second had """"IMPORTANT"""" in the subject line so I focused on that one - it indicated that when flying out of Tel Aviv with foreign passports, we would have to do a physical check-in and so I ignored the earlier email encouraging me to do an online check-in. When I went back after the fact and looked at that first email, the 55 EUR penalty was specified at the very bottom of the email - you needed to scroll down past the recommendation to use the Ryanair app.

I contacted customer support to get a refund. They were useless. Obviously they are covered legally and so there is no power to the customer. It is very clear that their practice is deliberately deceptive.

Companies like this should not be permitted to operate. In the end, I paid the same price as I would have for another carrier with better airport facilities and proven customer-orientated practices.

She did state that the turnaround was which on these flights was quick, and once I boarded I understood why! The plane was absolutely disgusting.  Got to our seats and literally caped with broken crisps and then had to use our feet to clear away all the sweets and rubbish that lay in our foot well. Now if this was a 40 minute flight to Belfast, I may not have been as fussed but a 2 1/2 flight to Malaga means I want a little bit of comfort at least. I didn't really want to put my backpack down due to the food on the floor. Does it really take that much to clean down the plane quickly, even if just the worst of it? Upon landing and walking up the plane, even more litter was deposited from our flight and was shocked to see people literally queuing to come on board for the next flight. I did feel sorry for them knowing what they were getting on board to. 
Also, and this may be down to winds or what I don't know, but I have never felt such a heavy landing as when we arrived in Malaga. The pilot absolutely slammed the plane down to the point it sounded like an explosion had gone off. Yes as stated it could have been to some unknown factor but it really wasn't pleasant. Would have gotten one star but a star was added due to the flight home being a lot cleaner on the plane."

We only had our original e-mail from when we booked 4 months ago where this was mentioned in a side note. It cost us 3000 SEK to check in at the airport. There was a long line of passengers ahead and behind us who had the same problem.
* Bags allowed weren't very clear. When booking it seemed like only a personal item was allowed, like a laptop bag, not a backpack where you could fit anything. So we paid extra for cabin luggage. Which turned out to be checked in luggage that we had paid extra for. When entering the plane there was no check at all of the size or weight of our backpacks. Money our the window.
* On the return we did check in online, but apparently boarding passes needs to be printed, at least according to the information. So we had to make some hassle at the Hotel in order to get those printed. At the check-in it seemed to be fine using your phone though.

All in all it seems the system is designed for you to misunderstand and pay extra fees for something you don't need. Not flattering at all.

There is nowhere to sit at StanSted airport, and Ryanair seems to mostly operate from there. The flights look cheap online and it all seems so shocking to see that price compared to other airlines. You then realize that you need to pay for either a 10kg cabin luggage, or 10kg hold luggage. The difference in the amount automatically makes you want to choose cabin luggage. By the time all the hidden costs that they don't advertise well enough are exposed, you end up paying the same price or more to get a standard flight from a more expensive airline, or you end up having to suffer the loss and go with 1/4 of your soul to your destination. Get to the airport, only to find out that check-in for people with visa checks opens a lot later than for people who don't need it. You also see it tells you only 100ml liquid bottles are allowed in a 20*20cm zip bag. What they don't show all over the airport with this, is how many bottles are allowed, how many bags are allowed, and is it a total of 100ml liquids or 1 bottle each 100ml. You spend a long time waiting in queues because only one lady is handling visa inspection. Finally, when you hit security it is an absolute disaster as I was only allowed 1 20*20cm clear plastic bag with liquids and had to end up throwing all the items away (which I feel gets used by other people and not thrown away). It was such an anxiety-provoking experience when I got to security. Super busy, people just telling you what to do with attitude. Then you have to part with 3/4 of your should because you can't afford to stand in a queue and wait to discuss with the other Ryanair staff if they can post your liquids back to your house; plus with the price to pay for this postage, you may as well just buy new liquid supplies. I lost a lot of money today because it was poorly mentioned as to how many 100ml bottles you can take etc. I was very upset after my security gate experience. It was traumatizing. People telling you off, rushing you, then having to chuck expensive items away. I am not rich, that is why I booked Ryanair, but they hide all these costs and charge so much for you to have standard benefits. I am going to try my hardest to never use Ryanair again, even if it means breaking the bank.

Since my last Ryanair review to Dublin, I'd flown them again, this time to Santiago de Compostela in Spain (check out my Hotel Gelmirez review, too!) And I once again had the absolute privilege of flying Ryanair!

So, we got to Stansted and proceeded through the airport as per usual and we soon made our way to the gate. It's worth pointing out that Ryanair use gates at Stansted that are a good 10 minute walk from the shopping area, so allow a bit of time for that.

Anyway, we soon made it to our gate and were funneled down the corridor to the apron (no jetbridges here!) We had to wait about 15 minutes in this hot, claustrophobic 7ft wide corridor before people had actually finished deboarding from the flight that had just arrived.

Anyway, we were soon on-board EI-EKT, a 13 year-old 737-800, sitting in row 26. I would thoroughly recommend row 26 to anyone, by the way, as it has the best-aligned window on the plane.

The seat itself though wasn't so recommendable. The window shade didn't come all the way down as it had been bent out of shape, there was a small area of wallpaper that had been glued on above the window, the tray table sounded like a door from Minecraft and the armrest looked like someone had taken a bite out of it.

All that aside, we were soon airborne out of Stansted and we were treated to a lovely sunset over northern France.

I ordered a cheese and ham croissant, too, and it wasn't bad, even if it looked like it had been run over by the catering truck.

The landing was your standard Ryanair fare, a bit unstable on final and fairly hard, but safe enough.

**INWARD LEG**

Although not flight related, Santiago is a lovely city and I definitely recommend having a visit. The Cathedral near enough blew me away, it's just stunning! Ryanair and Vueling fly there from London, so go there if you get the chance!

Santiago's Airport is your standard small European airport, a few gates, a Relay and a bar and not much else really, although everything is in easy walking distance (5 mins tops from one side to the other)

Our ride home soon touched down at Santiago, a 737 MAX 8-200, infamous for its high density configuration.

Again, the same boarding thing of being stuck in the tunnel, but soon enough we were on the apron, then on-board the MAX, 4 years old and registered as EI-HAW.

Ryanair's MAXes feature their newest cabin, with the helpful addition of coathooks on the tray table latch. However, everything feels very cheap and plastic-y, even for Ryanair.

We had 7A, B and C, which while having an absolutely amazing engine view, the legroom is knee-crunching, and the window is not very well aligned, you cannot really look out of it easily, you have to awkwardly crane your neck.

The D, E and F side's window is a bit better aligned, though.

Shortly after, we took off aboard the much quieter MAX and made our way north again.

The flight progressed quickly, although they hadn't loaded any cold drinks on-board due to catering issues, so only hot drinks and food was offered. 

On this leg I tried the pasta bolognese, which for Ryanair airplane food, was actually pretty decent, but at £7 is quite costly.

Soon enough, we landed at Stansted with a landing that was suspiciously smooth, but, hey!

Because we didn't have 3 bags, but just 2 over 20kg each we got charged again. So paid £44 for extra bag which we didn't have and got charged again £80 for 2 overweight suitcases at the airport. Got told it's the extra weight plane is carrying when baggage is overweight. Now two overweight suitcases with 50kg, are surely lighter, than 3 with 60kg.

Last year, we travelled with EASY JET and everything was smooth. The crew was lovely and helpful. 

This was after 6 years of being unable to travel because our 7 years old  (non verbal) son is autistic and he is hypersensitive ( this means that sounds, smells , textures can make him feel real pain)

He can have an involuntary meltdown (no a tantrum) if is exposed to certain stimuli.

Rayanair :
- delayed at the airport for over  1 hour.
- slow boarding 
- we  were some of the first people on the plane 
- so we had to wait for everyone to get on board.
- once everyone on board the plane was delayed to take off.
- my son needed the toilet so he stood up . The plane wasn’t moving and I saw through the window a queue of planes waiting to take off . 

-The flight attendant asked us rudely to get him in his seat. 

- I explained he has been still for too long and he needed to go to the toilet .

- They shout at us and my son laid down on the airplane floor as he can’t stand people shouting this make him very nervous.

- then my husband was forced to force my son to seat (this caused him pain- distress) 

When we were doing that:

*** the flight attendant said on the microphone that the plane couldn’t take off because of my son.

This caused the anger of some passengers and they attacked us verbally putting my son and my hole family in danger.

- My son probably will never go on plane because this IGNORANT ANIMALS .

My husband almost start a fight and he is a very calm man. 

It was HELL!!! 

My son was crying and that made my Daugther to cry to. 

I know that in this case scenary I have to remain calm for the well-being of my son.

My husband loses it, my 10 years Daugther losed it. 

I couldn’t lose it and they thought I didn’t care for what was happening.

With my son seated by force and us restraining him for about 5- 10 minutes  and me KNOWING that  my son was in Terrible distress. I was at edge. 

- Then  they said we have to wait for other 20 minutes to take off.

I kindly asked if my son could go to the toilet . They said NO. 

- by that moment he was needing to go for over 1 hour. My son couldn’t understand why he wasn’t allowed to go and he though we were not understanding his needs.

Everything would have been ok if they just  allow my son to go to the toilet in first place.  

Finally the plane took off, I took him to the toilet . 10 seconds after he was  a little bit calmer.

I had to get back to use the toilet myself , I was sweeting and nervous and needed water on my face. 

While I was on the toilet they start selling food and the flight assistant has the trolley just in front of me. 

She could just move and let me pass but NO she carried on and I had to wait for 1 hour at the back of the plane until they finish selling the food.

I remained calm and did not say anything to avoid more conflict .

Usually, when my wife and I buy tickets together and check in, our seats are assigned separately, with one in the front and the other in the back of the plane. On the other hand, other companies like Vueling, who also offer free random seating, manage to allocate seats together when tickets are purchased together, which seems more logical and considerate.

7.34045696258545,0.621291875839233,"Stansted Airport Issues",1,"Several concerns I had when travelling with my son with special needs. When I made my booking I had stated that my son required special assistance and assistance to the gate. It gave me an option when booking requesting for this specific support. However, when I got to Stansted airport that morning 3 hours before departure, it was a very different situation. There were several failures which I would like to highlight that resulted in us missing our flight. 

Not only did we miss our flight, we also had to deal with a very rude and abrupt stuff member of Ryanair which displayed absolutely disgusting behaviour. 

What we got to Stansted I went straight to the special assistance desk with my 7-year-old my son whom has ASD and Global developmental delay and my 16-month-old baby. 

When I got to your counter at the special assistance desk, I detailed to the lady that it was my son that needed assistance to the gate. I will not lie to you. I did not find them very friendly or very helpful. They looked at my son top to bottom as he was stood up determining whether or not he needed assistance. I could see the look and judgement on their faces and the way they were looking at him. I then continue to explain that when walking more than 5 minutes he struggles and will throw himself to the floor or will have a lot of pain in his legs. If he tip toes on certain surfaces and I know in airports he really struggles due to sensory overload as well as the pain he feels when tip toeing long distances.
I was told that they would not be able to assist or push my son in the wheelchair as they are not aloud to do so. They told me that I can push him. However, I had a 2-year-old to push myself. So please explain to me how I was given this option but they're not provided it because I had a 2-year-old push in a pushchair. They stated that it was only a 10 minute walk to the gate from security.

I was allocated a lovely lady who did help us through. However, when we got to security it was very difficult, and I was very disturbed and annoyed with the way my son was dealt with. My son had a lanyard around his neck with sunflowers on it, for his autism. As he walk through the barrier it triggered for security to search him. I requested that I take the lanyard off so he could walk through again, as I knew the little metal part was activating the sensor. They told me that this was not possible and this is where we spent a very long time at security. 
My son was then pulled aside and asked to raise his arm continuously by a security member to the point where my son does not understand but he was repeatedly being asked to pick his arms up. After several times off this happening I had to step in and tell the officer that my son does not understand. The officer shook his head and continued to do the same thing again. I don't understand why your security team was not aware of low functioning autism and global developmental delay. My son is nonverbal and does not even understand basic instructions, let alone a full-on search that was conducted on him. Security will requesting for him to do things continuously when he does not understand. This was very very difficult and upsetting for me to watch. I have travelled several times with my son and this is the first time I felt so hurt with the way he was treated. My son was then requested to take off his shoes and socks which he did do, but this was very difficult to manage once again. I don't think your team is aware that autistic people do not like to be touched, however, he was physically checked all over. I understand fully that you have to be security protected but my son cannot even tell you what he's full name is let alone do anything to cause any harm to anybody. This was incredibly difficult as I had an under 2-year-old in the pushchair at the same time that I had to manage. 

Once we came out of security which was incredibly stressful and hard for me and my children. We were take it to the end and told that it will be 10 minutes from there which was incorrect. I check the screen for I gate and at that time it said 59 and then the gate changed again and went back to 59. During this walk to get 59, my son had stopped three times and threw a full-on tantrum. This was because of the overload of sensory that he had to deal with as well as the very long walk. 

I do admit that we made it to the gate very late. However this was not our fault and that walk was most definitely not a 10 minute walk for an autistic child who tip toes. It took us a whole 40 minutes to walk from WHSmiths to the gate. It is very misleading as the detail time of walk is 10 minutes but this does not in reality when taking  lifts and walking with a child with special needs, which he was not provided support for to be at the gate. 

We reach the gate 15 minutes prior to departure time and the gates had already been closed. Once I got there was a group of 10+ people who had also missed the flight. 

I was obviously very upset by this time because not only did I have to go through a very stressful security clearance with my son but then the walk was horrendous to the gate. I explained to the lady that was standing there by the name of Carly. She was about 5 foot 5 in and light coloured eyes eyes with brown hair. I was very upset and told her that it was unfair that there was no support and that we had missed our flight because we were told it was 10 minute walk for. It's not,not with an autistic child. And that I was so disappointed. She looked at me rolling her eyes, saying that there was nothing that she can do. I asked her how is it possible that you can leave this many people and depart and not make an announcement. She said as a response that I should have been there three hours before. I told her I was there three hours before not that she had asked me and that she had assumed that I had just come through. With very patronising responses I told her that I refuse to speak to her and I was going to speak to her colleague. This was an older AfroCaribbean gentleman seemed to be in his 40s 50s. As I was talking to this very kind gentlemen who was speaking to me in a very good tone and manner Carly came and stood besides us to and started whispering,  """"should have turned up on time then. It's not our problem"""". Patronising me from a distance. Whilst I was talking to the gentleman. I turned around to her and asked her why is that she was patronising me and I have a question and that she stopped talking to me because she was trying to rattle me to get a response which I was not providing to her. Carly then walked over to the gentleman that I was talking to and told him to stop talking to me. He looked very confused as he and I were having a very calm conversation. 

I did tell tell her that I am going to report her for her behaviour and her disgusting patronising responses. 

Ryanair stuff should understand how stressful it was for me to come through Security and all the other elements when travelling through an airport. Instead your team member stood there and patronised me, disrespected me and belittled me, in front of everybody that was stood there. 

Because she had told everybody not to respond to me, now do I  know where to go and ask where to get my bags and leave the airport. I don't think this is acceptable. I think this is absolutely disgusting behaviour from your staff member. 

Once I eventually made it back out of the airport with my two children and please keep in mind that I had a child was special needs whom was crying when we came out the other end, because he was so stressed out. 

I took a flight out the following day with easyJet and my experience was incredibly different at Gatwick. They also do not take children in a wheelchair however, they did that for him as an exception as I had a child of under 2 years old with me. But Ryanair at Stansted refused to even help or make any exceptions. 

When coming back from Marrakech I took my Ryanair flight and once again My child was special needs was treated like everybody else and left to walk long distances even though it requested for him to be supported through the airport. Ryanair's behaviour towards my special needs Son was absolutely disgusting. I have several trips booked with Ryanair for the rest of the year. I am incredibly worried with how the company treats children with special needs. 

Not only did I have an awful experience with Ryanair, but I also lost out financially because of your staff members not assisting my child with special needs.

Of course, again we received the emotionless treatment of the staff and an extra 200 pounds lighter, we were finally able to leave the pigsty that is London Stansted Airport.

Ryanair takes advantage of the fact people don't own a credit card, and they do this on purpose. It's just a low strategy to make a bit of extra money."

I flew with Ryanair once before and had no trouble however on our flight home Sunday was terrible. The plane we were due to board was late in, so we were half an hour late boarding. Once on the plane the pilot announced there was an issue with an extra bag and that it would be resolved within a few minutes. Two hours later with no updates they announce again that they are finally putting the bags back into the plane and are re fuelling for a quicker route home. Another twenty minutes later we took off. Once landed we had to wait another hour for the coaches to collect us from the plane as there were no tunnels for us. They only opened the front door and we were sat right at the back with young kids who were as hot and uncomfortable as the rest of us. The staff were unbothered and rude, the landing was extremely rough and our bag was battered and missing the band we had round it.

I do believe that most of these bad reviews are a result of being uniformed of their policies ahead of booking.  #1 purchase your luggage package on initial booking. This will save you considerably by doing it then than later and especially at the check in. #2 print boarding pass before arriving at check in as this will save you about 55 Euros if you have them print them apiece. #3  for 9.00 Euros more, pick your seats ahead of time and you get an extra carry on with it and a premium/primary boarding.

The journey itself was already stressful for her, as she was traveling alone by plane. While she didn't encounter any issues on the outbound flight, her return experience with Ryanair was far from pleasant.

Upon returning, the cabin crew informed her that her baggage was protruding by half a wheel. This simple observation led to unnecessary stress and tears for my mother. The crew's response was to either leave her bag behind or pay a hefty fee of £50. Despite the intervention of other passengers, the crew showed no intention of offering any assistance or support.

It's important to note that my mother's bag didn't even weigh 10kg, and her purse was exceptionally light. The situation was clearly blown out of proportion, causing unnecessary distress to a senior passenger who was already anxious about the journey.

As someone who values customer service and understands the importance of empathy, I was deeply disappointed by Ryanair's handling of this situation. The crew's lack of compassion and unwillingness to find a reasonable solution tarnished the overall experience. It is disheartening to witness such a disregard for the well-being and comfort of passengers, especially when dealing with elderly individuals.

While I understand that airlines have baggage policies in place, it is equally important to exercise flexibility and understanding in certain circumstances. Instead of immediately resorting to penalties, the crew could have offered assistance in rearranging items within the bag or provided a temporary solution to address the slight protrusion issue.

This incident has left a lasting negative impression, not only on my mother but also on our perception of Ryanair as an airline. I hope that this review serves as constructive feedback for the airline to reevaluate their customer service protocols and train their staff to handle similar situations with more compassion and flexibility.

In conclusion, I would advise passengers to consider the potential lack of understanding and assistance from Ryanair's cabin crew when making travel arrangements. There are other airlines available that prioritize customer satisfaction and exhibit a greater level of empathy towards their passengers"

But when we landed there was no sign of any Ryanair attendants to look after passengers until a good 35 mins after was told that they had 70 hotel room only and transport had been arranged but when asked they new nothing about transport or even where the hotel rooms was yet then we found out that they had got us on the flight in the morning and wanted us at the airport by 4am and at this point it was already near 1am so we spent night in airport as by the time they had it organised it would of been time to come back again this is not how I had my whole day of my birthday and let alone the first night of our honeymoon on an airport floor . So we got in the queue just before 4am and there was another flight checking in and when we spoke to a Ryanair representative she new nothing about the flight we was on going out first thing so again we had to go through check in and security and boarding gates and boarded plane took off to Madeira got to Madeira and was told by captain that we were circling waiting for a spot and we was going to land in Madeira so people on the plane applauded, then 15 mins later he said we can’t land in Madeira and we going back to Lisbon with no apologies for his false information when we got back to Lisbon they left doors closed for a while and we see a tanker refuelling the plane no word from captain to say what was happening. At this point people was very upset with how we have been treated as we wasn’t even told anything or even offered a free drink or food at this point and people were starving when I asked the steward I said so if we back to Madeira and we cannot land what are you going to do and he couldn’t give me a actual answer at this point my wife was that distressed as was I as well as other passengers so they all got of the flight as they didn’t mention when they would try again but they did say that if we had to stay in Lisbon then Ryanair wouldn’t supply hotels to people and we would have to spend another night in the airport so that’s why we and lots of other passengers decided best thing to do was just get a flight back to the uk I don’t know how long this could of gone on like this , we was only there until the 12th of may anyway we was told if we got of the flight then we’re on our own but it always felt like that anyway with Ryanair and we just wasn’t going to mess around anymore with them this was meant to be our honeymoon after we got married on Saturday and was also my birthday on the Monday we flew out so the experience has been completely messed up so what would u have done in the situation we was in . I also had a trip booked in on the Tuesday to see dolphins in the wild cost of £78 which we have lost as well as the cost of hotel in Madeira and now we will have to sacrifice having a honeymoon we was told that we could claim compensation due to plane being delayed by over 3 hours but due to the other problems it should be reviewed and I think this whole ordeal should be looked at by Ryanair so that this doesn’t happen again to anyone"

She spoke to the rep and asked him what she should do, he informed her to book a room at one of the airport hotels, keep the receipts so Ryanair can refund her, After calling around to be told that all the airport hotels were fully booked, she again approached the rep and explained the situation, he said that she should find the nearest hotel with a room and again keep all receipts.
Being quite level headed she told the rep that it would take her ages to find a room and would just stay at the airport, very noble for a single 19 year old girl traveling on her own.
The rep informed her that this was impossible as the airport was closing.

Eventually she found a hotel, which describes itself as about 12kms from the airport, cleared it with the rep and got a taxi from the airport to the hotel, checked in and was glad to see another couple of people that she recognized from the airport, ordered a ham sandwich and a coke and went to bed. The hotel woke her up and arranged for a taxi to take her back to the airport. 

After arriving back in Manchester she set about claiming back her expenses, should be easy you would have thought...........

Receipt 1 - Taxi to hotel, Date 10.12.22 Time pick up 21.03, Drop Off 21.19 Distance 10.02KM Cost 23.4 euros.

Ryanair - Not acceptable as the route is not on the receipt.

Receipt 2- Hotel bill in the form of a credit card sales voucher.

Ryanair - Not acceptable as customers name was not on it (IT WAS) doesn't show what service is provided, could be for anything. Cost 249 euros.

Receipt 3 - Receipt for Ham sandwich and coke on room service at above hotel Cost 17.5 euros.

Ryanair - Approved and paid (even though they wouldn't accept the hotel credit card sale voucher as proof of stay?

Receipt4 - Taxi that the hotel booked back to the airport, Date 11.12.2022 Pick Up 04.35, Drop Off 04.49, Distance 10.6KM Cost 24.8euros.

Ryanair - Not acceptable as the route is not on the receipt.

So here we are now in June 2023 and all she has received is the 17.5 euros """"authorized for your reimbursement (food) in full and final settlement of your claim and in accordance with Article 9 of EU Regulation 261/2004.""""

Ryanair like quoting this Article 9 with reference to flight delays, they obviously don't or don't want to understand it, check it out, it takes 30 seconds to read, it's real title is """"Article 9 Right Of Care""""

Now getting quite annoyed with Ryanair, so on behalf of my daughter contacted one of the taxi companies who stated they don't normally print out routes on invoices as sometimes they could be pages long. I also contacted  the hotel in Dublin who were very helpful and emailed me a copy of the actual invoice which including all names and address and the words overnight accommodation which she presented to Ryanair, we will call this Receipt 5

Receipt 5 - Invoice from hotel stating that my daughter had paid for overnight accommodation Cost 249 euros.

Ryanair - I regret to advise, that the cost of your accommodation expenses have been deemed excessive therefore cannot be fully covered as a reasonable expense. Due to this reason, we are not in a position to reimburse the whole amount paid for your hotel stay however a reduced amount of the total cost will be reimbursed in due course.
Wait for the Article 9 quote.........
After reviewing your claim, I wish to confirm that an additional bank transfer to the value of 68.73 GBP (equivalent to 80.00 EUR) has been authorized for your reimbursement (hotel) in full and final settlement of your claim and in accordance with Article 9 of EU Regulation 261/2004.

This Christmas  I took the opportunity to fly from my local airport instead of driving to Dublin and took a stopover in Rome on the way. As budget airlines go they are hard to beat and I like to support Irish. Yes there is a walk to the gates and you have to pay for your add ons, seat choice hold luggage etc but they do what they say and their pricing is clear at booking. I wasn't delayed on any of the 4 flights I took with them on this trip to Italy and I find this to generally be the case with them. Personally I like to choose an extra legroom seat,the extra cost is worth it and if I get 1A I'm off the plane minutes after it lands and I'm away. Even with a hold bag in Rome I was on the train to the city very promptly after landing. I'm writing this review now having had a less than ideal experience with a transatlantic carrier which left me questioning how a budget airline can out perform a national airline. Credit where it is due to Ryanair, if they ever make the jump to transatlantic flights they would get my vote. I would definitely recommend just make sure to select what you need and follow their guidelines on baggage size.

First, boarding gate was not even presented until it was the actual time to board which I have never experienced before. When boarding, there is 2 lines “priority boarding” which basically means you bought the bag that is able to go overhead as well as a bag to go undergo the seat (personal item). Not sure what difference this made. Next, we board the plane and oh my… this is where the horror begins. I look at the seats and they are visibly dirty with the headrest looking oily and seats filled with food crumbs and who knows what else. I also noticed that the ground is also covered in crumbs; it is quite clear that nothing is being cleaned in between flights. Then I get to my seat and these are the most uncomfortable seats my butt has ever been in. These seats are rock hard and by the end of my 3 hour flight, I was hurting. Now, onto the flight itself. We board the plane fairly on time but as we all settle in, the plane doesn’t even depart until ONE HOUR LATER. We were just sitting on the plane uncomfortable and hot since there was no air coming through. The last thing that I was not a fan of was that any drinks while on the plane cost money?!

""""This event occurred on June 10th, 18:45, FL1735 (Valencia, Spain)
As a 20 year old girl, on my first trip abroad in Spain, accompanied by another girl the same age, I experienced something I wish on no one else. Understandably, we had only stayed in Valencia, Spain for a few days, so one personal bag is all we needed. However, I did carry with me a piece of street art on my back between myself and my backpack. It is a quarter inch in depth and the same width and length as the backpack itself. The only reason I didn't pack it int he bag itself is because I valued this art, and was afraid that the pressure of my luggage would damage the piece. After getting past several bag checks where I saw others be asked to put away their purses, making sure they only have one bag, etc. I took this as a good sign, since I'd known my bag would at least fit in the designated area meant for personal items. Finally as I get to the gate, there's a woman, (tall, long face, blond wavy ponytail) I didn't catch her name. She and I made I made eye contact and immediately I felt ill-intent in her eyes. With a slight language barrier she started to spit commands at me to take off my bag, that I'm only allowed one item. This was confusing to me since no other staff member was as harsh as this one. She left no room for consideration, as she separated me from my friend, and had me wait with little explanation outside of the gate to pay 40 euros for this small piece of cardboard. I admittedly had an anxiety attack, trying to collect myself to speak enough Spanish to make my case. As I was collecting myself, I saw the woman smirk a few times to herself, which I found was very unprofessional. Other staff members seemed as helpless as me next to this woman. During and after the flight, I spoke to several staff members, all agreeing that they would have let me past the gate with my bag. For these reasons, I might ask for a refund on the payment of 40 euros, and if this isn't possible, maybe we could track down the woman that did a poor job sending visitors away from her country. 

I'd like to reiterate that I felt extremely pressured to pay a bag fee, since I was in a new and nerve-racking situation. My bag was in fact able to fit in the personal bag space, and multiple staff members told me that I wouldn't have had to pay this fee if it were them in charge of the situation. It also wasn't made known to me that bag refunds weren't available, I was given no choice but to pay for an unjustified bag.

I truly appreciate the continued consideration of my experience, and I hope that this gets through to someone willing to listen."""""

Couldnt open app. Showed Customs no internet. Showed them original flight intinerary. They need boarding pass. Left wife/son to go through customs. RAN few hundred yards back to checkin. Explained situation to Ryanair staff. They said I have to wait. I told them I am now past the checkin time. The girl said I have to wait. They now had many more people waiting. I told her I cant wait. I am late for my flight. I have my wife and child at customs waiting. It took ANOTHER Ryanair staff who overheard to ask what the situation is. I explained again. They printed the boarding pass and told me flight is on final call. I RAN back to customs. Explained to customs. Thankfully they fast tracked me, met my wife and child and we RAN, through duty free, with perfume reeking shops and my wife and child both suffer alergies easily triggered by such smells. Then we had to RUN for another maybe 10 minutes to finally get to a CLOSED gate. Thankfully they allowed us through. You know those people who are always the last to get on a plane, keeping everyone else waiting. Well, that was us, thanks to Ryanair keeping us waiting so long initially and then printing two instead of 3 boarding passes. Worst of all was the girl who repeatedly told me I would have to again wait despite being late for the flight. The flight itself was fine and the flightcrew were great. My wife had to use her inhaler as she was in a state after having to run so far so quickly. I have complained to Ryanair and have had no response. This speaks volumes!"

I really didn't pay attention as I was quiet tired and feeling more uncomfortable with himself making the lady on the other side stand up so many times so he could go to the back of the plane. 
By the end of the flight, Sara ( the Spanish flight assistant) sat down in front of us and catch my attention her atitude: with her legs crossed and the skirt lowing up and almost showing the ****  ( normally your staff has a very modest attitude). My partner was sitting already near to me because the plane was landing. He has a Samsung folder. He made eye contact with Sara, straighted his arm along the sit in front of us, opened slowly the phone to show her his mobile number. She took her personal mobile phone, copied his number and nodded with her head telling him that was saved. He closed the phone, nodded back and some people that were already up because we had landed, meanwhile, noticed and smiled. 
I told my partner that I noticed what they did straight away and he assumed. 
I understand is not your responsibility the loyalty of the couples but imagine that you may have polices about professional boundaries and this  is completely unacceptable. The flight assistants role aims to create a good flights experience not to humiliate the passengers. 
I asked Sara to speak straight away with her supervisor and she tried to avoid it  saying that she could sort out any issue. I asked a different crew member and I exposed the situation to Alessandro before I left the plane. ( please let me know if you had any incident report regarding this). I didn't feel reassured by Alessandro as he didn't seem to give any value to the incident.

Ryanair argued that 'all the other customers where likely premium"""" when the selected persons complained about the visibly oversized bags of most of the rest of the customers. Then, at the end, after taking the money of some clients, it was perfectly allowed to come into cabin with the backpack because 'it was not large enough and could have been admitted without paying more bevause there was a lot of space'.

When the boarding gates weren't open even 30mins after we were scheduled to board, Ryanair announced a delay of 2h, without any further warning. Two hours later, many people were queueing when Ryanair announced another 1h of delay to board. There were elderly people in the queue, already past the boarding check-in desk, waiting in the exterior staircase with nowhere to sit and in freezing temperatures. We finally boarded, about 4h behind schedule. There were barely any flight assistants on the aircraft and a lot of confusion among passengers. 30 mins later, we were sitting at our seats ON the plane when it was announced that the flight would not depart tonight and was delayed until the next day. It was around 1am, everyone was tired, and no refreshments or any kind of comfort compensation was offered. We were told we could book hotels for the night and come back in the morning, or take taxis back home and we would be reimbursed by Ryanair. I chose to cancel my flight reservation because this delay made me miss too much of a short weekend with friends. I spent 2h on the phone with Ryanair the next day, and no one was able to give me clear instructions for how to get reimbursement and compensation, even though it is my right as a passenger and Ryanair had ensured compensation for all. I tried to submit a compensation form online and the form said I was not allowed to do so as my flight had not been disturbed (excuse me?). I spent all of my phone credit calling flight agents who were rude and did not help me nor have the patience to guide me through the reimbursement and compensation processes. Today, 3 months later, I have just spent over 2h trying to obtain compensation for this flight and still have received the same arrogance and disrespect from Ryanair flight agents. Even after explaining, over and over, that the form does not work for me, I received the same obnoxious and more disrespectful response: """"We cannot help you with this, you have to fill the online form, madam you need to take your time doing it, I cannot stay on the line with you.""""

Ryanair lies and says their """"state of the art"""" system showed the bags were reunited with us 1 day later thus will not pay anything out for the toiletries and basic clothes items we needed to buy because of them, even after proof shown that it was 2 days later they still say it was 1 day. Worst customer service I've ever experience in any industry. 

Firstly I will start this with the simple comment that there are so many airlines out there that avoiding this one is easy and should be avoided whenever possible. So here we go with the full good, bad, ugly and terrible. Good was online booking was easy and for a budget airline the legroom wasn't completely sardined in there, that's about where the good ends. 
When we arrived at the airport and finally found the desk (learned Venice airport is a bit of a mess) the line didn't move for about 45 minutes at all. When it did start moving and we got the desk they were hand writing out baggage tags for 3 different flights. I already felt this was a bad sign. Luckily I caught the check in woman writing down the wrong flight on my tag which would've sent it to Barcelona. So after double checking that it was written to go to Naples on the right flight number off go our bags. Boarding was a bit of a zoo of people, no real decent direction or order of things. Once on the plane we were delayed for about an hour sitting on the tarmac in average comfort seating. Then we leave, nothing of note really on the flight itself as it was a very short flight to Naples. 
Get to Naples and low and behold, both me and my wife's baggage doesn't arrive. We go to the generic desk for filing a lost bags claim (Ryanair pays into a universal company for this which handles many airlines)  and meet with people that really couldn't seem to care less. I get our reference numbers etc and off we go into Naples (this is now about noon). We only had minor items with us in our carry on, but our clothing, majority of toiletries and most other things beyond valuables were in the checked bags. The first evening we bought only some toiletries items in hopes we would hear things in the morning. Next day nothing and after the 24 hr mark we do some basic shopping as delayed bags allow after 24 hrs to be reimbursed for basic items. We both get some basics, underwear, socks, shorts, a couple shirts, certainly nothing out of reasonable. Day 2 later in the afternoon they advise the bags were located but they won't be delivered out to our accommodation until the following day. Ok fine we got enough items to get through till the next day so we don't buy anything more. The next day we are informed 2pm the delivery will come. Ok so we figure lets go out for the morning and just in case we set up to be at the room for 12-1230 pm. Suddenly at 11am we get a call from the delivery person, who was immediately rude we weren't there waiting for him even though its several hours before they were supposed to be there. They end up leaving the bags at the door, unattended, luckily they didn't get stolen by some passerby and I was able to get a hold of the BNB host who collected them and put them in the room. When we get back we realize how lucky we also are that we use a protective cover on our baggage as the cover looked like it was attacked by a badger, dragged through the dirt and kicked a few times showing this bag was clearly not handled with any degree of care but I guess that comes with flying as most can speak to with baggage handling. 
Fast forward to after we finish the trip and make a claim for delayed baggage. Start the claim, forward the receipts and details of lost on April 4th and reunited with the bags April 6th.

Anyone who harks back to the days when airline travel was something to look forward to, especially on budget carries is gone.  If anything, my experience is that jet2 makes a reasonable effort from the carrier's perspective. That said, Ryanair FR1957 was a kind of newish 737 MAX, was quiet, good service crew and as a tip, try to get seats 2a (no seat in front (1a) and not in the door marshalling area for the loo) or 2d- 2f on the front bulkhead.

Unfortunately, we have learned our lesson to rather not book with Ryanair anymore. Our trip back from Dublin to Amsterdam was a disaster to call it nicely. We have arrived at the gate 2.5 h before our flight. As shown on the board we went to gate 104 but as all seats were taken we sat down on the opposite site (106). Meanwhile unannounced by Ryanair the gate changed to 102 which was not in our sight anymore. Us thinking it is still gate 104 we watched and waited till people were queuing for boarding. At 6.25pm (flight was at 6.55pm, outbound flight was delay as well) by coincidence we found out that the gate moved to 102 and was closed already. There has been no announcement by Ryanair that the gate changed or that plane is ready to board nor a last call for missing passengers for the flight. Instead we have been told at the gate that our luggage has been unloaded, which took more than 45 min to reach the belt which prevented us from taking any other flights the same day. At the “help” desk we were informed we can pick it up and book a new flight  (which by the way was not guaranteed) the next morning. We have been informed by other airport employees that this is the """"Ryanair-style"""" hoping passengers will miss their flight and have to rebook for extra money. Shame on you! By the way, we have not been the only ones missing their flight that day. 
I guess if one is used to a high standard  service by other airlines like Swiss, Singapore airlines, Aer Lingus etc then one shouldn't expect a lot from a low class airline. All the announcements that should have been voiced by the airline are just long time standard procedures which are obeyed for years at the airports. It is really low to choose not to provide a basic service for their clients. 
Due to urgency of a return we have booked our new flight with Aer Lingus, paid a little more, but could be certain to get the service we expected. And guess what! They announced as soon as the flight was ready to board - and it didn’t look that difficult. We hope that Karma will serve you well in future endeavors as a company.
We learned that cheap flights cost more than the “expensive” ones and the bill is served in a very cruel way.

11.0687236785889,1.63821816444397,"Ryanair Refund Issues",1,"My wife and two friends booked a return flight to Murcia in Spain with Ryanair.
Due to a French air traffic control strike, the return flight has been cancelled, leaving my wife and her friends stuck in Spain.
I accept that the french ATC strike is out of Ryanairs control, but the customer service from Ryanair isn't and quite frankly, it's non existent, as it seems their philosophy is 'We've got your money, Sod you!'
There was an email sent to my wife two days prior to the cancelation with a link on the email to their website for instructions on how to change to an alternative flight.
Unfortunately on using the link, the site you get sent to just contains the message 'Error! Please try again!'. Other links take you to a page saying 'This page does not exist'
Because the flights were booked through a third party 'Booking.com' I phoned booking.com up for my wife and after lengthy explanations and talking to two agents, I was told that as Booking.com is an agent, they don't have the authority to change flights.
I rang Ryanair and after a wait of around 10 minutes, I explained to the operator my wifes situation.
The operator was absolutely no help and just stone walled me saying 'I can't give you any information as you are not the person who booked the flights'.
I tried to explain to her that my wife couldn't change the flights on their website, as it was just showing error and saying it couldn't be done, due to booking through a third party and the third party was unable to help, but just got stone walled again, by 'I can't give you any information as you are not the person who booked the flights'.
I tried to explain that it would cost my wife a small fortune phoning the company from abroad and if she had to wait 10 minutes to get a reply as I had, it would cost over £10 just to talk to someone, then all the extra costs on top of that ...'I can't give you any information as you are not the person who booked the flights'.
Basically, Ryanair have cancelled a flight and just abandoned people in Spain who can't change their flights due to a website which just continually shows an 'Error' message and won't give advice to anybody else related to those people to pass on to them to help them get back home.
My wife will now, hopefully manage to arrange herself extra accommodation if need, find her way to an airport if she can manage to book herself another flight home, to an airport somewhere in the UK and hope that I will be able to come and pick her up and bring her home.
It is going to be a lot of extra cost, which she can't really afford, because of 'I can't give you any information as you are not the person who booked the flights'.
Avoid this company a all costs. You think that you're getting cheap flights, but when things go sour, you get absolutely no help and an extra expense to sort things out by yourself
Latest update:- After being on the phone with Ryanair customer services and getting absolutely nowhere and getting no help whatsoever, my wife and her friends have had to cancel the Ryanair flight and try to reclaim their money and booked a flight back home with Easyjet. Other air companies are still managing to fly even with the French ATC strike, but it seems Ryanair would rather you just cancel your flight and try to reclaim your money than be bothered trying to help you out and get you back home."

We was in the queue and my girlfriend was challenged with the size of her bag. She followed the rules, although upset, went to the till and tried to pay for it. It was only 1-2 inches off the limit and only the little wheels were off the box! She then proceeded to one of the staff to pay who said it’s okay you can go through. Why would someone pay £70 for wheels hanging out when there’s half of people on the plane with worse sizes. My girlfriend went in and was about to board the plane and Mohammed S. dragged her back in while saying “you’re not getting back in the plane then” as she explains that she was let through by his colleague. I was still in the back of the queue at this point. As I was about to get my passport checked, I seen her walking back in. This is when she started to cry, walking in like a criminal while Mohammed S. shouts at her. This is when I came in. 

I said what you’re doing is unacceptable and especially your tone. She was willing to pay but courtesy of your colleague she was let though. It is extremely unprofessional for you to ignore that. At this point, all his colleague knows he was being unreasonable and unfair. Mohammed S. had a brief conversation with his colleagues and we was let through for the second time. However, we was stopped again when I asked for his name! What an embarrassment! Zero level of professionalism!

These are so unnecessary and again poor complaints handling for Mohammed S. I was angry at this point but remaining calm. We was mortified. He retaliated for approximately 10 minutes. Eventually after third time we was let through - should’ve done this in the first place! 

As a person who deals with customer and professional complaints on a daily basis Mohammed S. skills are suboptimal. Furthermore, his professionalism lacks which is the key attribute of being a successful hospitality member of staff. I am sure we’re not the only one experiencing this hence the long email to speak for everyone feeling victimised before they go on holiday.

10.112476348877,-0.504416942596436,"Ryanair Flight Delays",3,"Pisa airport is a seasonal hub for Ryanair.  The airport used to be a disastrous experience for passengers in terms of the airside shopping, gates and passport control (for non-Schengen).  After a makeover of sorts on the ground floor, the airport is now slightly less than disastrous, but still fills the non-Schengen passenger with trepidation once you enter through the front door of the airport.  
Schengen departures gates are all on the ground floor, along with the majority of the shops, and obviously there are no passport control points, because it's for Schengen departures.  Non-Schengen gates are upstairs, behind locked doors, at the top of escalator/stairs (plus a lift which always seems to be out of order - as is the escalator sometimes).  The non-Schengen doors are unlocked only when a flight to these destinations is about an hour to boarding.  Often there are several flights close together to non-Schengen countries.  This creates a logjam of potential passengers crowding behind the doors and spilling down the stairs back towards the Schengen area.  It is not clear why these doors and access to non-Schengen area are locked for long periods, unless it is because the police authorities which man the passport booths lying beyond the doors will not maintain a continuous presence there?  In any event, as the Schengen area is not air-conditioned (or if it is air-conditioned, it's not giving the human body any indication that it is) so standing around in baking heat rapidly becomes an ordeal.  There are 10 times as many people as there are seats available in the airport, and it has been this way for so long that one has to presume it is a deliberate airport policy to make the experience of flying out of Pisa a most unpleasant one.  When the doors to non-Schengenland are finally opened, it is common to see the biometric passport control booths 'out of order', thus channeling hundreds of tired, hot and frustrated passengers through one, or at best two manually controlled (i.e. by policemen/women) booths.  What is it about Italian airports, including PIsa, that makes them treat passengers like this? Finally, if you're near the first wave through the non-Schengen doors, you might reach a seat to take the weight off your feet.  However, quickly another anxiety arises in your chest when you see a disorderly queue already forming roughly around, but not exactly at, the designated departure gate for your flight.  Ryanair signs for 'Priority/Non Priority' are totally ignored as passengers stand everywhere in a very rough conga line but without any borders, if that makes sense.  In other words, the conga line is as broad as it is long, thus begging the question, why bother with putting up Priority/Non Priority signs.  It does not seem to be the case that Ryanair staff are 'in charge' of the boarding system at Pisa, even though it is a hub airport for the airline.  Therefore, when the call is made for boarding, all the people who were lounging up to a kilometer or more distant (I exaggerate slightly to make the point) and all those people who chose to sit the wait out on comfortable chairs rather than stand with the idiots in the disorganised conga line now sidle up to the top of the queue and get the chance to board the airplane before anyone, regardless of Priority/Non Priority status!  Fools and their money easily parted by Ryanair, perhaps?  Then on board, it's a gamble as to whether you will be able to place your own carry-on luggage in the bin overhead your assigned seat, because all those lucky people who were, but shouldn't have been, allowed on the airplane before you, have deposited their own luggage in the first bins they meet on the way in to the airplane i.e  the bins over your assigned seats, so that they will have an easier exit at the other end of the journey.  You now have to battle your way down the aisle to place your bags over someone else's assigned seat, and battle your way back to the front of the airplane, while the cabin crew look elsewhere and refuse to police the priority rows' overhead bins."

Check-in coming and going was great. At both Schiphol and Malaga, the desk personnel were friendly and fast.  

The flight took off about 30 minutes late, so not too bad on that front. We were running up against a crew timeout, so they had to hurry people along, but they handled it well as did the passengers. Seats are on the low end, even for a low-cost carrier. A bit hard, a bit worn out, no recline, no seat pocket, no charging options, and  a bit dirty. There didn't appear to be any cleaning going on between flights as we boarded as soon as the last few people from the previous flight left. 

After some strange hard braking maneuvers leaving the gate, we were in the air. We made decent time in the air and the outgoing flight was acceptable except for cleanliness. The flight crew was inoffensive. 

The return trip also left about 30 minutes late, and the plane was packed. They had overbooked carry-on luggage, so boarding was quite disorganized. DO NOT book priority boarding and overhead luggage if you can avoid it on a busy route, there may not be space. We had hold bags, so it wasn't an issue. Everyone seemed a bit stressed, including the flight crew, which didn't build a lot of confidence if an emergency were to happen. I get it, though; dealing with the public is never fun, but perhaps some people aren't cut out for FA work. The crew here would have made an East German border guard circa 1982 seem friendly and fun. 

The case for Ryanair is there in 3 instances. #1 If you have forgotten how bad it was and want to give it a chance. #2 if it's the only airline with seats left. #3 if you are counting every last Euro and it beats other airlines (all-in) by 50 euros. Otherwise, you are better off paying slightly more for ANY other airline. Also make sure you check the pricing including any options like bags, seat selection, etc as Ryanair charges more than many other low-cost carriers for added amenities and has less comfortable cabins and less friendly service.

She said our handbags were too big and he had to pay another extra 3 loggages with no refund so we ende up paying another 3 bags worth 200 euros with no refund to what we priorly bought.

She laughed said the airline was terrible and custumers always get ripped off making them buy the hand bags even though they do not fit. We bought priority access and it is exactly the same thing.

Let's start with their customer service, or lack thereof. Trying to get in touch with a representative is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. They conveniently hide behind an automated phone system that leads you on a never-ending loop of frustration. Don't even bother sending an email because you'll likely receive an automated response that is completely irrelevant to your concerns. It's clear that Ryanair simply doesn't care about its customers.

Now, let's talk about their deceptive pricing tactics. Ryanair is notorious for luring customers in with ridiculously low fares, only to hit them with a barrage of hidden fees and charges. Want to bring a carry-on bag? That'll cost you. Oh, you thought you could choose your seat? Think again, unless you want to pay an extra fee for that privilege. It's like they make it their mission to squeeze every penny out of their passengers, even after they've already paid for their tickets.

But the nightmare doesn't end there. Once you step foot on one of their planes, prepare yourself for a cramped, uncomfortable experience. The seats are like torture devices designed to make you regret ever stepping on board. Legroom? Forget about it. Your knees will be jammed against the seat in front of you, and good luck trying to recline without starting a domino effect of discomfort for the person behind you.

Let's not forget about the overall lack of cleanliness and maintenance. The planes look like they haven't been thoroughly cleaned since they were first built. The carpets are stained, the seats are worn and dirty, and the lavatories... well, I'll spare you the details. It's clear that hygiene and passenger comfort are not priorities for Ryanair.

And finally, the punctuality—or rather, the lack thereof. Ryanair seems to take delight in delaying flights without any explanation or consideration for their passengers' time. Expect to be left stranded at the airport for hours on end, without any compensation or apology. They seem to have no regard for the inconvenience and frustration caused by their frequent delays.

In conclusion, flying with Ryanair was an absolute nightmare from beginning to end. Their abysmal customer service, deceptive pricing, uncomfortable seating, lack of cleanliness, and chronic delays make them the epitome of an airline to avoid at all costs. Save yourself the headache and choose a reputable airline that values its passengers. Trust me, you'll thank me later."

Phrases I heard spoken by the Ryanair team:
“If passengers don't get in and quickly sit down, we're going to be held up by the regulator.” (After a 1 hour delay by the Ryanair team.)
""""Someone's going to have to lift their ass off the chair for Mistress to sit down."""" (After a client with a baby goes through document control.)

"""" I'm working """" (after the same passenger complained about the response. )
In general terms, every time I have traveled with Ryanair, the flight information is not provided in time, the boarding gate is not announced in time, the flights are always delayed, consequently landing late, which in turn compromises the remaining trips already planned by customers. And coincidence of coincidences, all of this airline's flights miraculously arrive at the same time in Stansted, which causes all passengers to pass through passport control at the same time, producing a crowd of 600 people queuing at the same time. But in the times we live in, there must be someone who thinks this is perfectly normal. This is not low cost. This is incompetent, poor quality, poor training, poor management and lack of morals.

Most of us know the misery of flying cattle class to our holiday destinations. If the flight is not much more than a couple of hours long we are prepared to put up with the privations given that the cost of the seat is relatively cheap. But Ryanair has managed to descend to a new low in its cavalier attitude to its clientele, its lack of proper customer service and concern for its paying customers in its pursuit for maximisation of profit.

Perhaps we should look more clearly at what a cheap seat actually entails. When you book on line the price pops up and one’s immediate response is that it looks like good value for money (certainly when compared to costs of domestic or national  carriers). Adult fare (one way) amounts to £68.14. As you begin the booking process a series of options are presented. Firstly it becomes apparent that anyone going to Mallorca for anything other than an overnight stay will be required to put a bag in the hold (add £24). To add priority boarding a further £30 is necessary (so I declined this). Did we require “fast track”? Yes, the thought of standing for hours at border controls meant that the additional £8 seemed reasonable. Ryanair made a big deal about the order in which the plane would be boarded (from the rear), so I decided to pay an additional £8 to reserve a seat at the rear so I could be last on.

Total (one way, one person) = £108.14
Return Fare = £60.54 (with payment fee (!!!) £4.66
Total return trip cost = £168.68
Total for both persons travelling together = £345.38

So what was the reality?

London to Palma
Making one’s way to the remote outback of the Essex/Suffolk border is a bit of a pain and cost £90 in car parking fees. Billed as a London airport it is over 40 miles from the centre, but hey-ho, my choice, but clearly someone is making a tidy stash from providing a tarmac’d field to park in. The flight was scheduled for 12.55 so I duly arrived 2 hours before to complete check in. Glancing up at the Departures Board I noticed that my flight had the word “delayed” under the information column. Next I had to make my way to the Ryanair desks which were situated almost as far as it was possible to get to from the “Departure” doors at the outer reaches of Departures. Nonetheless I slogged my way to the Ryanair check-in where, naturally there was a long snake of people and their luggage all slowly trundling forward, vying to get in front of a Ryanair staff. Unsurprisingly not all the check-in desks were open so it was a long process as we shuffled forward pushing our bags with our feet or continuously lifting them up and putting them down again. Of course there were young children, and yes, some were crying, often in different languages. There being no allocated desk for the Mallorca flight, I joined the line of my fellow passengers heading for destinations like Warsaw, Munich, Vilnius etc. Eventually I found myself loading my bag on to the conveyor, but was unable to elicit any up-date on the delay. I don’t think the staff on the desk were actually Ryanair employees, merely disinterested ground staff. I then set off to the shuttle train that was to take me to the gate. I checked the Departures Board again, but the information was confined to the one word: “delayed”. Fighting to board the shuttle – it was rammed check-by-jowl with frustrated persons unaware of British queueing etiquette, or simply non-conforming, I travelled the short journey to the gate. Yet again there was a vast distance to be covered by escalator, stair and walkway. Arriving at the Gate the Departures Board now contained new information about my flight: “relax”. RELAX! It was almost insulting. Having already journeyed many miles to get there, stood in lengthy lines, made elaborate arrangements for pick-up, transfer and onward travel the other end, I’m now instructed to relax. The attempt at a light-hearted joke just fell flat. This might have been made easier if there had been some information about the delay, but for the next hour or so the only two “informative” words that appeared were “delayed” and “relax”. Not the best start to an eagerly awaited holiday. But worse was to follow as Ryanair did its best to subvert the norms of order and encourage chaos.

The next obstacle to overcome was the security check. I’d paid £8 to be “fast tracked”, thinking this would be money well spent after previous experiences at Gatwick and Heathrow. I think I gained a 2 minute advantage over other travellers and still found myself clutching my trousers up with one hand whilst carrying my flight bag in the other. I understand the requirements for security as well as most (I was in the air during the 9/11 attack), but again, I have to question the way this is operationalised. There must be a better means of identifying non-threatening passengers using current technology rather than subjecting everyone to the indignity of removing belts and shoes. After all, this was a “holiday” flight.

The flight was eventually called for 15.40 (i.e. over 2 hours late), by this time there must have been about 180 passengers together with their luggage, slumped over the limited seating by the gate or sprawled over the carpets in the lounge. At 15.20 the desks to the gate were occupied and the flight called. This mystified me as I could see no aircraft on the apron. However, the effect on the passengers was to immediately excite them and they began to gather in front of the desks. We were then told to queue up – those passengers with priority boarding (not me) to form one line, and the rest of us another adjacent to it. The priority passengers were allowed two cases in the overhead lockers as well as a smaller cabin bag. It was noticeable that many of them had rather larger “cabin bags” – rucksacks in many cases, and it seemed apparent that the restrictions were not being upheld in this queue. In my line, however, some poor Dutch girl was apprehended by a Ryanair employee for having a bag that did not conform to “cabin” size. She placed it in the framework used to judge bag size and the top of it poked up barely an inch above the line. For this indiscretion she was forced to place her bag in the hold for the price of £30. This appeared to be somewhat arbitrary, but also clearly discriminatory as the “priority” passengers had no such checks. Also it became obvious that non-priority passengers had joined the priority line towards the rear of the queue.

But in a sense it didn’t matter. The only movement was down the stairs towards the apron, but no further. People just had to stand in the heat (it is a glass-fronted lounge) or uncomfortably on the stairs until the aircraft eventually appeared. One elderly man had to sit in the check-in desk chair as he felt unable to stand for the time it took to begin boarding.

When the aircraft turned up it turned out to be a “Lauda Air” flight. In my mind’s eye I had an unfortunate picture of Lauda’s final flame-enveloped race. Not a great scenario before getting on a flight. The Austrian attendants made it clear that they were operating a Lauda flight on behalf of Ryanair, but still no apologies were made.  (that Lauda Air is now part of Ryanair should have warranted some sort of statement on behalf of the parent company). In the days and week preceding my departure I’d been inundated with several emails and texts from Ryanair informing of the protocol employed to ensure a smooth check-in, boarding and flight. So far every item had been breached – in this instant the Ryanair pledge of “boarding at the rear” was overruled, and, as we spilled out on to the apron there was an unruly dash to the front and rear of the aircraft to grab one’s seat and secure any overhead storage space available.

The flight was full and all the more excruciating because the rear seat I had selected was extremely uncomfortable with minimum leg room – my mistake, but what is the thinking behind creating such a tortuous seating plan? I understand the economics, but Ryanair et al are all profitable and remain slightly cheaper than national carriers and fly to more destinations. Surely they and others could still operate profitably while providing more comfort? The seating plan merely demonstrates a lack of respect for the paying customers, most of whom will have little opportunity to exercise choice.

So, seven hours after setting off from home with only a cup of tea for breakfast, I needed some refreshment. Stone me, its card only and I’ve to part with E3.00 for a luke warm cup of black tea and a sachet of long-life milk. I need a real drink: that’s another E6.00 for a bottle of cheap white wine (250mls). At least, being near the back I got served first, but I was also the first to have the catalogue of purchases foisted upon me. Clearly much more time and effort was expended in persuading us passengers to buy stuff we don’t really need than to provide sustenance and comfort. The attendants were not unfriendly, but there again, not friendly either. It can’t be much fun cooped up with a disgruntled and frustrated crowd, but service with a smile would go some way to making the journey more tolerable for all.
Landing in Mallorca is almost a mirror image of departure. The gate is far from the main terminal and the baggage reclaim is the one furthest from the passport control. You had to retrace your tracks to get to the exit. But at least I was in Mallorca.

Palma to London
This gets even better. The flight was due to depart at 07.55. My choice again as I wanted to be home for midday. The early flight meant getting up at 4am to await transfer to the airport, where I arrived just before five. First thing I noticed was there was no information next to the flight number. The Ryanair information on my printed boarding pass informed me that bag drop would be available at 05.55. Breakfast-less yet again, I decided to join the queues at the Ryanair check-in irrespective of the time in order to shed my bag. Once again there was a lengthy line snaking its way to one of the three open desks. Is this the price we have to pay for cheap flights? It just feels so undignified. There must be a better and more efficient way of doing things that relieves stress on travellers, or doesn’t anyone really care?

Eventually the Flight Information Board indicated that, yet again, our flight was delayed (at least no exhortation to “relax”). A gate eventually was posted – again it was somewhere at the airport perimeter (nearer to Palma than the terminal) so the long march continued. Arriving at the gate were 40 or 50 people asleep on benches, on the floor or simply slumped in chairs. Some had children who were awake and voicing irritability – this time mostly in English.

The flight was eventually called over an hour late. A similar thing happened as on the outward leg of the journey: people queueing to get on a plane that had not docked. I could see them down the corridor and down the stairs leading to the apron entrance. After 15 minutes two buses appeared and people got on. There was then a short trip around the terminal to where the Ryanair plane was parked. As before, there was a bit of a scramble to board. I had paid £8 extra for a specific seat – only to find that the aircraft type was different to that advertised and I found myself several rows from the back – same seat number, but different location. Not what I had paid for, and I don’t expect that I’ll get a refund. I’d forgotten how ugly that yellow and blue livery inside the plane looks. Expensive refreshments (I didn’t bother) and little communication from cockpit or attendants. The whole thing is understandably pared down, but in doing so the whole experience (once part of the holiday experience) is not only lesser, but actually a misery. I don’t think I’ll be flying Ryanair again."

If you do not pay for a seat you cannot check in until 24 hours before the flight but this got worse when we got to the airport and began boarding the flight.
We checked in and got allocated random seats i was sat at the front and my daughter at the rear which was not an issue as the flight was only about 45 minutes but when i boarded the flight i was moved from my original seat due to there being Ryanair crew on the flight and little did we know that the last flight the night before had been cancelled which they are allowed to do if you do not pay for a seat but my daughter was told they did not have a seat for her and stopped her boarding which is another thing they can do if you do not pay for a seat bump you off the flight anyway at the boarding gate it was total chaos there was at least 8 people who were trying to get on this flight including my daughter. Meanwhile on the plane i mentioned to a member of the cabin crew that is was travelling with my daughter and if she could not get on that i wanted to get off and the response was pretty much no descript but i had a trainee cabin crew member sat behind me who was going to Dublin to be trained and she was totally shocked by the whole situation.
Meanwhile at the gate the staff did not have a clue what was going on and finally my daughter got a boarding pass to board the flight along with another person who was on the cancelled flight from the night before.
Anyway when they got to the plane to board the aircraft the cabin crew looked at them puzzled and said why had they sent two people as they only had one seat left not two but luckily for me my daughter got the last seat but it just proves they had not got a clue who was on that flight and it had turned into total chaos and when i boarded the gate staff did not even scan my boarding pass so how can they possibly know who was on the flight.
The flight left 55 minutes late and probably cost the airline more in charges for being in the ground much longer than it should have been anyway the flight past without anymore incident and was about 40 minutes and i can not say anymore about Ryanair that is good.
The moral of this is that for me the issues on this flight that i encountered are a major security issue  and i cannot believe this happened especially after everything that has happened in the past and i am still in total disbelief and very concerned at the way Ryanair are running their airline and for me personally putting my family in possible danger.
I will also be emailing Ryanair directly to let them know my concerns especially knowing that the return flight they did not scan my boarding pass either and made an announcement on the aircraft asking if everyone was going to Manchester which speaks volumes.
My biggest worry is i have other flights booked with this airline and id going off these two flights i would certainly not recommend this airline but will see what Ryanair response is when i email them.

We booked 3 rear seats(last row) to make sure my pregnant daughter was near the toilets and to hopefully make her access easy by avoiding long stuffy queues whilst disembarking. I had paid and had boarding passes, but on our travel day we got to the gate and our Ryanair app had changed our passes from our paid booked rear seats together to allocated at gate with no explanation or notice, I spoke to the assistant at gate but she actually ignored me and said nothing, we got on the plane after being randomly allocated seats in row 18 and not actually together and were nearly last of the plane after waiting for front and rear to disembark. Normally I do not care about queues or where I sit as I am very patient,  but I was very unhappy that the only reason was to assist my daughter, and the cheating Ryanair willingly took the money for the booked seats then takes the seats from us. This is the last time for sure I will use this scummy company and I would advise others to consider using alternative companies as these scammers are near impossible to contact unless it's booking and it's entirely in their own interests and that is money and nothing else."

I woke up at 5am, with a flu, to catch what should have been a 1.5 hour flight from London to Berlin and spent 15+ hours today at the airport due to Ryanair. It was the worst travel experience of my entire life and a disgrace and embarrassment for an airline operating out of one of biggest cities in Europe. Ryanair staff directed me to print my boarding thru the bag check in line instead of customer service out of total maliciousness carelessness in ignoring what I was saying (I did not need to check anything as I paid the fee for carry-on and specifically asked for help PRINTING MY BOARDING PASS) and by the time I realized this idiot's mistake it caused me delayed to get the security, security decided to go through my bag, and I was late to the the gate.

Attendant literally shut the swinging the gate door in my face as I approached as SHE LET THE LAST PASSENGERS, A FAMILY, PASS THROUGH claiming they had already been there and where just paying extra charges so they could go through, but I cannot, because I did not come on time, but THIS FAMILY CAN BOARD, BECAUSE THEY ARE BUSY PAYING FOR SOMETHING. 

I woke up at 5am to make this flight, arrived at 6am and thanks to completely carelessness, incompetence and maliciousness of staff I missed the flight and an important personal event in Berlin. I was forced to walk all the way back to the front of terminal dragging an extremely heavy carry on (I weight 110 ilbs and my bag weighted probably 100) to buy another ticket because I cannot use an e-pass due to having an American passport, told the only flight I can get on is at 6:30pm, forced to go through security again,. Come 5:30 the gate is finally announced and half the plane passengers cannot get to the gate (which closes in 20 minutes) because the shuttle doesn't work. Again I have to drag an extremely heavy carryon half way across the airport because one Ryanair staff decided to tell us, we can be let thought the security door at the end of the terminal to out gate section (probably to get rid of us and make it someone else's problem), which turns out to be wrong, and we are told by another staff member to turn around and run all the way back to the shuttle because now it is working again. We have ten minutes now and half the plane is late and exhausted, I have the flu the entire time and I am typing this now from my bed in Berlin.We are able to make it only because someone finally decided to hold the plane for ten minutes, as apparently planes can wait momentarily for passengers who are 5-10 minutes late. This is normal in ever other airline I've traveled, but I guess for Ryanair it's extremely difficult to almost impossible and it's better for half the plane to run laps with heavy bags back and forth around the airport first just in case we ever want to audition for Squid Games. 

I have traveled through airports and airlines in countries like Russia, Georgia, even Romania, and I have never encountered such a sheer level of malicious incompetence and carelessness, horrible customer service and power tripping.  The only people who tried to actually tried to be helpful and compassionate in the entire 15 hours I was in the airport was the lady who escorted me back to the  front of the terminal and the man who spoke to me at the gate of my first flight after I finished crying (I refuse to acknowledge the woman who shut the gate in my face and I hope the next person she decides to screw over is a UK citizen with time and resources to make her life a living hell). I will never take this airline again in my life and will make it my personal mission to make sure anyone I know traveling in Europe does not even think of using this airline.  Evidently all my European friends already do this."

Last year, I booked a round trip from London Stansted to Prague back in February 2022. I booked the flight at the same time as the accommodation for the 14th - 21st March, with the outbound flight leaving at 9 o’clock. Everything seemed to be just fine as I completed the booking for said dates. The problem started when I went to check in the night before I was meant to fly out; it turns out they had changed my dates from the 14th - 21st March to the 21st - 25th. Upon realising this, I changed the flight details back to the original dates that I had booked and they charged me an extra £413 just to do it. Cancelling the flight was not an option as I would have lost my accommodation as well. Their website barely functions properly either as when I tried to download my boarding pass, it just took me back to the homepage of their website, which then lead to issues when I arrived at the airport. The member of staff at the check-in desk was also quite rude as when he asked for my boarding pass and I explained the issue to him, he scoffed and put on the system that it was unreadable in order to print a paper copy out, stating that they normally charge £6 for paper copies otherwise, which is outrageous considering that their crappy website wasn’t working to begin with, leading me to not be able to obtain a digital copy, especially when you consider that other airlines give their customers paper copies of their boarding passes upon arrival free of charge. 

As if none of that was bad enough, upon contacting Ryanair regarding the mistake made with the flight dates, they denied any knowledge of the matter and claimed that those were the original dates that I had booked. After trying to get my money back through the bank and contacting them again, I’ve been left £413 out of pocket and will be seeking legal advice on the matter. It’s disgusting to think that an airline like this can stay in business these days given that there are various laws protecting the consumers from getting cheated and lied to by businesses. Ryanair is an absolutely rotten airline that deserves to go bankrupt due to the way they treat their customers. The fact that they market themselves as a low cost airline is an absolute scam, considering they charge extra for anything and everything. While this may have happened more than a year ago, I still feel that it is important to share this experience as a warning to other people who may be considering booking flights with them
and a bad experience is a bad experience regardless of when it happened. They are an absolute joke of an airline and to anyone who is considering using them I recommend to save yourself the stress and pay a bit extra to fly with a better airline that won’t rip you off. The price difference isn’t enough to be considered worthwhile anyway."

The system will show you """"Not refundable"""", giving you the feeling you have to only pay a change fee since your original price was higher than a new one (see picture below). However, this might change on the following page if you proceed. Ryanair will add extra cost which you have no idea where it came from and ask you to pay a difference between flights of which you did not know - at least a click before you didn't. If you pay before realizing this there is no way to get money back. The customer help desk will tell you that it is because of a price difference and it all makes sense on their end.

We flew out of stansted to Lanzarote using Ryanair for the first time, only a little trepidation from reading some of the reviews on this very site.

Had no issues with online check-in, did it with plenty of time (approx 48hrs prior) and checked in for both flights, nice & simple process.

Naturally the cost of the flight was awesome, we were only staying a short time so we only had the carry on option and had zero issues with the staff in relation to this (which was one of the causes for concern), the Stansted experience with Ryanair was faultless.

The flight however was something else, first of all after boarding I was asked if I would mind moving since a gentleman now boarding had a broken arm, I queried why he couldn't sit in the empty seat behind me but I think it got lost in translation, luckily the man sat behind my wife suggested that he swap with her so that we maintain our side by side positions (we paid the extra for aisle seats next to each other) and so we did, that's just a minor gripe and nothing to really write home about even though I still don't understand why we had to move for this person.

Anyway, the big issue of this flight are the other passengers, well in this instance a group of Irish/Travellers who proceeded to annoy everyone around them even before take off. It all started fairly innocently with the suggestion that perhaps the couple in the aisle seats may want to swap as this group will be talking to each other (quite loudly as it turned out) and maybe this couple would prefer if it wasn't across them, the couple declined, suggesting to the group that they had paid for their seats specifically so they could sit on the aisle, I couldn't quite hear everything that was said but the phrase given from one of the group to the gentleman of the couple went """"you've got a face like misery"""" and of course that did not go down well, things were tense for a while but it was nothing that stopped the plane from taking off and so we did.
 
This is where we get to where I believe that airlines (not just Ryanair) need to do something because it is entirely avoidable, excessive drinking on a flight can at least be curtailed by NOT SELLING THEM ALL THE DRINKS !  (I saw at least 10 bottles of alcohol sold to one person).

The airline has the right to refuse travel to people who are already intoxicated but will happily allow it to happen on board because they're the ones getting the money from it and then complain when people can't handle their booze and kick off, ending up with people potentially getting arrested and deported immediately.
There was an incident from which I assumed it was the male members of the group that caused the trouble but it turns out that the 'ladies' were to blame, one or both of them were slapping the head of a male passenger in front of them for no apparent reason other than he was bald. This did bring down the wrath of the cabin crew and the people were seperated, luckily I think it was only minor aggression and not a full on brawl (unlike other recent flights on the news) the passengers were split up into different seats and no further trouble was heard from.

All in all the flight out was funny really but the shenanigans were avoidable.
The flight home this morning (as I type this) was much less eventful, the Azul Handling staff at Arecife airport were having to deal with some very annoying people who clearly were taking the p**s with their carry-on bags, including the couple in front of us with a fully laden pushchair as well as their bags and no, they hadn't paid extra, well, except now they had to.

It seems very simple to me when flying with Ryanair, they tell you the limits, they give you the weights and measures of what is allowed and explain very very clearly what will happen if you exceed this. 

This time I was not asked to swap seats, in fact my wife & I were lucky enough to have the entire row to ourselves, it was the most relaxing flight I can recall having. 

So, to sum up, Ryanair were pretty solid with these 2 flights the only problems came from other passengers in situations that are easily avoided."

Must have been my lucky day, I had a very smooth journey both to my destination and back with no trouble whatsoever.  It possibly helped that I was travelling with my husband and we had taken the decision to pay a bit more just to make sure we were sitting together, and we had no other family members to organise and pay for.  Flights were on time, chose the extra leg room seats and staff were very pleasant and working on a clean plane.  Helpful tip is that there are water fountains after security at Stansted so just took our empty bottles through and filled up to save on costs, also took a homemade picnic to eat on plane.  Tried to do same on way back in Crete but their policy is different and we had to buy a bottle of water to drink for our return journey.  Couldn't fault Ryanair on this occasion, all self service check in machines were working and staff were at hand to help too.  I tried to be extra organised and used an Ikea freezer bag to put my toiletries in beforehand which had to be transferred to a smaller airport sized bag so a lesson learnt there.  I'd use them again, it definitely saved us money.  I didn't see much point in spending extra for priority boarding either as we all pretty much queuing together and it didn't seem worth it for those passengers.

Yes, the seats are close together and the staff make 3 or 4 passes of the cabin, but the food and drink prices aren't too bad and they have offers on perfumes etc if you want them.

8.50310802459717,2.07100439071655,"Ryanair Baggage Policy",1,"I had thought Ryanair would have improved over the years, but I was completely wrong. 
The cheap flights are completely offset by added charges. Firstly with bags, the size they provide as acceptable cabin bags are miniscule - barely enough to fit a days worth of clothes and items - so we purchased a cabin bag. The cabin bag they allow is the size of a usual carry on; the small wheeled suitcases so many people use. However when we got to check in, everyone with us (after the priority boarding) had these suitcases with no problem? We paid to have a bag checked in, when everyone else carried theirs on with no problem. That was £55 extra.
We then had to pay to sit next to each other, as I was travelling with my partner. We paid for this on one flight, and for the return flight we checked in as soon as online check in was open. Even though there were only a couple of seats already booked and the entire plane was empty, it deliberately seated us far apart in order to make us pay more. When it says they cannot guarantee you will be seated next to each other, take it to mean they will deliberately seat you far apart in order to get more money from you.
Finally on the flight, having a flight attendant scream right next to you, as they yell at their colleague at the other end of the plane was interesting. Even more so was the aggressive way they do anything. I walk using a walking aid, and I called up to check this was ok before I boarded. After being told it was ok and that I would be able to keep the walking aid between my legs, an attendant roughly grabbed it on the flight and shoved it into an already full overhead locker, and then slammed it shut several times until it closed. This cracked and damaged the walking aid and I've now had to purchase another. When I submitted a complaint about this, I was told I needed to have filled in a particular form at the airport. I have never had an attendant damage the items I use to walk around before, and at no point does it say that if anything is damaged you need to fill in a form at the airport. I was then stuck in a loop of calling in to discuss this issue, being told to reply to an email and then being told they would do nothing as this form was not filled in.

After waiting at the Tangier Airport for over an hour after our plane was supposed to depart we finally started boarding and therefore missed our second flight by a long shot. When we went to the Ryanair counter we were told that refunds are not “really a thing with this company” and we now must PAY 100€ more PER PERSON to attend the next available flight out which by the way was not for 2 days. So altogether hotel, food, taxi to and from the airport we were down over 1000€ (unplanned) were not back in time for work and did not get a single penny reimbursed. When the same thing happened to us several years ago with Air Canada (an actual airline) they got us new flights without having to pay a 100€ per person fee, paid for our hotel stay with breakfast and apologized many times for the inconvenience it may have caused for our travel plans. From Ryan Air…not a word. As a matter of fact in the official Email answer from Ryan Air we were told that “WE” missed our flight and that’s why we will not get a refund although “WE” were at the Tangier airport waiting for a ryan air plane that was delayed over an hour long. We definitely learned our lesson with this joke of an airline and later upon reading some other reviews found out we were not the only ones. That was the last time we will fly with Ryan Air, next time we will book a proper Airline that takes responsibility for ITS mistakes!
We were actually not even the only ones on our flight with this connection, there were three more people. They also had to pay 300€ (total) to get a flight that landed in a completely different city as where they had to go and of course Ryan air loves to use the desperation they had to the fullest extent. And if all of that weren’t enough…every Ryan Air employee we encountered was in a terrible mood and just plain rude.

My name is Yuliia. I am Ukrainian. My 3 years old daughter Diana and I have Biometric residence permits in the UK and have lived in Scotland, Edinburgh since 07.05.2022 under Homes for Ukrainians Scheme. This year I decided to return back home to Ukraine. My daughter Diana does not have an International Passport as we were forced out of the country by Russian aggression and did not have time to prepare documents. The Ukrainian Consulate in Edinburgh issued a certificate for returning to Ukraine for Diana valid till 23.03.2023 which was intended for entry to Ukraine through Hungary, Moldova and Romania.

Before leaving the UK we stopped in a hotel in London to spend some time with a friend of mine, I had tickets purchased from another airline on a flight LTN - BUD W62202. I couldn't check in online without a passport for Diana so I paid for check in at the airport. 

On 9 March I was going home to Ukraine on flight London-Budapest at 08 20 am. We left the hotel at 04 53 am and arrived at the airport at 05 55 am. I was going to connect in Budapest to take an overnight bus to Lviv (Ukraine) and had printed tickets for the bus departing from Budapest at 08: 30 pm with me which I showed to a supervisor of the flight later.

When we arrived 2 hours before the flight, I was informed by the supervisor of the flight that my daughter Diana was not allowed to fly with the above-mentioned certificate. The sir said I can go only through Moldova with that document. This was incorrect and the certificate was intended for entry through Hungary, Moldova and Romania. I said that I had nowhere to go and tried to prove that the document was valid for going through Hungary. A team worker suggested that I fly through Moldova the next day on 10 March and pay for the flight again. Nobody seemed to be ready to help and extend understanding for a single mother with a child, not least as I had all the correct documents and it was the airline’s fault which ultimately cost me £285 (tickets, baggage, service of auto check in and check in in the airport).

I was shocked, frustrated and powerless having nowhere to go and having no money for a hotel. I had 4 bags, a child’s scooter and my sleepy daughter on top without having any support. Nobody provided me with denied boarding forms, it looked like the supervisor just supposed that the document was not appropriate. I did not think about insisting on getting any forms as I needed to think where to stay with my child because I was alone in the city with no money and place to go.

After calming down myself I decided to go to London Stansted Airport as there was a flight to Moldova the same day at 02: 40 pm. I had to borrow money from my sponsors in Edinburgh for a taxi and a new flight and the taxi and the new flight came to £488,39 GBP.

After arriving at the London Stansted airport while discussing the Moldova flight with a lady from the Ryanair airline team she kindly listened to me and before selling me tickets to Moldova she called the Immigration office in Budapest to check if we can still fly through it. And the Office responded that we are allowed to enter Ukraine through Budapest. I successfully purchased tickets for 09 Mar Flight FR1331 Depart STN at 05: 50 pm to Budapest ,checked in with the help of the abovementioned team worker and got on a plane to Budapest at 05: 50 pm. We arrived in Budapest at 09: 10 pm and got onto abovementioned overnight bus going to Lviv as it was departing later than expected. So now I'm already in Ukraine because there were no problems with getting on a plane,getting off a plane, nobody in Budapest even was a bit concerned about my child's documents. I'm happy that I went to the Ryanair team which helped me but due to the irresponsibility of the team of another airline I lost £488, a lot of time and had stress."

My friends had exact same size cabin bag and got through no problem. Bearing in mind I use this small case for hand luggage every time I fly. Without that being bad enough, we sat on the runaway for over an hour before take-off in Edinburgh because of some technical difficulty and proceeded to miss my bus from Dublin airport.

Seats are not comfortable,  bus seats are more comfortable to tell you the truth, I have a sore neck still over 24 hr later, there is no place to rest your head on the seats, Ryanair loves money, definitely would not recommend and definitely will NOT be flying with them again.

Enough ranting, overall, good for the price, but when you factor in fees, you could be paying a higher sum for the flight, (for example, tickets were £105 each return, but adding in fees, it came to over £1000) so bear in mind fees.

We had followed all procedures ie online checkin etc but had to queue to drop our bag off. The queue was huge and there was only 2 people booking in, one of which was on the fast track desk...not booking anyone in but on the phone. There were issues with others' bags etc which held up the queue even further. It was so bad that they were shouting out flights that were leaving earlier than ours which simply created more queues and added to the time that we were waiting. Trust me.....no one was bothered. Not even a simple apology for being kept waiting when we eventually got to the desk. 

The flight was also delayed due to an issue with the internal lighting so we had to sit on the plane whilst this was resolved at the terminal. On eventually landing in Edinburgh it took approx 30/35  minutes to disembark the whole plane from one door (not sure why as we had boarded using both doors) then for all passengers to be piled on to 2 buses. We were literally being screamed at 'theres 300 passengers to get on the buses....fill the gaps!. It was truly shocking. Whether its factual that Ryanair won't pay the money for us to disembark at the terminal or not I do not know, however given the delays, the service experienced etc it was the least we could do. No wonder they are 2nd but last (to Wizzair) in terms of service. I honestly have the opinion that they accept that!

We arrived at the airport for 8.15am, went through security in about 15 minutes, we got breakfast and got to our gate at 10am. The gate on the Daa screens was 117. While we sat there for 5 mins my friends phone got updated on the Ryanair app to the gate being 119 which was grand because it was right behind us.  I went to the toilet and within the space of about 5 minutes there were 3 announcements for a flight to amsterdam with 2 inaudible with the staff tapping the mic or it being muffled noises. The third announcement was an urgent announcement that stated a certain passengers name needed to get to the gate immediately because the gate was now closed. We put two and two together and grabbed our luggage, ran upstairs as quickly as possible and got to the gate they changed last minute. The passengers hadn’t even boarded the plane yet as we could see from the window and the staff member that treated our problem was the lowest form of helpful I have witnessed ever in the airport. She was rude, didn’t let us speak, kept talking over us and although the plane was still outside the window boarding passengers she refused us our flight. Bare in mind it was miles before the original gate closing time. 

We were then forced to run around the airport trying to get help from other staff members who were thankfully patient and understanding of our concerns. We had to go out through arrivals passport control and back into departures to make our complaint known and finally book another ticket. The lady Olympia at the desk was very understanding and kind and more than helpful.

Most negative reviews are because people either didn't check the luggage allowance (and it does remind you what you have when you book and check in) or people just assume it doesn't apply to them. Online check in is really easy and if you haven't purposely purchased extra bags you just get a small one. If it's important to you to sit together, buy seats.  It's not that hard.  I check the check in, seat allocation and luggage rules with any airline I fly with as they can all be different and Ryanaitlr style arrangements are not uncommon.  We have never had our bags measured or weighed at the gate or been charged for anything unexpected. 

We flew to Ibiza and back over Easter weekend. On time flight going out.  Drunken idiots on the plane should have been kicked off before we took off (hence 4 not 5 stars and also had run out of hot food on a teatime flight but plenty of snacks so...) but cabin manager handled the idiots well and prevented the situation escalating and the crew were lovely.

Coming home we had a long delay first due to a tech issue (had to get off and wait for a replacement aircraft) then French atc strikes.  Captain kept us updated and we appreciated the safey first approach, we would rather be delayed than fly on an unsafe aircraft thank.you! Again cabin crew lovely.  Very windy landing in Leeds due to storm noa but landed on the first attempt and the pilots came out to see everyone off which was a nice touch given the delay and hairy landing, neither of which was Ryanair's fault, just an unlucky day flying.

We still landed on time.  Boarding was quick.  Staff were generally pleasant and friendly.  I didn't purchase food or drinks as it was too pricey.  Bring your own or sleep!  I slept.  Low-cost budget airline so don't expect any perks like in-flight entertainment.  Seats were fine and basic for short haul.  Tightly spaced but short haul so fine.  I paid for priority which was good and you can include a cabin bag (check the size and weight before you go as the airline are strict) and you board first.  Planes were filthy as they fly back and forth and don't clean in-between flights!  Yes they can be cheaper but you have to remember that when you add on all the additions like luggage and if you want to select your seat, then it adds up.

We were due to fly with Ryanair - as a party of four - on Saturday the 1st of April. We did not pre-book our seats because Ryanair explicitly states: ‘Ryanair offers the option to purchase reserved seats or free seats, which are assigned randomly during check-in. Passengers who choose 'random seat allocation' can check in between 24 hours and 2 hours before the flight departure time.’ 

However, when we arrived at the gate, we were told that there was a possibility we would not be boarding the flight due to Ryanair ‘overbooking’ its passengers. Yet again, Ryanair state that ‘as a policy, does not overbook its flights.’ The staff at the gate then informed us that we would be able to board the flight after all and allowed our party to board the flight with the newly allocated seats. It soon became apparent that this was false information. The party had no choice but to separate and me and my partner were involuntarily boarded off the plane - without our luggage. This was beyond humiliating and caused upset all around. We were escorted back to departures where we were told our options and had to make an unexpected decision. Luckily, we were offered a flight from the East Midlands at 6:40 am the following morning. Despite taking the flight we were exhausted from the night before and could not check in to our hotel until late afternoon.

And to call them I was charged an international fee on my phone hone bill, since they don't even have customer support in the countries the fly from. While calling I had to wait for over an hour only to be passed on to the next person to try and help me. Incompetence is apparently a requirement to work for their support.

In the end they charged me for the more expensive booking, even if it was their fault, their app that didn't work, and their systems that are so cheap they can't even handle their most basic sale. It's a wonder they have any customers at all, or can even run a business."

I highly recommend you DO NOT fly with this scamming, thieving, disgusting excuse of an airline.
Upon arriving to Stansted airport to leave for Seville, my husband and I wanted to check our luggage. We paid at the machine £35.99 for his, 46.99 for mine as it was slightly heavier, we did this at the machine as recommended and then took them to the desk only to be told that only my husbands bag has been acknowledged. Holding the receipt I showed the rep that I have literally paid for my luggage to also be checked in, she told me it is not showing on the system and that I’d need to contact customer services. I did this online, as not to miss our flight. Each time i contacted them they sent generic emails telling me that I ‘may’ have filled out the incorrect form. I tried several other ways only to get the same response. After the message they would then mark my complaint as solved. I responded anyway on one of the messages to get yet another generic response concerning baggage allowances; therefore i replied asking whether they are literate at all, to be told  ‘we sympathise with your view, we regret that our position set out in our previous email remains unaltered’ which made no sense at all in relation to my claim. 
When going to Jerez to fly back to the UK we were told that we should check in 24 hours before the flight and then had to pay £60, having had no prior warning.
Once we landed back at Stansted to find my luggage case has been scratched down to the plastic, my first thought was to go directly to customer services, not knowing that id also need to report this to baggage before leaving the baggage area. There they told me i’d need to make the complaint online, i was hesitant due to my previous online experience with them but the rep reassured me. So upon doing this i was told i’d need a PIR number in order to process the claim! I have been given the runaround, going in circles which is actually causing more stress and frustration, within the commotion i also lost my passport trying sort this all out at the airport… there has still not been a resolution and i was refused a PIR number within 24 jours of reporting, i had even taken a picture of my luggage at the airport. Again I STRONGLY advise you to seek another airline because if anything goes wrong or any issues arise, you are unlikely to get a fair, reasonable solution or support from this airline even at their own error, they will not acknowledge it as so and you will have a battle on your hands, its soo not worth it!"

Boy, what a mistake.  

Delayed 2 hours departing from Bristol, no explanation for the delay from the flight crew.  Friend then had to hang around the airport waiting for me for two hours.  I asked the cabin crew once we were on board and ready to depart if they could find out the arrival time, as I wanted to let a friend know.  The answer came 20 minutes into the flight - when clearly I could not send a text message.  

Delayed three hours on the return, again no explanation from the flight crew or the Captain.  On every other delayed flight I've been on the Captain has usually come on the intercom once the flight is underway to explain the reason and give an estimated arrival time.  The announcement of the arrival time eventually came when we were nearly at Tenerife, but no apology and no explanation - tells you all you need to know about how they regard their customers.  The only answer I got when asking the cabin crew about the delay on the return leg was a big fat shrug, and then they got back to selling their lottery tickets.  Apparently there was industrial action over France, this was never explained.  My friend who was flying back to Switzerland was  also slightly delayed, but nothing like my delay - clearly anybody with a basic knowledge of geography knows that flights between Switzerland and the Canaries will inevitably also fly over French airspace, so why the difference in delays.  

The communication at the airport was non-existent, I have the Ryanair app (soon to be deleted), and the airline clearly had all my contact details, I could see from the departure boards that the flight was delayed, and eventually, about one and a half hours after this I got a text message from Ryanair, offering me 4 Euros to spend on a snack.  Well that's stunningly, insultingly, mean, you can barely buy a bottle of water and a packet of crisps for that.

Ryanair in their marketing literature explain they are a low cost airline so customers can expect no frlls.   This is BS as the Easyjet flights to the same destination on the same dates were in fact cheaper and the crew are by a million miles, much more professional.  Plus with Easyjet the size of the cabin bag allowance is approximately double.

I have flown enough and with enough different airlines to know that delays are never the fault of the flight crew, but they are usually helpful, polite and try to make the changed circumstances less of a burden for everyone.  This was not the case with Ryanair staff.  Trouble is they patently COULDN'T CARE LESS FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS.  The way customers are treated always filters down from the top, and as we know Michael Kevin O'Leary has nothing but contempt for his, so this is hardly a surprise.

We are Chinese- Canadian immigrants. Our flight was more than an hour delayed we took off at 17:52 when it was scheduled for 16:20.

We were waiting in line to board when the staff came to see our ticket as we had luggage but were non- priority. I said we purchased extra luggage and they said no it was impossible and completely dismissed me before I was able to show them an email. Even when I said we bought extra luggage and said we can explain the woman just kept repeating “no it’s impossible impossible” and dismissing me with a wave. 

I kept asking to speak to a representative from Ryan air or a supervisor but they refused. They also wouldn’t give me a contact number, email, helpline, other airport staff. As a customer, they literally gave me no options in someone else I could talk to. Eventually I agreed to pay because they threatened to not let us onto the flight if we didn’t (we had another plane to catch). I asked to see their identification cards once we paid as I was going to dispute this and the woman hid it behind her blazer when I asked and said it was impossible. I don’t understand why she would refuse to let me see her name badge if she followed procedures. Her mannerisms and the way that she responded makes me speculate she did something wrong. She immediately started shaking her head and hiding it. After we paid, they started boarding the other passengers while we waited at the counter. They completely ignored us as we waited there and did not give us further instruction. We stood there awkwardly for a couple of minutes. I eventually asked them what was going to happen to our luggage and they said someone would take it. No one took it. We paid extra (double the amount) for checked luggage that was not checked. 

This is the worst service I have experienced in my life. The treatment they gave us made me feel like I had no power and there was no way out of the situation. I felt helpless as customer and my rights as a customer to something as simple as their name was taken away from me. There is no excuse for how the airport staff treated us. The constant sighs, eyerolls, dismissive waves, and blatant declarations that we are at fault (they literally said, “no, you are in the wrong” when we didn’t understand the situation and asked for clarification.) were extremely demeaning. They dismissed us before allowing us to explain our situation, they prevented us from speaking to other supervisors/Ryanair representatives, and refused to disclose their names to us. 

I have contacted Ryanair regarding this situation. 

TLDR:

Complaints 
1. Gate Staff dismissed me before allowing me to explain that we paid already for the luggage that we did not check in (but they were cabin size) so we wanted to ask a Ryanair staff member about allowing us to bring it on board. 
2. Gate Staff did not allow us to speak to their supervisor or another representative from Ryan air, kept saying that things were impossible. They were passive, never looked us in the eye, and refused to disclose their names when we wanted to dispute what they were saying to us. 
3. Instead of explaining the situation, they threatened to not let us fly if we didn’t pay. When we wanted to record the encounter, they yelled and threatened to call the police. 
4. Refused to disclose their names when we asked for it 
5. This was all done in the most demeaning manner I have ever experienced. They were disrespectful from the beginning and never let us talk. They kept sighing, rolling their eyes, ignoring us at times, and blatantly saying things were our fault. 
6. The luggage was never checked, we brought it onto the plane as cabin luggage even though they told us it would be checked.

The plane was half an hour late arriving. We were told we were """"Boarding"""", but in fact stood just outside the """"Boarding Gate"""" for 20 more minutes before we were allowed to board.......the BUS!
The BUS drove 100 metres to the plane, where we stayed, in the bus for another 20 minutes. People were still disembarking the arriving flight.
Priority Boarding was a farce! We were third in the queue and ended up boarding practically last.

By this time our extra legroom seat in row 17 had no overhead locker space available, filled instead with lots of bags of Duty Free plonk and handbags. The point of the chap that is supposed to keep these lockers free for the sole use of the extra legroom seats was obviously lost on him. As you are not allowed to have bags under the seat in front by law, they have to go in the overhead lockers. But if there is no room, then it cannot happen. The aforementioned chap in charge of this was so busy sorting out rows 10 to 14 that when his back was turned the lockers in rows 16 and 17 were being sneakily filled. This chap was so disinterested in the predicament that we had to virtually shout at him to get his attention. Eventually he told another passenger that they had to stow a rucksack under their seat in front so we got room for our hand luggage. 
If Ryanair is going to have a policy of 2 bags; one in the locker and one under the seat, they should train their crew to enforce it.

Then the drinks service began. They got o row 14 and then decided that was enough and returned the trolley to the front. Rows 15 thru 18 never got a drink the entire flight (remember this is a 5 hour flight already delayed). However, our guess it was more important to the crew to have their laugh and a joke at the front of the plane than to look after their passengers.
As a result, we had no food or drink offered us the entire journey. Our guess is that Scratchcards and Duty Free were more important, but neither of those made an appearance either. More time to chat to each other I suppose.

When we eventually landed 30 minutes late, we were held up on the runway for another 20 minutes waiting for a gate to clear. This was nearly 1am in the morning. I'd have got out and pushed another plane out of the way by now!

Why do Ryanair have to agree to Boeing fitting concrete seats? After six and a half hours, my rear end was numb.

I'm not sure if the crew were properly trained, or if they were just tired. But they need to be put on a short flight and taught to serve their customers properly. Ryanair can be good, I use them all the time, but the flight was hopeless.

They received an e-mail the night before the flight saying they should arrive 3 hours in advance, so at noon, to board at 15h10.. We had everything planned so had to change our plans.
When they arrived, they had a long wait ahead of them. Finally they could start to board the plane at around 15h. They walked towards the plane, then had to wait for a very long time with the plane in sight. Then a steward came to tell them that the plane personnel was too tired to fly so they had to wait two hours.
They had to look for the new line on the boards, their flight just said 'canceled'. Quite stressful. They walked around the airport trying to get help, no help available. Then eventually the saw that they could wait at the same gate again. At 17h again there was a delay. Eventually their plane took off at 19u30.
When the arrived in Barcelona, the plane could not land, because there was too much traffic. They flew 3 times, almost 20 minutes, in circles avove the airport, with a LOT of turbulence, so much that the overhead luggage started falling out of the cabins, people were screaming, crying and vomiting all over the plane. My daughter threw up 3 times. Oh yeah, there were also no bags available so the threw up all over her clothes.
The pilot said: 'we're trying to land again, fingers crossed!' which scared the passengers.
My dad and daughter thought they were going to die.

Many people had bigger handbags than mine, another passenger measured his bag it was about 6 inches bigger clearly showed from the measurement box however she allowed by tumps up to him.

I had return flights booked with Ryanair from England(London, Luton) - Ireland(Knock)-England(Luton). 

I had no issues or complaints about the flight going to Ireland. However, on the return flight I was told by Ryanair staff that I was unable to board the plane, with the reason given being that I had  insufficient documents. 

I was allowed to travel using this same documentation on my outbound flight, and have in fact used this documentation to enter the UK from other EU countries on more than 20 occasions. I’ve double checked this since on the UK Gov website, and can confirm that I am allowed to use this documentation since I have pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme. 

I’ve never been denied travel using this documentation with Ryanair or any other airline, and I attempted to explain my rights to travel with the Ryanair tem members at Knock airport. They were reluctant to even investigate my situation further, and when I requested that they confirm this with someone who may have more knowledge on the situation, I was simply told “there’s no one available on a Sunday”. 

After calling Ryanair the next morning to double check my situation, I was transferred to Immigration, who eventually told me that the issue was between me and Ryanair, and that it was out of their hands.

To further validate my claims that I had the correct documentation for travel, when I eventually booked a flight with Aer Lingus the next day, they were happy to accept the documentation I provided. When asked, they also explicitly confirmed that any airline should have accepted the documentation that I provided. 
Due to what I view as an undeniable mistake on the part of the Ryanair team, alongside their unwillingness to even attempt to help me travel home, I was forced to remain in Ireland longer than intended. As a result, I had to pay for a hotel, use up more of my valuable annual leave at work which caused an unforeseen difficulty at my place of employment, and lose valuable time. 

As a regular Ryanair customer who has always had a good experience in the past, to say that I’m disappointed with my experience on this occasion is a vast understatement. Hopefully, by flagging this issue someone at Ryanair will investigate this matter further so that no one else will have a similar experience. I’ll also be applying for compensation in the appropriate channels."

London to Alicante: the flight was a wee bit late, but for some reason they made the passengers (for a full flight) queue down a set of stairs, and stand in the rain before we could board. Some of the passengers were elderly and there was nowhere to sit and no indication of how long we would have to queue.

On the plane, I sat down and my first thought was 'my back is going to be killing me after this flight' as the seat was 1"""" foam. Also, plane looked rickety and shabby so I was wondering about safety too.

I was not tempted by the food, drinks, duty free and/or lottery tickets the staff kept pushing. The endless announcements to buy all these items was annoying.

Alicante to London flight: the check-in agent refused to acknowledge/accept my prepaid suitcase receipt (I can't remember, but I think it cost 30 Euros when I booked the flight) and I had to pay AGAIN or else I couldn't board the plane. My Spanish is poor so I had my (native) Spanish cousin explain this to the agent and she would not accept my hard copy receipt so I paid AGAIN to check my suitcase. I had to leave the check-in queue as she could not accept payment, go queue at a different area and then return to queue again to prove I paid/check my bag and get a boarding past. That was super annoying and time consuming.

The moral of the story: you get what you pay for, and you may have to pay twice to check your suitcase.

He offered no further instruction so I asked him what happens now. He snapped back that my bag needs to fit into the hole. It didn't as my bag was about an inch too large either side. He offered no further advice. Again I asked him what happens now. He replied I need to wait until the end (until all passengers are on board) then I needed to go somewhere with him and pay some money. I advised him that this would be difficult because if he looked behind him he would be aware by now that my 85 year old mother was now becoming very tearful and stressed due to the flight having been delayed and also due to the fact we had to move gates 3 times. My old Mum standing him was very upset and stressed which he knew so he started to step backwards towards her and my Mum had to get out the way quickly. I explained to him that Ryan air had no problem with the size of my bag when I first checked it in on the outbound journey at Stanstead and he replied, """"then obviously they weren't doing their job, look you can complain if you like but not to Ryan Air, so that wont do you any good, but you can complain the the airport"""". He then reiterated that my mother can board the plane or stay with me but I will not be going on the plane until the end after I had paid some money (These are his words to the best of my knowledge). He was rude, intimidating, unhelpful at all times and showed no compassion to myself nor to my mother at how stressed she was.

Fortunately a moment later a second staff member stepped forward, and also a huge guy, shorter but a big bodybuilder, well he was more helpful , he still had a bit of the """"big I am """"about him but he did seem to want to help a bit and he simply asked me to take a few bits out, put it in the contraption again so it could fit, which it then did, then he allowed me to place the items back in the bag and we were on our way. No fuss no bother, job done. The second staff member did not appear very impressed at the way I and my mother had been treated by the first staff member. 

Once my mother and I were were back in the queue I over heard other passengers who had observed the situation describing the first staff member as a nasty bully, jobsworth, misusing/abusive his position to show off to some pretty girls nearby etc, etc. Well I dont know about all that, but I got the impression (I may be wrong) that Ryan air are might now be going down the avenue of employing big huge bullies  to intimidate and frighten simple holidays makers about to board, including 85 year old vulnerable passengers, just in case any last minute payments are required."

After being told there was nothing they could do and my only option was to contact stansted (who had stated on email it couldn’t be amended.. so a pointless endeavour). After a few minutes the online chat operator told me we were “going round in circles” and proceeded to close the chat!

On looking at me she over aggressively told me I couldn’t go on with the cup and was to take a seat and finish it (the queue was massive so not entirely happy at the thought of going to the back)  I said I wasn’t aware of that, and a sign or something would have helped. Also I have just seen people walk thru with theirs. She proceeded, and as god is my witness, she told me to “drop the attitude”!! I’m 45 yrs old and haven’t been spoke to like that for many a year.
 
I leave the queue drop the cup in a bin, line back up hand the ticket over and said her approach was extremely rude and unacceptable, to which she replied I had “cursed at her”… so now to add to her terrible attitude she is also lying as not one swear word left my lips.

Total chaos , stewardess did nothing to help me get to my seat! Return flight was even more stressful, special assistance in Brussels left me in the concourse after making boarding assistant aware of my situation as wheelchairbound. Again all passengers boarded, I was left behind until a Jetair passenger kindly made the boarding staff aware that I was still waiting. They admitted I had been forgotten and it wasn't their task to wheel me to the lift. I was finally put on board at the rear and again couldn't pass until the ground staff made a passage between the passengers to let me go to my seat which was already occupied! It begs thr question would the aircraft have left without me but with my luggage on board? No attempt was made either by boarding staff nor by flight crew to ascertsin the number of passengers where all on board. Security? It is a rule of thumb that passengers with special assistance are first on aircraft and are last to leave upon arrival. Because special assistance upon Malaga landing were not aware of my case I had to wait another 30min on the plane after all the passengers had left before they came to collect me. The plane was 1h10 late departing from Brussels but Ryanair did not mofify supposed arrival time in Malaga to reflect this nor was there any explanaition given . Shambles and shameless."

TODAY, when we reached at airport 2 hrs prior to departure. We didn’t checked in online but when we reached to get boarding pass they told us to pay £110 for printing of two boarding pass on the pretext that you didn’t check in online prior to 2 hrs of departure. However, the flight was not on time it was delayed by one hour. I have never seen these rule in my entire life. I am travelling with flight different airlines since long. They just pasted two sentences rule on paper[ But it never prompted while booking the flight ] & holding too many hidden charges. I am feeling looted by RAYANAIR.

However, delays was solely attributed to RAYANAIR. Even, this is not ended here, we boarded a flight on 23:00 one hour delayed to the original departure. In the mid air, they announced that we are landing in Birmingham instead of Stansted due to some air traffic issue. We were already delayed by 2 hrs despite that no one was there at Birmingham airport from RAYANAIR to guide & expedite the process of transporting the passengers. No one was telling the exact reason of this landing at Birmingham airport. Flight crew easily passed through airport without concerning to passenger. Flight crew member they know about these landing since boarding but they didn’t informed passengers. We were forced to sit at airports for 2 hours in the extremely cold weather. Eventually, I read to arranging a coach service as they were promised they have handed over to some taxi drivers for dropping to Stansted.  We reached our home by morning 4:30 am. It is almost 6 hrs delayed w.r.t original arrival. Now I am asking you to pay me back my £110 to my account

Even airport authorities was not taking responsibility of these act of unprofessionalism of RAYANAIR.

Airline took £110 for not getting online boarding pass, the Airline is just making profit using fraudulent tactics.

Here the most important point to note that the two flight ticket we have booked for only £74 . They charged us around 1.5 times for not getting online boarding pass. However, nothing message was popped while we were checking in online. Worst nightmare for us to travel with RAYANAIR.

We were fed a different story by Ryanair staff every few hours, and at one point had to leave passport control to collect our checked bags from the carousel and check-in for a second time at 4.30am (conveniently wasting another few hours to avoid organising overnight accommodation).

Shame on you Ryanair – the communication was at best barely adequate with absolutely no empathy or support afforded to passengers who were pregnant, with young children or those with special assistance needs. Staff knew absolutely nothing and were either a) visibly upset at the position they’d been left in by senior management (one staff member was in tears and had only been employed for 5 days), or b) just plain rude, quite happy to lie and/or pass the blame elsewhere?

WTF!!!! no explanation other than that and pretty sure i heard him call me something before hanging up. So I tried to fill the form in again and it wasn’t working so called the next day (26th November) and received “as my colleague already instructed you you’ll need to fill the form out” i said “yes but it’s not working” where she proceeds to give me the form link so i try again. Still doesn’t work so I call again on the (2nd Dece and ask for a manager but apparently there was none available so received a superior named Simon who very kindly (truly the only helpful person i received) saying “the claim is for a different queue so i need to fill a different form and he’ll pass my detail on to the queue too for me”.

Of course it’s a budget airline, so we were not expecting anything out of the ordinary. The first issue we had was with baggage - we checked our bags fit in the luggage checker which they did. They did not have these luggage checkers in the lounge, only during check in. We took photos. Immediately the lady who was checking our passports in the lounge held up her card machine and said we need to pay extra for our baggage as it exceeds the stated amount. We explained that this was checked in the luggage checker and presented photos to which she said we “could’ve edited them photos”. We showed her the timestamp and date and that it was a Live Photo - which was ignored and she demanded we pay or she would have to seize our luggage. We asked to speak to somebody in charge to which she refused and said we’ll miss our flight if we don’t pay. The second issue was that we actually paid extra for extra luggage. The staff member said this “isn’t true” - once again, we showed her the screenshot and suddenly it was real but doesn’t apply to our small bags (how convenient). We asked the member of staff for her name and she said it’s against the law to give us her name. At this point, we knew this staff member didn’t have a clue about what her role was, how to do it, or policies and legislation. Once again, we asked to speak to somebody in charge to which she responded “there’s no-one here”. The member of staff because very demeaning and stated that we “should fork out more next time”. Finally, we boarded the flight after paying an extra £80+. I simply can’t understand how you wouldn’t have a luggage checker in the lounge and rely on staff members eyeballing the luggage. I have attached a photo of this member of staff. We contacted Ryanair who stopped responding after we provided the video. Once again, convenient. This is now being processed with a lawyer who says this can very well be taken to court as they’re going against their own baggage allowance and policies. I should also add that the reason for this employee’s dismissal of the baggage was because “it won’t fit under the seat” - please see attached photos! :) we thought this may just be budget airline travel coinciding with budget attitudes, however we travelled with EasyJet following this and it was an absolute polar opposite experience. They were lovely, professional, were not accusatory, AND they had a luggage checker in the lounge!"

When I sent a complaint to Ryanair, all they cared about was refusing the  refund I was asking them for the luggage’s taxes, neglecting this situation.Having said that, this is definitely the last time I am going to travel with Ryanair. The customers must be their top priority and, as it was clearly mentioned, the clerks’ behavior does not reflect that. Me and my family are extremely annoyed by this situation and we hope that what happened with us never happens again with any other passengers.

Before the flight I had to call customer service, they answered quickly, knew what they were talking about, sorted out the issue in minutes and did so with absolute efficiency. When I arrived in Dublin airport to check in they were very efficient, the queue moved quickly and everything got done on time with no fuss. This was not a straight forward trip, I had a guitar and a child with me who was booked separately. On the return flight FR7902, Sunday 29th 6.15am I also had to check my child in and the operators computer crashed while in the middle of check in, within seconds she went over to another desk and I had the boarding pass in my hands within 1 or 2 minutes, it felt amazing and unbelievable. Both on the flights and at the airport the staff were pleasant, happy  relaxed and looked after us with a service which was over and above expectations. The company clearly looks after its staff and gives them the autonomy to fix problems and look after the customers. I felt as a customer that they valued my business, and this was a very cheap flight, it cost me more to get to the Airport then to fly to Germany. Well done Ryanair from Michael O Leary, the current CEO and all the staff, you are getting things very right at every level."

This was my first time flying with Ryan Air in over 5 years, and now I remember why I stopped flying with them.

First of all, they only check you in with self service machines which the scales are off, so your baggage will be over weight and then automatically charge you £11 per kg. Then they ask you to wait in line to upgrade your bags, that's another £39+ your kgs over on the faulty scales.

So for a ticket that cost me £24 with hold luggage, this trip ended up costing me over £145 and this is only the start of the story. The flight was then... Guess.... Delayed by 3 hours! No apologies and when all of these topics where brought up with their customer services team mentioned that anything delayed over 2hrs there is certain compensation required and brought up the topic of the whole situation. 

This was the worst customer services I've received especially as I've been working on the business world for 5 years and all I got after emailing them three times was 'Read articles ..... Etc' basically stating this is my fault and nothing to do with them, and guess what, not even any personabiloty or remorse was given or even highlighted any of the topics I brought up.

I have now raised a small claims court action against them with all of the information I have gathered during these situations.

Trust me and stay away from this company AT ALL COSTS! They put their prices low to f**k you with over charges on anything they can and they were even taking peoples luggage off the plane and saying they had to pay more.

Don’t be swayed by the cheap flights because they make up all the cost of your flight by the additional charges you have no choice to add charge at extortionate prices. Plane is often dirty with filthy toilets. Customer services is non existent even though staffs are on board on the flight. Rude and quick to be confrontational  at the soonest and minor incidents.

When collecting our suitcase from the carousel, I noticed that the top of our steel enforced case was completely crushed. Fortunately the contents remained intact however another holiday maker wasn’t so lucky as items of loose footwear could be seen moving round.
We approached the customer support desk. The Ryanair representative made no apology. He asked what state the case was in before we travelled and we told him it certainly didn’t look like that.
He asked what I’d paid for the case (£80) and how long I’d had it (2 years). He then told me that Ryanair would be prepared to refund 50 euros unless I could produce a receipt.
I explained that I hadn’t kept the receipt because I didn’t expect the baggage handlers to smash my suitcase and he told me there was nothing else I could do to claim higher compensation.
I had to complete the online claim form, which took ages, and waited for my compensation. No communication was received despite sending emails. After finally speaking to a human being via customer support and passing the complex security I was told my claim would be escalated and I’d hear from the claims team in seven days. Seven days later I’d heard nothing. I called again asking to speak to the person dealing with my claim and was told they don’t have phone communication in that department. I was told again that my claim would be escalated and I would hear via email within 7 days.
I did receive an email asking for complex bank identification numbers so they could pay the money into my account. Again it took ages to find this information. I sent Ryanair what they asked for. Another month passed and they told me I hadn’t told them the name of the account holder. This was a blatant lie. I sent them all the information again. Three months had now passed and I threatened to report them to the airline authority if they didn’t give me my compensation in 7 days.
This did the trick. They’ve now told me the refund has been processed but it will take 14 days to reach my account! Unbelievable!
Ryanair are fine when everything runs smoothly but if there are any problems they make if as difficult as possible to get compensation and will take as long as possible to sort it out. Very poor customer service.
When I took the destroyed suitcase to the tip the refuse attendant couldn’t believe the state of the case. We agreed that the baggage handlers must have purposefully thrown it as hard as possible against a hard surface to damage it so much.

In fact, it is best to think of Ryanair as a glorified bus that takes you to faraway places.  It is not pretty, but it works.
Everything Ryanair offers comes at a cost. After you pay a ridiculously low price for airfare, you will pay for luggage (even carry-on), seat preferences, food, etc. that brings up the price, but not to the standard airline price.  As for the flights, be prepared.  The seat can't be adjusted, there is no TV consul, and there is no 1st class, 2nd class, etc.  It was a little uncomfortable. 
They depart and arrival slightly late each time, but it is nothing horrible. I’m used to the big airlines being hours late. Ryanair was about 30 minutes late (at most).  I can live with that. I can also say that Ryanair succeeded in getting our stored luggage from point A to point B without any damage. Westjet baggage handlers…maybe you should take some tips from Ryanair?
Lastly, I can say that the staff were professional. I actually forgot my backpack on the plane when I got to Lourdes. I thought the worst had happened after I realized it was still on-board.

Upon arrival at the desk, I was told that my ticket would not be issued to me until I paid the 100 Euro difference that needed to be paid on account of the explanation at the desk that I do not qualify for residency discount in spite of having in my possession two forms of identification containing my permanent address while here in Spain on my TIE as well as having the designatied city and island I am working on: Palma, Illes Balears, upon the Ajuntament de Palma which is still valid March 2023. After 2 phone calls were made by 2 separate clerks to their higher-ups at the Palma de Mallorca Ryan Air check-in location, I was told that since my TIE says I am here on a student visa, I would no longer be acknowledged as a resident and would not qualify for a resident discount. I ended up paying the difference. One of the clerks printed my new payment receipt and encouraged me to reach out to Ryan Air online and file to receive a reimbursement. 

I heeded the clerk's suggestion and 2 different responses were given to me. 

1: That according to their system, I had failed to check in. This is not true. I DID make attempts to check in. If I were you, I recommend taking screenshots of the image you receive after trying to check-in and are told to report to the check-in desk to provide documentation proving residency and that a legitimate residency discount ought to be issued to you.  When this representative had told me that I failed to check-in, I told them that this is not true and that I, indeed, had checked-in insofar as I could as a non-citizen with residency permission could have. The claim was put on pause until after the holidays. 

2: According to their system, I had failed to present documentation proving I am a resident in Palma de Mallorca and that all payments with Ryan Air are final. As far as what Ryan Air considers resident and whether or not that depends on the clerks or management in charge during my visit to check-in, I am really not sure. If they consider my paperwork invalid then in their eyes, I have no valid documentation of residency. I responded that I had provided 2 forms of documentation to verify my residence on Palma de Mallorca and that I reassured them I had no interest in lying and that just as well, I would be happy to send pictures of the identification that I presented. I would have hoped for further opportunity to clarify with Ryan Air just what """"residency paperwork and identification"""" are valid. I have just flown with them twice over this Winter holiday and not once was I denied my resident discount (this complaint is regarding a flight prior to the holiday travel with Ryan Air). 

None of the explanations for why I was charged the difference corroborated. If your situation is like mine, and you are not a Spanish citizen and you are here on a student visa, with no blood ties or marriage/ couple ties to a Spanish citizen, I strongly encourage you to take screenshots of your non-boarding pass that gives you explicit instructions to go to the check-in desk to verify residency paperwork. 

There is no hard and fast rule anywhere that I have seen about this. Please make sure you check in in advance and take screen shots of your non-boarding pass after """"checking in."""" That is my only advice to you. And make sure to email and follow-up as I had done to see if you get fortunate with a representative and are issued a reimbursement. 

Note: Not all times that I visited the Palma de Mallorca Ryan Air check-in desk was I denied my residency discount. It was just not the day with the people that would consider my residency paperwork and identification as valid documents for residency.

First one I was in flight with another “fancy” airline and not much to say about how they cared for me. There was no attention or any care at all. 

However, this second time as soon as one of the Ryanair flight attendants realised what was going on with me, they were all over me, the support, the care, the treatment was completely out of this world. I was impressed by their training and how much they really wanted to show me that they were there for me. 

There were 3 people constantly coming to me offering me ice, water, a better seat. 
My husband was there with me (first time I was alone) but they cared for me in such a gentle way that I felt that even if I was alone that I wouldn’t feel alone. 

I know it all depends on people, it is not about Ryanair as a company, but I just thought that it be fair enough to leave here my THANK YOU to that specific crew.

The pain was overwhelming but they kept me calm, that made the situation a whole lot better.

I am aware of all the rules and regulations around Ryanair and I fly with them regularly as the flights are less pricey than Aer Lingus.  I am meticulous around boarding passes, times, seats, luggage.  My biggest issue with this is that Ryanair are sending me generic emails in response to my complaint.  They will not recognise the plain fact that he was checked in.  Is it a case that both parties on 1 reservation must check in and produce 2 boarding passes even though 1 is not flying? I have asked Ryanair this question but alas the generic and frankly banal responses are not helping.  Having spent 45 mins on the phone I mamaged to get a new boarding pass for the return leg as when I rang Ryanair they told me he wasn't checked in for return journey.

6.8739128112793,-0.81299102306366,"Ryanair Flight Delays",1,"Starting with the terrible boarding process, that had started way before the aircraft was ready to be boarded, which left passengers waiting crammed in a hallway, and then waiting outside around 15/20min to board the plane. Somehow this is a constant issue with Ryanair flights.

Once the boarding procedure was complete, it was announced that there was an issue with the aircraft and that we had to wait for engineers to check the issue. Once the engineers gave the ok, we were informed that we had to wait longer due to air traffic control.

During the entire time we remained inside the aircraft, which was more than three hours after the scheduled time of departure.

Once on flight, I've asked for a bottle of water to one of the cabin crew attendants, to which she proceeded to charge for it, which I refused to pay for. Then I've told her that due to our delay being superior to 3 hours and flight on distance superior to 1500km we were entitled to complementary food and drinks, and that asking for a bottle of water was pretty reasonable. Then she proceeded to explain that they(the cabin crew) were informed by Ryanair's customer service not to provide any complementary food or drinks, and that I should contact Ryanair's customer service in this regard.

I've proceeded to speak with Elania - cabin crew supervisor, who confirmed what the other cabin crew hostess said, claiming customer service from Ryanair informed the cabin crew not to provide free food and drinks to passengers.
Even though the delay for the flight delay was superior to 3 hours and a distance superior to 1500km, that would entitle passengers to that claim.
Elania also stated that the claim only applies inside the airport and not on the aircraft.

I wasn't able to find any evidence of that claim, and even if it that was the case, its worth mentioning that nobody was allowed to leave the aircraft and had to stay inside for more than 3hours after our departing time, preventing the passengers from obtaining food or drinks from the airport. 

This is unacceptable, and shows a complete disregard and lack of respect for the passengers, who are paying customers.

It is also worth mentioning that Ryanair refused to pay any compensation for the delay, claiming that they weren't at fault, and the delay was caused by ait traffic control. Which is false and it shows how dishonest Ryanair is as a company!

The reason the flight was originally delayed, was due to an apparent issue with the aircraft, that was flagged after tests were made, that needed to be checked, and we had to wait for engineers to check the issue in order to see if the aircraft was fit to fly, or if we had to change aircrafts. 
Once the engineers gave the ok for the flight to take place, we were informed that we had to wait longer because of air traffic control, due to the fact that the time slot for the flight was missed as a result of the first delay, and we would have to wait until we got another time slot. All this information was transmitted to us by the Captain on that flight.

The delay imposed by traffic control, only came as a result of the previous delay caused by Ryanair.
It's clearly Ryanair's fault, since if it wasn't for that delay caused by Ryanair, and we had left on time, we wouldn't have had any issues with traffic control.

Trying to blame the delay on traffic control is as ridiculous as a bus driver blaming his lateness on traffic laws.

This clearly seems like a very dishonest way of Ryanair trying to dodge responsibility, and avoid paying compensation."

I came into the airport very prepared for some epic negotiation and rattling off of passionate talking points, but none of that was needed. Find out more later:

On-time: Yes! Ryanair efficiency!

Service: The Ryanair staff were all quite friendly and helpful. One of the flight attendants on my flight was too safety-conscious around the implications of my disability and the event of an evacuation, but he didn’t insist I move seats or do anything special (not a repeat of AnadoluJet or Aerolineas Argentinas). I’ll let it slide. Paid snacks/drinks and duty-free items were on sale during the flight.

Seat comfort and cleanliness: I mean, come on, it’s Ryanair. The point is that you go in with hardly any expectations…well, maybe that you’ll arrive at Point B and the landing might nearly break your back! Heh. Despite that, the flight was fine for the 2.5-hour duration to London. 

Wheelchair: Here’s what really solidifies this five-star review. Ryanair, from the surface, appears extremely strict about wheelchair carriage requirements, strict even for European standards. Honestly, I did fib slightly to the check-in agent about the weight and height, but he even took out his little measuring stick to match my variables with his…and he approved it. This is my second time on Ryanair, but the reason I’m overly surprised this time is because my first time was on Ryanair’s Lauda subsidiary, and I departed a tiny airport without the measuring stick and the normal Ryanair wheelchair procedures. But Madrid is the real deal, with countless Ryanair departures every day and, I believe, Ryanair-employed staff. So getting through in Madrid was an amazing treat. I was going to push through anyway, but it saved me my voice at check-in. Thank you for doing the right thing, Ryanair!

The Ryanair app and website would not let us check in to our flights, despite it being 4 hours before the flight (the cut-off time is supposed to be 2 hours). The flight was delayed an hour, we arrived at the airport over 2 hours before the new take off time but they still would not let us check in without paying a check in fee of £110. This was over double the price of the flight itself. The customer service agent said we could contact them for a refund, but customer service have been no help whatsoever and has only given an automated response saying that there is nothing they can do and they recommend using a PC to check in - we were on a mini break and of course did not have PCs with us. 

I suppose this is Ryanair's business model: give the worst possible service and charge for any ridiculous thing they can, even when it is something that is the fault of their own service being down. I suppose the complete lack of customer service and help available with anything that could go wrong on, before and during a flight is also a part of the business model, as actually helping customers is expensive and takes time. They must assume people will still fly with them as their service is so cheap. But not me or anyone else on my trip ever again. 

DO NOT FLY WITH Ryanair. Your flight will likely end up being more expensive than other better, safer, more quality airlines that actually care about their customers due to the ridiculous surcharges they will give you on things that are out of your control and the fault of their poor service."

I have never been made so angry that I am shaking before. I show up to check in and they tell me I'm not checked in. """"Yes, that's why I'm here"""", I say. They then tell me that I am supposed to have checked in online, and that I'd need to pay an extra 55 pounds to check in at the airport. This was over 3 times the cost of the flight. I'm not actually that bothered about the money - if they had charged me up front I would have paid it. What bothers me is the underhanded way they surprise you at the last minute with this extra fee.

Obviously I got angry, and they insisted I should have received an email about it. I checked my emails and sure enough, no email received. They said that it was a common problem and that I could pay up front and complain later to get a refund.

This is an obvious scam. Obviously a lot of people who are used to checking in at the airport (as is done literally everywhere else) will get caught out, be forced to pay up, and then a certain number of those won't bother getting a refund.

After calming down I finally caved and said I would pay. When they realised I only had cash on me (I don't own a credit/debit card) they caved and waived the extra fee. A good resolution at least, but the whole experience was already soured.

Then, I began to pick up stories. Few of them were positive. Well, they certainly lived up to their poor reputation.

1. Reaching the gate, I asked one of the two agents if the flight was on time. She responded that it was. Instantly, the other agent stood up and came out from behind the counter, barking at me to go back to my seat and wait. I replied that I just wanted to ask a question. She said, """"Everybody wants to ask questions, go back to your seat and wait for the annoucements."""" Totally rude and uncalled for.

2. Ryan must have poor gate assignments, as they had to use a bus/tram to get passengers to and from the plane. No jetway, we boarded up the stairs. 

3. However, they boarded front and back, with passengers meeting in the middle and blocking the aisle, trying to squeeze past each other. If they had said people seated in the first certain number of rows go to the front, and the others go to the back, it would have worked. Poorly thought out.

4. Worse, the baggage handlers were outside as we boarded, and were seen slamming bags on the concrete ground. If anyone had anything fragile, I doubt it survived. My wife had a lotion bottle cracked. Horrible.

5. I put my backpack and jacket in the overhead bin, as many others did. One of the flight attendants took them out and gave that space to someone else, and I had to keep the bag in front of me. She didn't ask me if it would be okay, she just said she needed the space. Again, the rudeness is a key factor.

6. They offer no onboard service. This was almost a four-hour flight and they don't even give you water. Sure, you can buy a small bottled for three Euros. It's the first time I ever saw a low-cost carrier not even give water.

7. The beginning fare was low, but they charge for everything after that (including water), so in the end it wasn't so cheap. We could have spent the same for a better experience.

8. Final thing about attitude. As we left the aircraft, the crew totally ignored the passengers. No goodbyes or """"see you again"""", just nothing. It was the perfect ending, I suppose.

Flight meant to leave at 23:00 or 11pm in the evening, but unfortunately it was delayed till 4am in the morning. Airline left people to hang around for 5 hours and now when I am trying to claim delay or cancellation it says it was not delayed for more than 5 hours and it says that it was not cancelled. It is absolutely not true and I will rise the case with my bank as well as with my solicitor against Ryanair. 
I had to buy expensive food and drinks at the airport, there weren't any comfortable places to sit and later I had to come back by taxi to sleep in the town hotel (with expenses for at least £100) 
Furthermore, next day 12/12/2022, Ryanair created another flight which had the same flight number with X at 14:30 and they delayed it till later than 8pm to Luton which was a total disgrace, as again the flight was delayed every hour. Flight to Stanstead was delayed till almost 8pm from 6:30pm. Airport staff didn’t have and could not pass correct information for the passengers.
People only wanted to know a real information, nobody wanted to wait and sit in a limbo at this terrible cold for the second day in a row. 
Some people come from other towns; I didn’t have where to stay for two days. Also, I had a flight on 13th  December 2022 from Heathrow to Frankfurt and lost one day at work worth £250.
I am going to complain about Ryanair, as this airline first keeps people in limbo for 2 days, secondly does not provide information for the airport staff and once I tried to change flight, they didn’t know which flight will leave which not. Also, now when I am trying to claim compensation or refund, they cant even give me back amount spent for the priority boarding or flight.

The staff at the gate were unbothered and clearly seeking to take as many fees from me as possible. They did not make it clear what document they needed and it was only when the gate closed that they accepted the proof I tried to show from the very beginning. I was forced to pay £100 to rebook my flight despite having settled status. They deliberately mislead me in terms of which document I was to show so that I would miss my flight, stalling instead of helping me. I was just 18, travelling alone. These are appalling and extortionate practices. Not to mention the constant delays and ridiculous practices. While waiting for our delayed flight, myself and other passengers had our carry on baggage relentlessly checked. This was to try and extract more money from customers by being overly strict with sizes. This is unlike any other airline or European airport.

I will never ever ever spend another penny with this disgusting cheap airline. I advise everyone to try every other option before giving your money to these piss poor con artists. Also just to top it off when I try to put a delay claim in on their website it says my details are not recognised. Clearly a con to stop me from claiming my money back. Stephen"

But when you want to take more than your pants on holiday with you it becomes expensive. Customer service staff are non existent until boarding commences and that’s only if Ryanair’s contradictory flight information, on either App or airport flight information screen, have given you a fighting chance of being at the right gate to board your plane. Actually getting on and stowing your paid for bag becomes an chaotic farce, with passengers in seat 1A having to fight their way to the back of the aircraft to squeeze hand luggage above seat 32C, whilst being told by dismissive cabin crew to ‘find a space’. Disgraceful treatment of passengers is a conscious choice made at Ryanair boardroom level, I hope the business suffers because of them. Hopefully a new airline will step up and offer a positive customer experience as standard. I’d certainly pay for that!"

The bag allowance the gave is just 1 small backpack that can only fit your boxers. The flight return was £49 but had to pay another £45 each way at airport even though I had very small cabin luggage, and they would not reason with you. So total £90 extra. With easy jet I always take 1 backpack and a small cabin bag, no extra charge.

The staff in the ticket check was rude, and asked us either we pay or go home. In flight attendants were polite. 

Then, we wanted to move the flight earlier as I had urgent work, but the minimum changing fees was £45, on top of the flight fees. Wherein easyjet you can flights with as less as £0-15. So later we decided, even if we take the pre booked return flight, it would cost us at least another £100 extra. So, we threw the return flight ticket on the bin and took a bus back to London. 

Don't think we will ever take Ryanair again. Not saying easy jet is perfect, they have their perks too. But at least no surprises after booking. 

So, be careful with bags, even if they match the bag size recommendation in ticket, these people are not smart enough to realise that, but only how to charge you extra. So maybe pay £20 extra anyway for the bags when buying tickets. Flight change is almost impossible, so book accordingly.

Well one year ago I tried and now I am a really  happy customer of theirs. They have rules very precise and very clearly comunicated when booking. And at every flight there is somebody who tries to carry onboard a trolley without having paid for it, or who has not checked in online as requested. Tickets are dirty cheap, flights delays not worse than other companies, personell polite and working hard, legroom better that many others. My only complain is that the seats are a bit stiff and my bum gets sore after one hour.
Get to know their rules, do all the booking, checking-in, booking change online and Ryanair will become your favorite airline  too."

Their baggage policy is a complete rip off. I had to pay double for my carry on bag because they wouldn't let me bring it on the plane. Despite me already paying to check it in, they made me recheck it and pay double the fee. Compared to easy jet that allows you two carry on pieces for a much smaller fee and is much more clear communication of their baggage policy during the initial flight booking.

People at the counters are rude as well. Very condescending. Also policy around picking up your bording pass is ridiculous. No digital boarding pass available, you must get it at the check in counter even if you're not dropping a bag. 

All in all, more time and money was wasted using Ryan Air than if I had just booked with another airline for a slightly higher ticket price. Would have saved money in the end. This is also not the first time I've had a terrible expience with Ryan Air. I was forgiving before but this how now just solidified my decision to never fly with Ryan Air again.

I wish these comments are read by someone who could actually look into this topic&investigate it. We are being used. I will never fly with them again and don’t recommend them at all.

Of all the messages they send daily and that go to my spam mail, I have found only one about that CRUCIAL act of robbery (so called new policy), and I don’t accept it. It’s not a proper way to acknowledge travellers about something no other airlines is applying. I mean, who would think of such danger, in the first place?! So we ended up buying our tickets again (the fine was the same amount of money as the tickets themselves,  so PLEASE don’t be deceived by the facade of cheap flights, IT IS NOT CHEAP - They exploit people and literally play with one’s IQ).

Another thing - while buying these tickets months ago, we bought two seats, and didn't pay for the third seat, that one was left as random. Despite that fact, when we actually wanted to check in for the return  flight, they asked for 6€ as an online check in fee to get “guaranteed seats”, no matter we paid extra for the 2  seats. So we chose the “non priority”=free check in, which is possible only 24 hours before (many tricks just to confuse people, I just don’t get it how elderly people can even keep track of these cheap, disgusting tricks when it was even difficult for us to survive one weekend trip). So the result was - all of us waited at the “random” queue, no matter 2 of us paid the seats and one didn't, we were all the same sheep who waited half an hour outside, at the airport, freezing (they completed the boarding but the passengers were just hopping off the plane while we were waiting in front of it). Not even 5minutes were spent to prepare the plane for us (I still don’t know how that is just not against the universal rules). So we hop in, of course the seats were again random so we realise the second robbery was for real… ah yes, we attempt to enter the loo, after a long wait (we have a 4year old child) but we can’t because we are already TAKING OFF (the moment we reached the seats) and plus the toilet is clogged. The top of the agony was the announcement of staff blaming previous passengers for the “toilet incident” when we literally boarded just minutes after they left and no preparation was made (I seriously think they are abusing some serious airplane policies and laws here).

All in all, I asked for my money back, for the deceitful check in fee and of course I got a negative answer. 
I will never stop acknowledging people who they are dealing with. This company is dangerous for your mental and very possibly psychical well being - and most important - your dignity.
Before flying with them please put this on a scale - check in fees, waiting time, small baggage and bans of all kinds, bus-like planes, very strange staff and very strange flying experience, no preparation whatsoever of the plane itself, very long and chaotic waiting queues for the shuttles that they have connected and made dependent of their flight at cheap airports.

But....using the website is difficult and frustrating. It feels deliberately designed to confuse travellers into paying for premium services. 
Our recent flight to Tenerife was an awful experience. The 2 rows of young men behind us arrived drunk (for a 7.00 am flight). Cabin crew's approach this was to continue feeding them as much Heineken as the asked for throughout the 4.5 hour flight. That worsened the situation. This mob were bothering other passengers....shouting & singing. Kicking the seats of passengers in front.....trying to dance with cabin crew in a sexually provocative manner and were unable to follow cabin crew instructions on landing endangering other passengers. One of them left his seat immediately after touchdown as the plane was still decelerating on the runway. It felt like cabin crew's priority was to maximise income from in-flight alcohol sales whilst showing complete disregard for the in-flight experience of the majority of passengers. 
We paid £7 to 'upgrade' to seats at the front for the return flight which was fine. 
If there are other options flying where you want to go when you want to go....I would avoid Ryanair if possible."

We showed up 4 hours early, and our email said to check our bags 3 hours before the flight. They were the only airline to not have self check in so we waited 2 hours in line to do so, which I can get past. As we finally got to the front of the line, the woman behind the desk said we couldn’t check our bags until exactly 2 hours before our flight, which was 2:50pm, and our gate was to close at 2:20pm. She told us to wait in line but at that rate waiting through all of it we would probably have less than 20 minutes to go to security, get a bite of food (because the food on the plane was overpriced), and get to our gate before it closed. 

We opted to not listen and instead of going to the back we waited on the side for the rest of the 30 minutes before 12:50 when we were told to come back. They sent multiple people on our flight to the back of the line, which at this point was a roughly 3 hour wait as more people were lining up into the main entrance of the airport. There was only one person doing bag checks so it’s not like it was moving fast either. Some of the people on our flight noticed us and decided to stand on the side and wait because they felt the same as us, we were near the check in counter and were talking about how unorganized this whole situation was. There were no signs stating this, as it seemed the other flights had no issue checking in early, just Stockholm. There were no emails correcting this saying we had to be exactly 2 hours before. Even after showing the clerk she shook her head and told us to go back to the end of the line. After a while our line started to accumulate more people and only then at 12:30 did they decide to get another woman behind the desk to check our bags.

First of all it was the rude behavior and tone she and her young colleagues used and second the absurd fact that my bag fitted perfectly in the cage.

Usually online check -in is purely for passenger convenience, especially if one does not have a bag to check in. 

The morning before my flight I attempted to check-in, and the app would not allow it stating check-in is only available 24 hours beforehand. As I have a a bag to check-in I thought (as with other airlines I have used), I will just arrive at the ajrport early enough and get my boarding pass while checking in my bag. I approached the Ryan Air desk >2 hours before departure (at which point online check-in had been closed). I was then stung with the compulsory 55 euro check-in fee. Ryan Air purposefully prevents online check-in >24 hours and <2-3 hours from your flight, maximising the chance that like me you don't do it in the small window provided so they can exploit a ridiculous fee for absolutely no service. It took the attendant approximately 20 seconds to check me in (something other airline do for free!). 

Worst experience I've had across multiple airlines, and something I have not seen in other airlines that I have used. Disgusted with this ploy, as its main purpose is to exploit it's passengers. 

Beware of this and don't get exploited if you are using them, the airline is out to con / exploit it's customers wherever possible.

I saw this information on the official Stansted website, as well as on two other flight tracking websites, which means we could have arrived to Hamburg with an hour delay, rather than a day and a half later.

They are pretty clear on sizes when booking so don’t be surprised if you get caught out because they do not discriminate whether you be man, woman or child (or anything in between)   

You can get a limited snack selection (again - budget flight, not Gino D’Campo’s pantry) which is the usual that you’d expect - Pringles, Kinder Bueno’s and the like. Don’t know if they do hot food to be fair but Easy Jet seemed to have stopped that so I would imagine Ryanair have as well to save a few pennies. 

Having been on their feet over 13 hours and looking tired and a little bit frazzled, the staff did a good enough job despite the horrid bunch of flyers complaining as though the cabin crew should become Prophets and part the sky much like Moses and the sea. One look out the window and you could see lightning striking over Stansted! 

That being said, there was one moment they announced we were going to Gatwick which caused a brief panic, but they quickly cleared that up as a slip of the tongue. After that long on shift, I can’t be too annoyed when their day has been much worse than mine. 

The seats were as anticipated - they may as well have been white plastic garden chairs stapled to the floor and if you lean forward you could rub your nose against the person in front’s scalp (depending on the person that may be your cup of tea, but not for me). Frankly if you wanted a more comfortable experience, you should have got your wallet out and paid a bit more to go with BA. 

The landing was very good (better on the way home and improved with light hearted comedy about the tragedy of the situation) however there were people who clapped at the end so my overall review is that it was not ideal but passengers made the experience worse."
11.5401563644409,1.85988616943359,"Ryanair Refund Issues",1,"First time ever to opt for some of Ryanair's extras. Never again. Booked a paid for a mid size car with them and paid the extra £30 for full insurance. Thinking because we booked with Ryanair the car would be at the airport. We were wrong. We had to walk all around the airport until we gave up and rang the car company Easirent directly. We had to walk about 10 minutes in the dark looking for a blue shelter. A few minutes later we were collected and driven another ten minutes to some industrial estate. 

Then the real fun started. First I was told that the £30 full insurance I paid Ryanair wouldnt cover anything as they were a third party!  The rep said Ryanair were """"naughty"""" for charging me that. As a result I had to put £1500 protection on my credit card. Apparently if I gave Easirent the £30 this deposit wouldn't have been required.

Then we were offered our car. There was two on the premises. The one we ordered or a micro mini (Fiat 500). We were told the car we ordered had no fuel in it so we would need to find a petrol station and hope it didn't run out along the way or take the micro mini that we didn't order. 

This mico minis are cheaper than the compact car we ordered but they were not offering any discount. Instead she would offer me free fuel. I was told if I returned the car with the same level of fuel I would have free fuel? It took me 5 minutes to explain that if I use a half tank and refil it too half tank then it's not free fuel. I am the one paying for it. 

She continued to tell me that the car had a full tank of fuel. When I inspected it the car had just under half a tank. At 10pm at night she said it's either this or nothing. After more time arguing she agreed to ignore the level of fuel the vehicle was returned with. Then five minutes into our journey we quickly found out the wipers didn't work which made driving in the heavy rain very dangerous, especially going through the city.

Then there was a £50 charge for dropping it to their Manchester depot instead of their Liverpool one. Some other companies charge for this too but not this much. In the end the one day charge for a micro mini to go from the Liverpool Airport to Liverpool City Center and on to Manchester was close to €200

I remember in the past they were increasing the price of the flight if you’d refresh the page or hit something by mistake but now at least this has changed. Nowadays Ryanair tries to pull every penny off you just by being on their website. Everything there has been placed to trick you to spend more money, which someone would argue it’s the goal of every sane company, although Ryanair does it in a very subtle way. Then the day of your flight finally comes and you queue differently based on the fact that you are a priority or non-priority; this only matters if you have a luggage/bag you want to place in the dedicated upper storage unit as if you are a priority boarder you have the chance to put your bag where you want and because only the non-priority will struggle (this is also made on purpose). If you are a priority member you end up queuing almost as much as the non-priority ones. Then you fly. It’s like a market up there, lights on, people that screams to sell you everything they can, and they know that if you sleep you are not likely to buy anything so every 15 minutes you will have someone trying to sell you something. They have no Gluten-free options and you might have to buy a soda only to realise that they don’t provide any ice with it (room temperature sodas are not great). Then you land. You are probably late and the schedule hasn’t been respected (obviously they will blame someone else). The latest time I had to flight with Ryanair I’ve asked a steward “Will there be a time when I land on time with Ryanair?” And he replied “You are the one who chooses to flight with us”. This really put me off guard as I thought he was going to be more respectful of customers. I also wanted to say that instead of choosing I was I had to fly with Ryanair as it was the only airline that could get me to a funeral back home. I found that extremely insensitive, arrogant, cheap and outrageous especially after spending money as a customer with Ryanair. But anyway, nothing will change. My final thoughts are the Ryanair is full of crap but until I will only have them as a choice to go and see my family I will have to keep buying from them. Necessary Evil."

It was busy at Eindhoven airport and people were let through the security gates by order of departing planes. We were traveling with a child. All the time we trusted the process and collaboration between Eindhoven airport and Ryanair. We were at the very front when they let us through only to find out that the gate was closed when we passed the security scans. They proceeded to unload all of our luggage we saw them doing so  (130+ peoples) but refused to talk to us or to let us in the plane and delay it for just 15 minutes. If they had done so all these people would have made their flight. We then had no chance of re-booking and could not make our travel at all. We were stranded for 8 hours, we had to cancel all our reservations many of which are non refundable. We will proceed and we are sharing our story to warn other travelers. I have never in my life had such bad treatment."

This, in my mind is fraudulent sales of a service that the company knows is unworkable but still continues to peddle.

So when I saw their low prices I decided to book a flight with them. Worst decision ever! As soon as we got to the gate, they charged us $91 extra for luggage, even though our luggage fit in the measuring station where you put the carry-on before embarkment. The worst part was the customer service we received. The lady was extremely passive aggressive and wouldn't even listen to us (Ryanair, if you're seeing this review, it's the short blonde lady from the Santorini airport). We wanted to show her that our luggage was correctly sized and she didn't even bother to glance at our carry-ons.

I planned my trip precisely according to the arrival time at the Eindhoven airport, which was supposed to be at 8:40 pm, so i booked my train to Amsterdam at 10 pm so i can arrive to my accommodation at 11:30 pm and enjoy my knight in Amsterdam and enjoy my trip in general, but what happened that the flight was delayed 4 hours and it landed in Brusselse and then the bus took us to Eindhoven and we arrived at 2:30 am when there was no transportation to Amsterdam at all, so i had to wait until 5:30 am to get the bus, and i arrived to my accommodation at 8:30 am, and to arrive i had to pay for uber twice one to go to the bus station in Eindhoven at 5:30 am and the another to reach the hostel at 8:30 am as i was very exhausted by the time of arrival. moreover, the accommodation told me that because I didnt arrive on time they cancelled the reservation and took the money anyway, because it was my fault as they say, eventhough that i wasnt in a good condition to do anything because of the bad trip i had, so i found my self almost out of money and without a place to sleep at and i had to rest in the street because of the bad managment and the costumer service that Ryanair has. The worst part of all this that during the delay of the trip Ryanair did not offer food and drinks for free as it should be according to EU regulations, even food and drinks, can you imagine? i still didn't talk about that they should also provide transportation to the place of accommodation and a place to stay according to the EU law. this experience made me feel how much i was humiliated and disrespected from Ryanair. It made me feel that i had this experience because we did not pay much money for the tickets, even though this is not my problem, this is the business model of Ryanair, and they agreed on the EU regulations if they are not planning to treat the people well and treat them in this un humanitarian way just because that they don't have much money or they are planning for a nice weekend with a fare budget. I am thinking of going with this to the court and telling people about the story of humiliation and disrespectful to human beings in 2022."

After a nice week of vacation we take a Ryanair flight from Porto to Milan, estimated duration: about 2 hours (?). We are almost to our destination but weare told that we cannot land because of a thunderstorm. Result: we stay for more than an hour and a half suspended in the sky amid black clouds, lightning and thunders at close range. After that we are told that it will not be possible to land in Milan, so they take us to another airport (without telling us which one, except once we land!!!!). We finally land in Genoa, tired but glad to be on land. Another hour and a half of waiting and we are told THAT WE WILL BE DEPARTING AGAIN??? In the meantime, no one offers us water, food, but the captain tells us that we have """"permission to contact family and relatives,"""" if we desire....
In the meanwhile, we contact our hotel to alert them to the uncertainty of the situation; they unfortunately warn us that it will not be possible to check in in the middle of the night (it was midnight by then).
We arrive at Milan Linate and manage to catch the last shuttle to downtown Milan, where we squeeze into the first hotel next to the Central Station, in order to make as little distance as possible IN THE MIDNIGHT WITH BAGGAGE AND PERSONAL BELONGINGS.
Bewildered but exhausted and thus resigned, we pay three times the price of the hotel originally booked, which did not allow us to have a refund because of the short notice.
Finally, once back home we decide to pursue a refund request (end of July 2022), promptly rejected because EU261 regulations do not provide for refunds due to """"unforeseeable"""" conditions.
We call support again, who suggests we ask for acompensation instead of a refund (August 2022). In September 2022 I submit the request, in October 2022 I receive no response (waiting time described by the site for processing the request: 10 days), and decide to call the client support again.TThe operators, as always rude and annoyed, say they will send a reminder.

10.324933052063,-0.864593744277954,"Ryanair Flight Delays",1,"As I sit in Lisbon Airport staring at an empty check-in gate hours after another Ryanair flight was due to carry me to lands afar, I can all but wonder what hideous and despicable acts I carried out in my last life to deserve to suffer their service. Perhaps it involved an unsuspecting goat or other farm animals, too late to atone now though.. At least I can pass the time by attempting to dissect the worst aspects of their operations... let's begin. 
1) It all started what now seems a lifetime ago when sitting enjoying the sites of Lisbon City centre when my partner checked the Ryanair app out of mere curiosity to find our flight was delayed by over 3 hours. Inconvenient yes, but perhaps we could enjoy a few extra hours before heading to the airport? A quick chat with customer services should easily tell us if that's OK or whether we must be there for the original departure time. Maybe there is another hidden fee (Ryanair's favourite gut punch) so best be sure. After 20 minutes of fighting the customer service chat feature we gave up. A completely automated response to all questions, none of which related to the query at hand. Yes Skynet is here to ruin us all and its victory shall be swift. 
2) Fast forward to the airport - the main terminal looks nice but we get shuttled off to the budget terminal since Ryanair doesn't want to pay its fees. Fair enough, neither do I, hence this whole predicament. The queue to get checked in would have PETA protesting if we were lambs to the slaughter, currently I wish I had joined that line instead. At least that pain is done for the day (...)
3) Past security, not fun but not the fault of Ryanair at least. The delay is over 4 hours now so a quick search online shows we are entitled to food and drink. Best find a member of their helpful crew who will be happy to help! A walk of all the gates though provides slim pickings... perhaps they don't want to help the people from the growing list of flights being delayed? When we did track down a member of staff at a gate, they responded as if I was asking them to manually check my prostate. We were quickly ushered through a gate to a Ryanair desk that could help (not with the prostate), only to find on going through the door that it was a one way trip - back to the initial check-in slaughterhouse... 
4) I feel by this point we all know what the response was at the check-in desk - go and ask at the gate of course. We tried to argue briefly but it's like farting against thunder. We took the tickets, we accept our fate. At least the comforting knowledge we received from the checkin desk that someone will come out and offer help from Ryanair back at the gate will keep us warm over the upcoming hours of woe. Hopefully we won't all trip over the numerous smiling and helpful staff there or be crushed in the stampede as the rush to assist us. 
5) Back at the gate now. Security was even better the second time around, apparently they don't like boarding passes being used twice. When we mentioned Ryanair though they seemed to get it. Not sure how many hours to go. Perhaps a member of Ryanair will come and offer assistance at some point. Perhaps even food. Or water. Even an update on the flight that keeps getting pushed further back. Perhaps I'll grow a horn and become a unicorn. We can only wait and see. 
Damn you Ryanair. You've hurt me before yet here I sit like an abused lover. You said this time it would be different. You promised to take care of me and make me feel special. But you don't change.  Like a tiger can't change its stripes, you will always be the garbage at the bottom of the airline food chain, leaving me cold and alone on the overcrowded terminal floor. No more Ryanair, this time it is goodbye. Perhaps at the next price slash sale I'll check your horrible website and laugh at the fool I used to be. I hope you get the help you need.

Everyone got out of their seats ready to leave the flight from hell to find out there was nobody available to connect stairs to the flight, so we were to wait another 15minutes!

Me and my brother were planning a trip in a months time so I decided to use the voucher. I kept getting an error when I was at the checkout to say that the name on the voucher had to be a name included in the booking, which it was. After speaking to customer service for 3 hours on Tuesday 13th, I was told it was an error on their side and that I (meaning my friend, who is still apologising for this mess Ryanair has caused) could expect to receive a new voucher in 4-5 days. 

After waiting a week since that conversation, I contacted customer service again on Tuesday 20th September and was told by someone else that their colleague gave me the complete wrong timeline and it would now take 10-15 business days to receive the new voucher.

In this time, me and my brother had booked our outbound flights for our trip and were waiting to use the voucher to book the return flights home. Because of Ryanair's mess, the flights we were to book have sold out and we have no way of returning home from our trip - the flights earlier that day are costing a couple of hundred when the original return flight was about forty euro. Obviously this now means we can no longer go on the trip we had been planning. We've wasted so much time and money organising this and it's completely Ryanair's fault.

I will never understand why this company sells faulty vouchers and then makes you wait up to 3 weeks to get a new one.. which still isn't guaranteed to work. Ryanair need to train their staff properly to not give out wrong information. Not to mention the 4 hours of customer service conversations I had to sit through to get me absolutely nowhere. Useless."

It always seems like you were saving money, but you always pay for it and grief and frustration in the long run. This was my first experience with Ryanair, and I did not expect much. But I got even less! The most entertaining part was when it attempted to charge me €75 for a carry-on. I have traveled all over the world and on so many different airlines, and I’ve never been charged for a carry-on, let alone 75 Euros!
The plane was of course running late, and they were rushing to board us (obviously trying to maintain some sort of schedule for their flight record). When they hustled me through the gate they told me that I had to pay €75 for my carry-on, and I told the guy that was ridiculous. He said “Well you could go back and re-check in and only pay €10 but it’s too late now because the flight is running late, and you have to board now, so pay €75, or leave your bag here” Once again I told him that was “unacceptable”, so he said “OK how about €49”. I’m sure they’d stay there longer I could’ve negotiated him down further… But since there was a long line behind me, and again we were already running late, I decided to pay the €50 and get on the flight.
Once on board, I tried to put the experience behind me, I ordered a beer and sat back to try relax. They brought me a beer and a disposable plastic Dixie cup, so I open the can poured the cup, and was looking forward to a nice refreshing beer, but of course the beer was warm. I rang the bell for the flight attendant and several minutes later they came and I said the spears warm can you bring me a cold one…. 15 minutes later they came back with the same beer opened and half empty with a new Dixie cup, and said they had chilled the beer for me. I said “I’d ask for a new cold beer“… And the flight attendant replied “you already opened it so you get the same beer. if you want a new one you will pay for another beer”…. Unbelievable!!… I told him this was a terrible way to treat customers and his response was “You’re from America aren’t you”!! Is America the only place in the world where you expect a beer to be cold?? Nice racist comment by the flight attendant!

I chose this flight, because of the possibility to by for additional money seat C1 in the first row, as i have an official doctor's opinion and confirmation of the aerophobia illness, usually i have dyspnea and panic attacks (will be provided if needed to Ryanair officials). When i entered plane my pre-booked seat was occupied and i was offered to go to the 16th row, for a person who has aerophobia it's like a death sentence, especially if you fly alone. Of course, i refused and asked to free my guaranteed seat, no one from the flight attendant event did try to find out why this is so important for me. When the flight attendant (male) who was speaking first Russian with me and only when i asked to speak with me in English he started to use English, when i asked both flight attendants to tell me their names and surnames - they refused to do it, further flight attended (male) in an aggressive way told me that because of such people as me refuges from Ukraine can't sit in a plane together and do I even know what compassion is? Those who know me - know how much i support Ukrainian refugees all these days  (giving shelter, donating money ..) and in this minute i felt like nothingness, nothing heart more when you spend all your free time, help people but then young male simple say to you you are miserable.

Throughout my journey I had 2 flights with Ryanair and both were 3+hrs delayed. When I arrived to the connecting airport, the gate had already closed due to the delay. All they did was apologise for it onboard the plane. On the website Ryanair state we are entitled to compensation if there was a delay of 3+hrs. However, this was not the case. I have emailed them multiple times and tried to contact them but there is no answer, therefore the whole compensation is nothing but a lie to lure you in and take your money.

Due to this we were stuck in Germany with no option but to purchase an expensive same day flight with another airline to get to our destination which costed us £800. Plus losing out on our first night of hotel and other acitivies. We missed our friends wedding and everything was in shambles thanks to Ryanair.

Do not, I repeat do not purchase a Ryanair flight especially if its a connecting flight because you will most likely miss it!!! It is better to pay extra for a direct flight with another airline trust me. We were not the only ones who suffered but also everyone else on the same plane.

Our flight was delayed by 14 hours back in July (flight vhz56x). Originally the flight was planned for 7:30pm, we didn’t end up leaving until 9:30 the next morning. There was no organisation at the airport from Ryanair staff whatsoever and all of the passengers from the flight were left standing in the airport until at least 1am until staff finally handed our Eu - 261 forms (which entitle passengers to compensation for delayed flights of over 5 hours) and explained we would have to find our own accomodation if we didn’t want to sleep on the airport floor, but we would supposedly be “covered” to claim back expenses in this case.

We filled in our eu-261 claim 2 days after the delayed flight (4th of July) along with our expense report for the overnight hotel we had to find, and funnily enough.. we are yet to have any response.

In the airport, staff told us our claims would be processed within 10 working days. Once this time frame had passed, we contacted Ryanair by phone, only to be told it can take up to 28 working days… okay.
We wait 28 working days and call again (it has been 55 working days at this point just to make sure we are being fair..) and the “customer service” rep explains (in a manner that seemed as though we were asking him to do something other than the job he is paid for) “it will take as long as it takes” before proceeding to hang up. 

The compensation (€250 euros is one thing) but we are also out expenses for having to find an overnight hotel. The delay also caused us to obviously miss a night of accommodation in our destination, which is money we will never get back.

When she asked my wife smiled as was surprised author petty she was being and she instantly got a reply of """"what do you think you are laughing at and it not funny"""". Lorna then continued to be rude and insulting with Mila watching on. I told her this was not good enough and asked for her name which she gave me. I then asked for her colleagues name and was replied with """"no, I will not give you her name and why don't you ask her yourself if you want it"""". I turned to Mila and asked for her name. She stared at me and in an aggressive manor said """"Mila"""". I wanted to get the spelling correct so I asked her to spell it for me. Instead of spelling it she said """"Mila"""" again. I explained to her I wanted the spelling of her name as she clearly didn't want to give it to me and she replied """"what, you think my name is funny do you""""? I had given her no reason to think I was finding her name funny and then realised a out of the blue, aggressive, argumentative response was a clear attempt to try and cause an argument and get me cross in the hope I reacted and then she could call security. I kept calm and asked for her name spelling again. She said very quickly so I am not 100% sure this is correct. As I put it in my phone she continued with her rudeness and attempt to get me to react by saying things such as """"its a joke I have to deal with people like you"""" and """"Customers like you shouldn't be allowed on the plane"""".

An hour or so into the flight she was again amazing when my mother had travel sickness and made sure we were all okay and had everything needed. Whilst on the flight the """"supervisor"""" or 'head"""" flight attendant was incredibly rude to Georgia who after speaking we found out was only her 2nd day as a flight attendent. The way this other woman spoke to this young girl was awful, the passengers infront of us also picked up on this and reminded Georgia she was doing an amazing job. I would never have guessed it was her 2nd day she was so confident and helpful. The other lady (spanish I think) however spoke to her as if she was beneath her, I think she needs to be humbled and remember we all have to start somewhere and once upon a time she was a newbie too before working her way up. All it takes is a little kindness and support instead of being so rude and demanding her like she didnt have feelings. I just hope that one attendant hasnt put her off her career path. Lots of people were quick to praise Georgia when getting off the flight and thanking her for all she did whilst on flight, no surprise the rude lady didn't get the same response and instead lots of passengers had nothing but complaints about the way they picked up on her tone towards Georgia.

Our outward flight was on the 3rd September from Malaga Airport on Ryanair FR2274.
The Notice board told us to check in at G64. When we got there no board was set up showing which side Priority tickets should queue and naturally no Ryanair staff could be seen. After waiting for a good 25 minutes one did appear and informed us we needed to go to G54 to check in.
We then had a long walk to G54 and on arriving there, we naturally lost our place in the queue.
One of the passengers, NOT even a Ryanair staff member, told us that this was not the right check in gate, but need to go to G43.
Again, a long walk to the third check in counter where the queue was even longer and again no clear indication of where to queue for priority boarding.
We were standing in a disorganized queue for a good 30 minutes in a poorly cooled building in sweltering heat until the boarding process started.
We then had a long walk across the airport down a flight of steps and up a rickety flight of steps to get into the plane.
On reaching Budapest, we were loaded onto a coach stuffed like cattle and driven to the airport building.
A journey to remember – or better still forget.
Our return to Malaga was on the 10th September on Ryanair FR223, which started to look fairly well organized, but then the sheer lack of common sense struck.
We were in a terminal within easy walking distance of our plane, so things looked promising. After ten minutes or so of checking in , they opened the doors to go down to the tarmac.
We went about 25 metres on the tarmac when we were stopped by a barrier and had to stand outside in a cold wind for a good 25 to 30 minutes while they were fuelling the plane. Why they could not wait to send us out into the wind till the fuelling was at least half completed thus reducing our exposure to the cold is beyond me.

Worst airline ever! Rude staff on the desk asking to pay for my luggage going back to UK but never had a problem flying in to Milan. She was saying I am not a priority passenger! Charge me €92 for 2 luggage that clearly met the requirements and if I don't pay she will hold my passport then arguments started! I asked her if she knows what is written in the 1st page of my passport? Well I did educate her and also told her that being an airline staff she should know that she cannot hold it against the will of the passport holder. Then she gave my passport back straight away. Tbey also damaged luggage!!! Flights are 2 hours delayed back and forth with no little remorse to all of us tired passengers not alone a free coffee or water at least!

So despite paying for priority boarding, I was one of the last people to board.

We had tried to check in a week ago, but we didn't because the only way to do so was to pay an additional fee for our seats. Therefore, we decided to wait and check in at the desk, like we have done with numerous other airlines in the past.

We argued that we should have been informed of this at the time of booking or via email. The lady at the check in desk kept repeating that the information SHOULD be on the website. After she spoke on the phone for a couple of minutes, she told us """"It’s okay, you don’t have to pay for a seat.... but THERE ARE NO SEATS LEFT ON THIS FLIGHT”. 
Ryanair over book the flights and despite arriving in plenty of time, we can’t get on! She had no information about when the next flight is and there was no manager, or information desk, to talk to.

At the end of the flight she had asked the stuardess 4 times where her bag was moved to. The stuardess point blankly ignored her and rolled her eyes, eventually admitting that she moved her bag towards the back of the plane with an awful attitude and arrogance. Later when my friend had to wait practically until the whole plane was empty she found her bag way down the plane somewhere near the middle isle.

The floor was filthy, full of debris, wrappers and crumbs, seats were dirty and full of food crumbs, the forward bathroom had run out of hand-soap and the toilet and sink looked like they hadn't been cleaned in months!

We were held on a staircase while the plane was offloading passengers and as soon as the very last passenger walked past us we were allowed to board - clearly no time to clean the aircraft. Perhaps they were running late but there is no excuse for lack of cleaning - it spoilt what was otherwise a great flight. 

There was clearly no evidence that any contact surfaces had been sanitised or even wiped. What happened to the new regime of sanitisation, cleanliness and infection prevention that was so important only 2 years ago?

On a more positive note the cabin crew were very efficient and friendly. Priority check in and on-board bags works very well. Just bear in mind that if you have onward connection or resort transfer booked you'll still have to wait for every other passenger who has checked-in hold baggage. It was 1 hour before our coach could leave the airport so it defeated the object to of priority. It's worth doing but we'll book a private transfer next time. We paid extra to sit together too. 

All in all a good experience - even though my several attempts via the Ryanair website at seeing if they could do anything for us (I offered to pay) as it was our honeymoon. I thought it would have been a nice touch. I even spoke to the cabin crew on boarding and gave her my wife's seat number and asked if she would perhaps bring a glass of Prosecco over as a """"surprise"""" (again I'd pay) - but she just forgot. It just seemed like they didn't care.

The 3 friends with me were traveling back to Dublin on July 14th to Dublin to catch their Aer Lingus flight home. My return flight to Dublin was July 27th/2022 & 5 days before I left Canada, I was informed by Ryanair that my flight on July 27th was canceled and I could either change my date of return or claim back 1/2 of my for the canceled portion of my flight. Since changing my flight was not an option to me, as it would have cost me an additional €300.00 for a hotel room for the night plus food (which is more than the total cost of my return flight). My only other option was to find another flight with another airline, which in this case was Aer Lingus, so I booked a return flight with them on July 27th for £78.00, much, much cheaper than the cost of a hotel etc. At any rate, I proceeded with my Ryanair claim for my canceled flight that was canceled by them & when I tried to process my claim, the end result was that it wouldn't go through and the reason given at the end of the claim """"was that this flight was not canceled """". I then sent the email that I received from them telling me that my flight was canceled (OVER 6 WKS AGO) & I haven't heard a single word from them since, UNBELIEVABLE  !!!!!!!! in this day & age of TERRIBLE customer service.

The flight was on time, indeed it left a couple of minutes early.

Boarding was well organised.

Sure, it's all done on the cheap, and you'll end up seriously forking out if you're daft enough not to read & follow the T&Cs, so ..."

You can’t select a seat with child and when you  choose  2 separate seats they ask you that you can’t book the flight because child need to be next adult but of course you have to pay extra for that.

Couldn't check in on line because her age noted that she was not an adult. 7 of us traveling together, their system wouldn't allow everyone else to check in individually. Tried calling them which is a waste of time because one answers and it sends you to the website. Got to the airport and they charged us 300 euros to check us in. Great scam they have set up!! Of course writing customer service they put it back on us that we didn't call them. 

I have no illusions that they will give me a refund, all i hope for is the everyone write bad reviews and we put them out of business. Not an airline i will ever use again regardless of how cheap it is. Remember not cheap after they get done scamming you."

They said there was no flight till the following day. we just got told to stay in the airport for 18 hours. No accommodation offered, and they gave us 4 euro voucher for food and drink. this was just enough for a coffee.
I submitted my claim on return on to have to keep on escalating it with no correspondence from Ryan air. I'm still waiting 2 months after my flight. I have spoke to many customer service agents who have lied to me and put the phone.  down on me just because i asked to speak to a manager.

Scheduled to leave at 10.55pm but when we got there the screen showed no delay.  My husband happened to check Ryanair app and noticed that there was a half hour delay. No update on the screen at the airport. We checked the app again about half hour later to see that it had been delayed even more by another half hour, again no update on screen.  Checked yet again, delayed even more and eventually ended up over 2 hours delay.  
The plane was not even Ryanair but Lauda air. Fair enough it was a different plane maybe due to the delay.  The cabin crew were awful, rushing everyone on and telling everyone off for not being seated quick enough! As if it was our fault for the delay and they wanted to get home!!  The staff were miserable.  No refreshments on the plane either to finish off what was an awful experience.

Finally landed at Stansted at 2.15am.

Thank you Ryanair!!!"

Constantly crashes. If you book them via a 3rd party ( ie an online holiday tour operator) you have to go through awful verification process that I tried several times on different devices and just did not not work. They have the cheek of charging for this verification as well . Called customer services 6 times in 1 day with 15min wait each time. Only to be faced with robotic agent who is only interested in ending the call and moving on to the next person. After this holiday I'm not using them again. Its just been so stressful."

So in a nut shell Flight booked this year £96.00, money paid back in 2020 £157.86 so they want £253.86 for a basic one way flight to Alicante.
To make matters worst any number you ring they hang up when you try to explain to them, also they do not respond to any emails.
I'm sure what they are doing is illegal"

The check in experience is a ripoff. They make you pay 65€ to get your boarding pass at the front desk otherwise they won’t deliver you the boarding pass. This is outrageous. Aircraft are very small and super packed. No room for legs at all , no room for a carry on. You cannot bend your seat. The crew is rude and unprofessional.

Upon arrival, we were told to check-in on phone to save not having to pay extra at the desk to be checked in. We then commenced the process of checking in the 6 passengers (4 children, 2 adults). On the final screen for payment, the total cost was wrong as the App automatically added extra bag for each passenger rather than just 2 extra bags to be checked in. We went back on the app to update this which we successfully did. When it took us to the next screen to make payment of roughly 96 euros, the app not came with error saying “oops there has been a problem…”. We then asked the counter staff for assistance at this stage upon which we were informed that we have now missed the “2hrs” before flight checkin by 1 MINUTE and have to now pay an extra 330 euros if we still want to check in. This is in addition to the 96 euros for the bags so total of 426 euros had to be paid there and then as we have now missed the automatic time by a minute whilst at the desk sorting payment for extra bag. This has to be the harshest penalty in history and they adviced us to reach out to Ryanair for some sort of refund. To topple this, after reluctantly making the payment, we’re now being adviced that our flight has now been delayed by an extra 1hr 10mins a least which technically means we’re now checked in 3 full hours before our flight instead of 2hrs but still had to pay the penalty. 
 
So in total, 426 euros stolen from us by Ryain Air. Needless to say, they will NEVER see our business again!  Written to their complaints department and their response was basically “oh well, check in 2hrs before your flight, see you on your next trip”.
